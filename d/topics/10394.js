The diagnosis of Eisenmenger syndrome implies that the development of pulmonary arterial disease is a consequence of increased pulmonary blood flow, and requires exclusion of other causes of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).</p><p>Management of Eisenmenger syndrome patients includes treatment pertinent to all patients with cyanotic heart disease as well as recommendations specific to CHD-PAH and Eisenmenger syndrome. Issues specific to CHD-PAH and Eisenmenger syndrome will be reviewed here.</p><p>Evaluation and prognosis of Eisenmenger syndrome and recommendations for patients with cyanotic heart disease (including those with Eisenmenger syndrome) are discussed separately.

Care of adults with CHD-related pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) including those with Eisenmenger syndrome should be performed in centers that have shared expertise and training in both adult CHD and PAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In the past, the management of patients with Eisenmenger syndrome was primarily conservative, with an emphasis on regular informed cardiovascular follow-up. Subsequent clinical research evaluated the use of therapies designed to improve patient survival and functional capacity. Pulmonary vasodilator therapy may improve hemodynamics and quality of life in some patients. Other important aspects of management include avoidance of high-risk situations outlined below, extreme caution when undertaking noncardiac surgery, and specific attention to hematologic issues. Heart and lung transplantation, or lung transplantation with repair of the cardiac defect, is appropriate in some patients with severe disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with CHD and PAH should be seen by a CHD-PAH trained provider at least yearly.

Because of the high risk of maternal mortality, pregnancy is <strong>contraindicated</strong> in women with Eisenmenger syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Maternal issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported rate of maternal mortality in Eisenmenger syndrome has ranged from 30 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/2,4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-8</a>], a value that has not changed significantly in the past 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/4,5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7,8</a>].

The fixed pulmonary arterial resistance cannot accommodate to the hemodynamic fluctuations of labor, delivery, and the puerperium. Most deaths are due to thromboembolism, volume depletion, which can augment the right-to-left shunt and precipitate intense cyanosis, and preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>].

Only 15 to 25 percent of pregnancies progress to term and at least 50 percent of infants are born prematurely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/2,4,5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5,7,8</a>]. Spontaneous abortion occurs in 20 to 40 percent of pregnancies, at least 20 to 30 percent of infants born have intrauterine growth retardation, and perinatal mortality has ranged from 7 to 28 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/2,4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-8</a>].</p><p>Another issue in the fetus is recurrence of congenital heart disease (CHD).

It does not appear to be related to the degree of cyanosis or coagulation abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In two reports, significant in situ proximal pulmonary artery thrombus was seen in 21 and 29 percent of patients with Eisenmenger syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Some patients may also have distal arterial thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Pulmonary parenchymal findings included embolic infarcts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Structural and functional changes in the pulmonary vasculature probably play a role in the development of in situ pulmonary artery thrombosis. The large arteries dilate and become aneurysmal, contributing to stasis and thrombus formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, endothelial damage due to increased shear stress, increased blood viscosity, and hypoxemia may all contribute to a prothrombotic state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>The consequences of pulmonary artery thrombosis in Eisenmenger syndrome vary. Massive thrombosis can lead to asphyxic death and augmented right-to-left shunts by increasing flow resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], while the presence of more distal thrombosis and intraparenchymal infarction raises concern that pulmonary artery thrombosis may contribute to the progression of pulmonary vascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Most clinicians who care for complex congenital heart disease patients recommend anticoagulation for Eisenmenger patients with pulmonary arterial thrombosis. However, there are no data to support routine anticoagulation in this patient population. Anticoagulation can provoke hemoptysis. In addition, anticoagulation in cyanotic patients requires citrate adjustment for accurate international normalized ratio (INR) quantification. Improper INR monitoring has led to deaths in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>. The risk-benefit ratio must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">NONCARDIAC SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any surgical procedure, even if relatively minor, is potentially life-threatening in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and is associated with a perioperative mortality of up to 19 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The risk is especially increased when the operation is done emergently, is lengthy and associated with hemodynamic instability necessitating large-volume fluid resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Surgery or cardiac catheterization should be performed only at a center with expertise in the management of Eisenmenger syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In emergent or urgent situations in which transportation is not feasible, caregivers in centers with expertise in the care of patients with Eisenmenger syndrome should be consulted throughout care. A multidisciplinary approach is imperative and should include involvement of a senior cardiac anesthesiologist, an experienced surgeon, and a cardiologist experienced with the care of Eisenmenger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preoperative clinical assessment should include routine laboratory evaluation. The ideal hematocrit for the Eisenmenger patient undergoing noncardiac surgery is uncertain, but is likely to be less than 65 percent. In patients with higher values, preoperative phlebotomy may improve the coagulation status.

Transplantation should be reserved for severely symptomatic patients, since overall survival with medical management is usually quite good even in patients with severe pulmonary arterial disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/3,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,37</a>]. In one report of 37 patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), the one- and three-year survival rates were 97 and 77 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Outcomes are also reasonably good in patients who undergo transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. The largest transplantation experience comes from a review of 605 Eisenmenger patients in the United Network for Organ <span class=\"nowrap\">Sharing/International</span> Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation joint thoracic registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eisenmenger syndrome was associated with atrial septal defect in 171, ventricular septal defect in 161, multiple congenital anomalies in 68, and patent ductus arteriosus in 32. The most common procedure was heart-lung transplantation (430 patients) compared to 106 bilateral and 69 single lung transplants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient survival was greater with heart-lung transplantation compared to isolated lung transplantation (81 versus 68 percent at 30 days and 70 versus 55 percent at one year). The benefit of heart-lung transplantation was greatest in patients with a ventricular septal defect as the cause of Eisenmenger syndrome, while the outcomes were worst in patients with an atrial septal defect.</p><p/><p>Longer-term follow-up was provided in a series of 51 patients with Eisenmenger syndrome who underwent heart-lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Eight patients (16 percent) died early and the 1-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 73, 51, and 28 percent, respectively. These outcomes were the same as those in patients undergoing heart-lung transplantation for other indications.</p><p>Despite the potential limitations of registry data, heart-lung transplantation appears to be the preferred procedure, particularly in patients with unsuccessfully repaired or uncorrectable lesions, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severely depressed left ventricular function. However, the choice of procedure in an individual patient must take into account other factors. Advantages of isolated lung transplantation include shorter time on cardiopulmonary bypass and better use of the limited supply of donor organs, since the cardiac defects in the native heart can be repaired. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-lung-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heart-lung transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The use of donor organs can be further optimized with single lung transplantation, which may be associated with late reversal of arteriopathy in the remaining native lung. However, cardiac repair with bilateral lung transplantation has a more manageable postoperative course and greater functional reserve than single lung transplantation. At the least, heart-lung transplantation is warranted if the cardiac repair is not straightforward. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-general-guidelines-for-recipient-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: General guidelines for recipient selection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-lung-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heart-lung transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with congenital heart disease who may require lung or heart-lung transplantation should be evaluated and managed in tertiary care centers with medical and surgical personnel with experience and expertise in the management of congenital heart disease and lung or heart-lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-eisenmenger-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2026514605\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The diagnosis of Eisenmenger syndrome implies that the development of pulmonary arterial disease is a consequence of increased pulmonary blood flow, and requires exclusion of other causes of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) and PAH should be seen by a CHD-PAH trained provider at least yearly. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several situations that are associated with a markedly increased risk in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and should therefore be avoided, particularly pregnancy, volume depletion, isometric exercise, high altitude, and endocardial pacing. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Things to avoid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iron deficiency may be present in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome, resulting in relative anemia even in the face of elevated hemoglobin levels, and must be managed with care. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Things to avoid'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary artery thrombosis is common among adults with Eisenmenger syndrome. The benefit of anticoagulation has not been proven and should be considered on a case-by-case basis. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary artery thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any surgical procedure, even if relatively minor, is potentially life-threatening in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome. Surgery or cardiac catheterization should be performed only at a center with expertise in the management of Eisenmenger syndrome. Meticulous care of intravenous lines is required to avoid the risk of paradoxical air emboli. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Noncardiac surgery'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Air emboli'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advanced therapy for pulmonary hypertension to promote pulmonary vasodilation in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome may improve quality of life and retrospective data suggest a survival benefit.
