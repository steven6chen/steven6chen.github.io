The condition is sometimes called &quot;wry neck.&quot; In torticollis, the head tilts to one side and the chin points in the opposite direction.</p><p>Torticollis is common in children, and babies can have it at birth. The medical term for this is &quot;congenital torticollis.&quot; The word &quot;congenital&quot; means a condition a person is born with. Doctors do not know the exact cause of congenital torticollis, but it can run in families.</p><p>Torticollis can also be caused by another medical condition, such as a muscle strain, bad reaction to medicine, or a problem with the spine that makes the neck twist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11692758\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of torticollis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of congenital torticollis can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head tilted to one side</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chin pointed to the opposite side from the head tilt. For example, if a baby's head tilts to the right, the chin points to the left.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lump on the side of the neck that the head tilts toward. For example, if a baby's head tilts to the right, the lump is on the right side of the neck.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Face that looks uneven, with one side that does not match the other</p><p/><p>Symptoms of torticollis caused by a medical condition can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble moving the head, neck, or both</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting, looking pale, being irritable or sleepy, and being less coordinated than normal. Babies and children can have &quot;attacks&quot; of these symptoms that last a few hours or days. Then the symptoms go away on their own.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tight jaw muscles, muscle spasms, and trouble speaking. These torticollis symptoms can be caused by a bad reaction to certain medicines.</p><p/><p>In babies born with torticollis, symptoms usually show up by 2 to 4 weeks after birth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11692772\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. The doctor or nurse should be able to tell if your child has torticollis by doing an exam. Depending on the type of torticollis, he or she might order imaging tests. These can include ultrasound, X-ray, CT, or MRI scans. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body. They can show the cause of torticollis, including other conditions that need treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11692789\"><span class=\"h1\">How is torticollis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital torticollis sometimes goes away without treatment, but not always. If congenital torticollis is not treated, it can make one side of a child's face look different from the other side. This can be permanent.</p><p>Treatments for congenital torticollis can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stretches and position changes you do with your baby at home. These can help straighten out the neck. Your doctor or nurse will tell you if you should try these.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery</p><p/><p>For torticollis caused by another condition, treatment depends on the cause. Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicine to relieve pain, relax tight muscles, or fight infection, if the torticollis is caused by infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A collar that supports and straightens the neck, called a &quot;cervical collar&quot;</p><p/><p>If a child's neck is twisted in an accident, he or she needs treatment right away. <strong>Call for an ambulance (dial 9-1-1 in the US and Canada)</strong> and do not move the child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11692804\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neck-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Neck pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-appearance-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Newborn appearance (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neck-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Neck pain (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
