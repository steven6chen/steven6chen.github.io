Kidney volume increases by up to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], primarily due to an increase in renal vascular and interstitial volume.

These global hemodynamic changes include increased renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F66445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66445 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2321070327\"><span class=\"h3\">Glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, and serum creatinine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal plasma flow increases by up to 80 percent by 12 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], but then decreases in the third trimester. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate disconnect in late gestation'</a> below.)</p><p>The increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is observed within one month of conception, peaks at approximately 40 to 50 percent above baseline levels by the early second trimester, and then declines slightly toward term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Of note, in late gestation, left lateral positioning increases glomerular filtration rate and sodium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The physiologic increase in GFR during pregnancy results in a decrease in serum creatinine concentration, which falls by an average of 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (35 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> to a normal range of 0.4 to 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (35 to 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thus, a serum creatinine of 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (88 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> while normal in a nonpregnant individual, reflects renal impairment in a pregnant woman. Blood urea nitrogen levels fall to approximately 8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.9 to 3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> for the same reason.</p><p>Hence, a small rise in serum creatinine usually reflects a marked reduction in renal function. For example, in a physiologic study, women with preeclampsia had a 40 percent reduction in GFR as compared with control pregnant women (89 versus 149 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> body surface area), but their serum creatinine levels remained within the normal range (0.89 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in preeclamptic versus 0.60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in control pregnancies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Careful attention to small fluctuations in serum creatinine is required to detect renal injury in pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523600013\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanisms of increased glomerular filtration rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several mechanisms contribute to decreased vascular resistance, increased renal plasma flow, and increased GFR during pregnancy. Reduced vascular responsiveness to vasopressors such as angiotensin 2, norepinephrine, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is well documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This may be mediated, in part, by altered vascular receptor expression. For example, vascular expression of the AT2 receptor, which produces vasodilation rather than vasoconstriction in response to angiotensin II, is increased in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Nitric oxide synthesis increases during normal pregnancy and may contribute to the systemic and renal vasodilation and the fall in blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H486906888\"><span class=\"h4\">Relaxin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additionally, the ovarian hormone and vasodilator relaxin is a key mediator of enhanced nitric oxide signaling in pregnancy. Relaxin is a peptide hormone in the insulin family; it is normally produced in the corpus luteum, and in pregnancy is secreted in large amounts by the placenta and decidua in response to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115434\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115434 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Relaxin increases endothelin and nitric oxide production in the renal circulation, leading to generalized renal vasodilation, decreased renal afferent and efferent arteriolar resistance, and a subsequent increase in renal blood flow and GFR. Chronic administration of relaxin to conscious male and castrated female rats mimics the renal hemodynamic changes of pregnancy (20 to 40 percent increase in GFR and renal plasma flow); these changes can be abolished by the administration of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In pregnant rats, increases in GFR and renal plasma flow can also be abolished by the administration of antirelaxin antibodies or by oophorectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Relaxin has systemic hemodynamic effects which may be beneficial in human disease, particularly heart failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-and-emerging-therapies-for-heart-failure#H1806037902\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational and emerging therapies for heart failure&quot;, section on 'Serelaxin'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate disconnect in late gestation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early in pregnancy, the increase in GFR primarily results from increased renal plasma flow. Later in gestation, renal plasma flow falls toward pre-pregnancy levels, but GFR is maintained at a high level, and accordingly, filtration fraction rises. This change in the relationship between renal plasma flow and GFR in the later phases of pregnancy may be due to decreased capillary oncotic pressure, increased glomerular capillary pressure, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased hydraulic permeability and surface area of the glomerular filtration barrier.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2100285432\"><span class=\"h3\">Estimation of GFR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endogenous creatinine clearance, measured by 24-hour urine collection, remains the standard of care for estimation of GFR in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Commonly used creatinine-based estimating formulas should not be used in pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. All GFR formulas, including the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations, consistently and significantly underestimate true GFR in pregnancy.</p><p>However, 24-hour urine collection is cumbersome for the patient, and both over- and under-collection are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Inaccurate collection may be due, in part, to urinary stasis from dilatation of the lower urinary tract in pregnancy: Several hundred milliliters of urine can be trapped in the dilated ureters, resulting in a significant lapse between urine formation and urine collection. For this reason, it is important to assess the adequacy of the collection by measuring urine creatinine excretion. A complete 24-hour urine collection will contain 10 to 15 mg of creatinine per kg body weight, using either prepregnancy or current maternal weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Several authors have published normal reference ranges for laboratory results in pregnant women, which vary slightly by gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].

The physiological responses to changes in osmolality above or below the new set point (ie, thirst and release of ADH from the pituitary) are intact.</p><p>Hyponatremia of pregnancy appears to be mediated by hormonal factors. The fall in the plasma sodium concentration during pregnancy correlates closely with increased production of hCG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Furthermore, the administration of hCG to normal women during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle can induce a similar resetting of the thresholds for ADH release and thirst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27</a>]. Rather than acting directly, hCG appears to produce these changes via the release of relaxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As an example, hyponatremia in pregnant rats can be corrected by the administration of antirelaxin antibodies or by oophorectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As noted above, relaxin also plays an important role in the increased glomerular filtration rate in pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H3030436467\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic changes'</a> above.)</p><p>A serum sodium concentration below 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in pregnancy should prompt evaluation for pathologic causes of hyponatremia, such as syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion. Evaluation of hyponatremia in such cases can be approached similarly to nonpregnant individuals. Hypernatremia, particularly in the setting of polyuria, should spur an evaluation for possible diabetes insipidus.

Circulating antiangiogenic factors, which cause glomerular endothelial dysfunction and proteinuria in preeclampsia, increase toward term and may contribute to late gestational proteinuria even in nonpreeclamptic pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Urine protein excretion is even higher in uncomplicated twin pregnancy, which can lead to diagnostic confusion when evaluating a woman for preeclampsia, because values greater than 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> are considered abnormal by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Although progesterone-induced bladder wall relaxation may lead to increased capacity, the enlarging uterus displaces the bladder superiorly and anteriorly, and flattens it, which can decrease capacity.

Frequency appears to be multifactorial which is in part due to changes in bladder function and in part to a small increase in urine output. Urinary frequency typically begins in the first trimester; thus, mechanical compression of the bladder by the enlarged uterus is not likely to be the primary cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/49,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Nocturia is common and increases with advancing gestation. In a survey of 256 pregnant women, 86 percent reported nocturia by the third trimester, with 20 percent of women indicating they voided three or more times nightly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The major cause of nocturia appears to be that pregnant women excrete larger amounts of sodium and water during the night than nonpregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In the latter stages of pregnancy, this may be partially attributable to nocturnal mobilization of dependent edema when the woman is in the lateral position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The possibility of diabetes insipidus in pregnancy is considered in women with severe polyuria and nocturia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyuria-and-diabetes-insipidus-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polyuria and diabetes insipidus of pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urgency and incontinence</strong> &ndash; Several studies have described an increase in urinary frequency, urgency, and incontinence during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/51,52,55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52,55,56</a>], which may be due to uterine pressure on the bladder, hormonal effects on the suspensory ligaments of the urethra, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> altered neuromuscular function of the urethral striated sphincter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology/abstract/45,52,57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,52,57,58</a>].

Bladder <span class=\"nowrap\">sensitivity/sensation</span> is also decreased from trauma. As a result, detrusor atony, increased postvoid residual urine, bladder overdistention, and urinary retention are frequently encountered in women in the first few days after delivery. These symptoms are typically mild, transient, and completely reversible.

Kidney volume increases by up to 30 percent, primarily due to an increase in renal vascular and interstitial volume. (See <a href=\"#H1835329913\" class=\"local\">'Size'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal blood flow rise markedly during pregnancy, resulting in a physiologic fall in the serum creatinine concentration. A serum creatinine of 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in a pregnant woman probably reflects significant renal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H2321070327\" class=\"local\">'Glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, and serum creatinine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several mechanisms contribute to decreased vascular resistance, increased renal plasma flow, and increased GFR during pregnancy. Reduced vascular responsiveness to vasopressors such as angiotensin 2, norepinephrine, and antidiuretic hormone is well documented. Additionally, the ovarian hormone and vasodilator relaxin is a key mediator of enhanced nitric oxide signaling in pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H523600013\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of increased glomerular filtration rate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The best method to estimate GFR in pregnancy is by 24-hour urine collection for creatinine clearance. Completeness of the collection should be confirmed by checking the 24-hour creatinine excretion (10 to 15 mg <span class=\"nowrap\">creatinine/day</span> per kg body weight is consistent with a complete collection). Estimating equations, such as the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations, are not accurate in pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H2100285432\" class=\"local\">'Estimation of GFR'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other physiologic changes in pregnancy include respiratory alkalosis, mild hyponatremia, glucosuria, and proteinuria up to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.
