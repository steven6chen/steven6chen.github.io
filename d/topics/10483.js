After birth, the DA undergoes active constriction and eventual obliteration. A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occurs when the DA fails to completely close after delivery.</p><p>Preterm infants with moderate to large left-to-right shunts have a greater mortality rate than those without a PDA. They also have an increased risk of pulmonary edema and hemorrhage and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, as well as a decrease in perfusion and oxygen delivery to end-organs. As a result, management of preterm infants with clinically significant PDAs has been focused on PDA closure and prevention. The management of PDA in preterm infants will be reviewed here. The pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of PDA in preterm infants are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17050060\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1529742\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment and prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over the last several decades, research efforts have focused on preventing and closing PDA in preterm infants. Current practice is primarily focused on PDA closure, as the benefit of preventive measures to reduce the incidence of PDA appears to be outweighed by the adverse effects of prophylactic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1214679\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The management of PDA in preterm infants includes three different approaches:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conservative management with supportive therapy alone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacologic closure using cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">indomethacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical ligation</p><p/><p>The support for either medical or surgical closure is based on data from studies in the 1980s and 1990s that demonstrated PDAs in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (birth weight below 1500 g) were associated with pulmonary edema, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). As a result, many preterm infants with a gestational age (GA) less than 28 weeks have received either medical or surgical therapy for PDA closure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, neonatal practice is continuously changing with a decrease in both medical and surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-preterm-infants/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The increasing use of antenatal glucocorticoid therapy, postnatal surfactant therapy, and the adoption of lower targets of oxygen saturation may have affected both the incidence and impact of a clinically significant PDA shunt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-preterm-infants/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Data are not available regarding the natural course of an untreated PDA in neonatal centers where these practices have become standard of care. In addition, there are no randomized controlled trials comparing long-term outcomes of the three different approaches. Therefore, it remains unclear which approach is most advantageous for preterm infants and whether clinical parameters or settings may favor one approach over another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-preterm-infants/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This uncertainty has led to variation in the management of PDA in preterm infants not only amongst different neonatal intensive care units (NICU), but often within a single NICU.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1529691\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It remains uncertain whether outcome of preterm infants is improved with universal echocardiographic screening versus selective echocardiographic evaluation based on the presence of clinical signs of PDA. Advocates for routine screening suggest that early detection of preclinical PDA and treatment result in better outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-preterm-infants/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Support for this approach was provided by a report from the EPIPAGE 2, a French national prospective population-based cohort study of extremely preterm infants (born at 24 to 28 weeks gestation) that found that screening for a PDA before day three of life versus no screening was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (14.2 versus 18.5 percent) and a lower risk of pulmonary hemorrhage (5.7 versus 8.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-preterm-infants/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Observed PDA with a diameter &ge;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/kg</span> was noted in 62 percent of the 847 patients who underwent echocardiographic screening, and in 59 percent of the 541 patients who were assessed by echocardiography based on clinical findings. The higher mortality in the non-screened group was primarily observed in untreated infants; however, it is not clear whether or not all of these patients had a PDA. There was no difference in the rate of NEC, severe BPD, or severe cerebral lesions between the two groups. This observational study may be limited by a possible bias as the non-screening group may have included a greater proportion of more severely affected infants because performing the evaluation was based on the presence of clinical signs of PDA.</p><p>Although these observational data do support routine screening for PDA in extremely preterm infants, the currently available evidence is insufficient to change our clinical practice of performing echocardiography based on the presence of clinical signs of PDA. Further studies, including a randomized control trial, are needed to determine the cost-benefit of universal versus selective screening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1214585\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPORTIVE THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All neonates with PDA should receive the following supportive care regardless of the approach chosen to manage their PDA:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A neutral thermal environment and adequate oxygenation that minimize demands on left ventricular (LV) function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to improve gas exchange in infants with respiratory compromise.

In a retrospective study of preterm infants below 32 weeks gestation, furosemide was associated with an increase in serum creatinine and hyponatremia, but not an increase in urine output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-preterm-infants/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

As an example, in a small prospective study of 18 preterm infants (between 24 and 32 weeks) with significant PDAs whose fluid intake was decreased from 145 to 108 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day, there were no changes in respiratory or hemodynamic parameters including fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>), blood gas values, DA diameter, left <span class=\"nowrap\">atrial/aortic</span> root ratio, and blood flow-velocities in the PDA, left pulmonary artery, and aorta. However, decreases in systemic blood pressure, blood flow in the superior vena cava, and mean blood flow-velocity in the superior mesenteric artery were observed. These results may be limited as the study duration was only 24 hours, which may have been too short of a time period to show benefit or harm.</p><p>In contrast, excessive fluid administration (greater than 170 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day) is associated with an increased incidence of PDA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-preterm-infants/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Ibuprofen has been typically given as an intravenous (IV) preparation in developed countries. However, the IV preparation is expensive and many nurseries in developing countries use oral ibuprofen for PDA closure. In a systematic review, it appears that the oral administration of ibuprofen is equally as effective as IV administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-preterm-infants/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Further trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of high-dose versus standard-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a>, and continuous infusion versus intermittent administration of intravenously administered ibuprofen.

In addition, ductal constriction and adverse effects of indomethacin do not correlate strongly with plasma concentrations. Although some studies suggest that obtaining indomethacin concentrations to adjust dosing may improve the rate of ductal closure, these measurements are not widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-preterm-infants/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. More than one dose is typically required for sustained constriction. Based on these data, indomethacin is usually given intravenously as multiple doses that range between 0.1 and 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose administered at 12- to 24-hour intervals.

However, a systematic review of five randomized controlled trials showed that a prolonged (four or more doses) administration of indomethacin compared with a short course of therapy (three or less doses) did not yield statistically significant differences in PDA closure, retreatment, re-opening, or surgical ligation rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-preterm-infants/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, prolonged therapy appeared to be associated with an increased risk of NEC (relative risk [RR] 1.87, 95% CI 1.07-3.27), but a decreased risk of renal function impairment as demonstrated by a lower proportion of infants with diminished urine output (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13-0.6) and elevated serum creatinine (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.33-0.77) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-preterm-infants/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

However, there was no reduction in mortality, the composite outcome of death or severe neurologic disability on follow-up at 18 to 36 months, BPD, or NEC. Oliguria was almost twice as likely in the indomethacin-treated infants.

Prior to the commercial availability of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">indomethacin</a> in the 1980s, surgical ligation was performed in preterm infants with PDAs who were dependent on mechanical ventilation. Once indomethacin became available, our management strategy changed to include frequent evaluations to detect PDAs using echocardiograms and to administer indomethacin therapy to all ventilator-dependent infants with PDA. A moderate approach based on initial supportive care and subsequent pharmacologic therapy to close PDAs in infants who remain dependent on mechanical ventilation is most commonly used.</p><p>As noted above, there are no data to determine the optimal management of PDA in preterm infants. As a result, there is variability in the treatment of PDAs amongst different centers, and among neonatologists at a single NICU including our own institution.

We do not routinely measure platelets prior to drug administration but do avoid COX inhibitor use in infants with coagulopathy.
