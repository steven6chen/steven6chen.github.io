DCM is characterized by dilatation and systolic dysfunction of one or both ventricles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and classification of the cardiomyopathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>DCM is classified as idiopathic (idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, or IDC) when all detectable causes have been excluded (except genetic causes). Potentially diagnosable causes of DCM include a variety of toxic, metabolic, or infectious agents (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of dilated cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>). Ischemic heart disease must also be excluded. Although specialists commonly apply the diagnosis of IDC to DCMs of unknown cause, clearly some etiology is present but not yet detected. </p><p>Family-based studies of first-degree relatives of patients with IDC have established that familial dilated cardiomyopathy (known as familial DCM, or FDC) can be identified in 20 to 35 percent of patients diagnosed with IDC by clinical screening of family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-dilated-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most familial DCM is transmitted in an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, although all inheritance patterns have been identified (autosomal recessive, X-linked, and mitochondrial). During the past 20 years, familial DCM genetic studies have identified mutations in more than 30 genes. </p><p>Most patients with genetic DCM will have an initial diagnosis of idiopathic DCM. Given the frequency of familial DCM, evaluation of new idiopathic DCM cases should include a careful three to four generation family history, clinical screening of first-degree family members as described below, and in most cases, molecular genetic testing. </p><p>This topic will discuss the diagnosis and prevalence of familial DCM and guidelines for identifying and treating familial DCM. The phenotypes and genes associated with DCM are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-dilated-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of dilated cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1363117\"><span class=\"h1\">FAMILIAL DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1363132\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although familial aggregation of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) is often unrecognized, epidemiologic studies have found a variable rate of familial disease, ranging from 20 to over 50 percent of patients initially diagnosed with IDC who are found to have family members affected with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-dilated-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/1-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-10</a>]. Hence, the estimate of the prevalence of familial DCM is inferred from the prevalence of IDC.</p><p>One oft-cited estimate of IDC prevalence was 36.5:100,000 (approximately 1:2700) from an early study conducted in Olmsted County, Minnesota, from 1975 to 1984 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-dilated-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In that study, the prevalence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was 19.7:100,000 (approximately 1:5000). Later estimates of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have placed its prevalence 10-fold higher at 1:500 individuals. Similarly, it has been argued that the prevalence of IDC may be 10-fold higher, approximately 1:250 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-dilated-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], based on several lines of evidence. This estimate is of fundamental importance when integrating the population frequencies of rare variants in genes relevant for DCM cause.</p><p>The frequency of FDC has been derived from clinical studies in which patients rigorously diagnosed with IDC have had first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) clinically screened for evidence of DCM. These studies have observed frequencies usually ranging from 20 to 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-dilated-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/1-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-10</a>]. History, physical examination, electrocardiography, and echocardiography have been the principal methods used for diagnosis. </p><p>The following observations are summarized from four studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical screening (history, exam, echocardiogram, and electrocardiogram) was conducted in a series of 59 patients identified with an idiopathic DCM and their willing family members, and 20 percent of the 59 patients had relatives that also were also diagnosed with IDC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-dilated-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detailed family histories were obtained to construct pedigrees in 445 patients who had idiopathic DCM by echocardiography and angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-dilated-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Among 970 first- and second-degree relatives, definite familial DCM was present in 11 percent and suspected familial DCM in 24 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective cohort study evaluated 767 asymptomatic first- and second-degree relatives of 189 consecutive patients with idiopathic DCM (dilated left ventricle [LV] with fractional shortening &lt;25 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-dilated-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Abnormalities were found in 23 percent of relatives: DCM was present in 4.6 percent, LV enlargement without systolic dysfunction in 15.5 percent, and decreased fractional shortening &lt;25 percent without LV enlargement in 2.7 percent. The findings in each kindred were consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were noted in a report of 408 asymptomatic relatives of 110 consecutive patients with idiopathic DCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-dilated-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Echocardiography revealed abnormalities in 29 percent, with DCM in 3 percent, LV enlargement in 20 percent, and reduced fractional shortening in 6 percent.</p><p/><p>Correlation between asymptomatic LV enlargement and histopathology was demonstrated in a study in which biopsies were obtained in 14 patients with DCM, 32 asymptomatic relatives with LV enlargement but normal systolic function, and in six control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-dilated-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The immunopathologic and histopathologic abnormalities were present in all patients with DCM, in 86 percent of asymptomatic relatives with LV enlargement, and in none of the control subjects.</p><p>Because the age of onset of DCM from genetic cause in adults varies greatly, the frequency of familial DCM is difficult to assess and may have been underestimated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-dilated-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. This is because screening genetically at-risk family members during a relative brief study period (eg, a few years) will not enable detection of disease that presents in subsequent years. Rescreening studies in initially healthy relatives of an FDC family have demonstrated this. In a report of 68 initially healthy members in a large kindred with familial DCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-dilated-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], repeat testing performed at six years showed that two individuals who were normal at initial examination had developed evidence of DCM. Two others presented with advanced heart failure (HF) and sudden death, respectively. At initial examination, both were asymptomatic, but the first patient had LV enlargement with normal contractility and the second had left bundle branch block.</p><p>A similar rate of development of new abnormalities was noted in another report of repeat testing in 238 initially healthy relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-dilated-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. At a median follow-up of 53 months, three developed DCM (1.3 percent) and 12 progressed to LV enlargement or systolic dysfunction (5.0 percent).</p><p>Progression is more common in relatives with abnormalities detected on initial screening. This was demonstrated in a study with complete follow-up (clinical evaluation, electrocardiography, and echocardiography) in 124 relatives with LV enlargement or fractional shortening &lt;25 percent and 238 initially healthy relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-dilated-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. At a median follow-up of 53 months, progression to DCM occurred in 13 of the relatives with initially abnormal findings and three of the initially healthy relatives (10.4 versus 1.3 percent). In another report, 12 of 45 asymptomatic family members with LV enlargement developed symptomatic HF over a mean follow-up of 39 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-dilated-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Clinical features of patients with familial DCM are similar to those of patients with apparently sporadic DCM. In a series of 304 patients with idiopathic DCM (125 with confirmed familial DCM, 48 with probable familial DCM, 72 with possible familial DCM, and 59 with apparent sporadic idiopathic DCM), the clinical features of probands (and affected family members of those with familial disease) were similar and were not useful to distinguish familial from sporadic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-dilated-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The median age of onset of those affected ranged from 40 to 46 years; the median duration of the DCM diagnosis ranged from five to six years, and the median time from diagnosis to transplant or death ranged from four to six years and were similar across all groups.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1363139\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF FAMILIAL DCM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with genetic DCM will have an initial diagnosis of idiopathic DCM.

This recommendation is out of date, and genetic testing is indicated in most circumstances. The HFSA guidelines are undergoing review and will be updated with this recommendation. Genetic testing should always be directed to the one most clearly affected person in a family to facilitate family screening and management. Screening the most affected individual increases the likelihood of detecting a relevant rare variant.</p><p/><p>We also agree with the recommendation in the 2011 <span class=\"nowrap\">HRS/European</span> Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) consensus statement for comprehensive testing in patients with DCM and prominent conduction system disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a family history of premature unexpected sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-dilated-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Genetic testing is indicated for familial DCM. Many cardiovascular genetics professionals recommend testing even if no other disease is evident in the family. Genetic information is useful for management of affected individuals, as well as to assess risk in relatives. Updated guidelines now in progress will provide specific recommendations for genetic testing in nonfamilial DCM.</p><p>Molecular genetic testing for DCM using large panels of genes (30 to 100 or more) driven by next generation sequencing methods is now available. From a practical standpoint, testing a panel of DCM genes has supplanted single gene or small panel testing as the standard of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-dilated-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Testing of larger numbers of genes increases the likelihood that variants of unknown significance may be encountered. This makes pre- and post-test genetic counseling and result interpretation especially important, along with clarification of the phenotype and the selection of the optimal individual from a pedigree for testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/familial-dilated-cardiomyopathy-prevalence-diagnosis-and-treatment/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p>Patients who are offered genetic testing should receive genetic counseling, including explanation of genetic disease, heritability, genetic risk, test sensitivities, and possible testing outcomes including the possibility of ambiguous or uncertain results.

(See <a href=\"#H1363132\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a new diagnosis of idiopathic DCM is made, a three to four generation family history and clinical screening of first-degree relatives is indicated. Clinical screening (history, exam, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram) has been recommended for first-degree relatives to identify asymptomatic or undetected disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic testing with appropriate genetic counseling is indicated for known familial DCM to facilitate risk assessment of family members. Genetic testing for nonfamilial but a well-established DCM diagnosis without other obvious cause is reasonable in many cases. (See <a href=\"#H1365129\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of familial disease'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The finding of a specific mutation does not generally govern therapy, although certain clinical characteristics associated with some genes may influence screening, education, and counseling of family members, and the threshold for primary prevention (eg, implantable cardiac defibrillator use) or presymptomatic therapy (eg, beta-blocker or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor administration).
