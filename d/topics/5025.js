This absence is different than other parent-child separations because, for a military child, wartime deployment can mean prolonged separation from a parent, fear for that parent's safety, and increased uncertainty in daily routine.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the developmental and behavioral implications of deployment for children and adolescents of parents in the military.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30427047\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deployment is a way of life for military families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-military-children-with-deployed-parents/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Among the 3.5 million active duty and reserve military members in 2015, 34 percent were married with children, 6.3 percent were single parents, and 2.2 percent were dual military families with children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-military-children-with-deployed-parents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In 2015, approximately 1.8 million United States children had at least one parent in the military; 62 percent had a parent in the active duty component, and 38 percent in the reserve component (National Guard or Reserve). Approximately 37 percent of children in military families were younger than 6 years, 31 percent were age 6 to 11 years, 24 percent were 12 to 18 years, and 7 percent were 19 to 22 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30427054\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION OF TERMS</span></p><p><strong>Deployment &ndash;</strong> A deployment is the short-term assignment of a military service member to a combat or noncombat zone. A deployment can last from 1 to 18 months, with typical deployments lasting 12 to 15 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-military-children-with-deployed-parents/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. Deployments can be planned or unexpected. They vary according to the service member's job description and branch of service.</p><p><strong>Active duty &ndash; </strong>The term active duty refers to military members who are serving full time in their military capacity. The active duty military consists of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard. The Army has the largest active duty force (&gt;528,000), followed by the Air Force (&gt;326,000), Navy (&gt;319,000), Marines (&gt;195,000), and Coast Guard (&gt;40,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-military-children-with-deployed-parents/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. Active duty military members and their families usually live on or near a military base and have access to military support services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-military-children-with-deployed-parents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p><strong>Selected Reserve</strong> &ndash; The<strong> </strong>Reserve (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard) and National Guard (Army and Air) are military organizations with members who generally perform a minimum of 39 days of military duty per year and who augment the active duty military when necessary. The reserve components are referred to collectively as &quot;the Selected Reserve.&quot; The composition (eg, Army, Navy, etc) of the Selected Reserve is similar to that of active duty services.</p><p>Selected Reserve members and their families often do not live on or near a military base and may have less access to the military-specific supports and services available to their active duty counterparts (eg, military pediatric health care providers and teachers in schools on or near military bases are familiar with the stresses of deployment; civilian health care providers and teachers may not be) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-military-children-with-deployed-parents/abstract/8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-13</a>]. Members of the Selected Reserve may experience stress related to the effects of unpredictable long-term deployments on their employment. In addition, changes in health insurance related to deployment may necessitate changes in health care providers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30427063\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS OF PARENTAL DEPLOYMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The body of research demonstrating the impact of recent deployments on children in military families has grown since 2001. Deployments in support of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as military deployments to other regional hot spots differ in important ways from other wartime deployments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-military-children-with-deployed-parents/abstract/7,10,11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10,11,14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deployments have been extended and repeated; some units have less than 12 months between deployments, and others deploy regularly for three to six months every year</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advancements in medical care for wounded service members have resulted in greater survival but increased physical and psychological disability</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater involvement of the Selected Reserve (whose families may have less access to support services)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased media coverage with increased intensity (ie, &quot;embedded&quot; reporters)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Debate about the legitimacy of involvement</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Technologic advances that permit increased communication</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive duration of this military operation &ndash; the longest in United States history</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30427070\"><span class=\"h2\">Emotional cycle of deployment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a military member is deployed, several adjustments happen at home: household responsibilities shift, schedules may change, and new routines are established. These changes can ebb and flow depending upon the phase of deployment.</p><p>The &quot;emotional cycle of deployment&quot; was developed as a model for understanding the phases and transitions that military families go through as part of the deployment process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82970\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef82970 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-military-children-with-deployed-parents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although this framework has not been empirically validated, it makes sense to service members and their families and clinicians working with or studying military families. In a qualitative study of focus groups of service members and spouses, the pattern of responses for both active and reserve families conformed to the emotional stage of deployment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-military-children-with-deployed-parents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The emotional cycle of deployment is divided into five distinct stages: predeployment, deployment, sustainment, redeployment, and postdeployment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Predeployment</strong> is the phase from the time of notification of deployment to the actual departure of the service member. It can be a time of psychological denial of the upcoming event, intense preparation, and anticipation of departure. In focus groups, service members report that preparing for deployment was stressful because of training requirements, personal preparation, and family preparation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-military-children-with-deployed-parents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Service members often view predeployment as an extension of deployment because of the high levels of stress for them and their family members. Preparation for deployment requires weeks of fast-paced work and time away from the family at local training sites before the actual deployment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Early deployment</strong> is the phase from the time of departure through the first one to two months of deployment. The early deployment phase can be marked by emotional distress as the family tries to regain its balance and routine. Often during this period, families choose to relocate near loved ones for the duration of the deployment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sustainment</strong> is the phase that spans from two months into deployment to one month before the service member's return. In adaptive families, a new routine is found during this time and available resources are utilized to continue the &quot;family business.&quot; Families that do not adapt to the deployment may be more likely to experience emotional and behavioral consequences of deployment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Redeployment</strong> is the phase that occurs in the month before the service member returns home. The family may feel anxious, excited, and apprehensive as they anticipate and prepare for the return of the service member.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postdeployment</strong> marks the beginning of the reintegration of the service member into the family. There may be unanticipated stresses as the family roles and routines are redefined, especially if the service member has suffered physical or psychological injury. The postdeployment period may continue for months to years, and its impact may be further compounded by additional stressors such as preparation for redeployment or relocation (also called a &quot;permanent change of station&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30427077\"><span class=\"h2\">Emotional and behavioral consequences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A parent's deployment may adversely impact a child's behavior <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mental health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-military-children-with-deployed-parents/abstract/10,13,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13,18,19</a>]. Observational studies suggest that parental deployment can be associated with externalizing problems (eg, aggressiveness, irritability) and internalizing problems (eg, crying, sadness, depression, anxiety) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-military-children-with-deployed-parents/abstract/20-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-28</a>]. However, through the adversity of a deployment, children often demonstrate increased responsibility, independence, confidence, and increased participation in decision-making compared with their peers who have not experienced deployment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-military-children-with-deployed-parents/abstract/8,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,29</a>].</p><p>In a meta-analysis of 16 observational studies (1993-2010) evaluating the effect of parental deployment on adjustment (internalizing, externalizing, and academic), there was a small association between deployment and poorer adjustment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-military-children-with-deployed-parents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The association was strongest in middle childhood and weakest during adolescence. Maladjustment was noted primarily in parent reports (versus teacher reports and youth self-reports) and in studies with civilian control groups (versus military children whose parents were not deployed or predeployment-postdeployment comparisons).</p><p>Individual studies conducted before or during Operation Desert Storm (1990-1991) noted increased sadness, tearfulness, demands for attention, and psychologic symptoms among school-aged children during parental deployment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-military-children-with-deployed-parents/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In these and other studies, the effects were mediated by the child's baseline mental health status and the at-home parent's mental health status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-and-behavioral-implications-for-military-children-with-deployed-parents/abstract/18,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,30-32</a>].
