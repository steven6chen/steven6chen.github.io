There are a few different kinds of hormonal birth control. Some contain the hormones estrogen and progestin. Others contain only progestin.</p><p>All hormonal birth control methods are very effective. The methods differ in how easy they are to use and their side effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75100\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75100 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pills</strong> &ndash; Women who take birth control pills need to take a pill every day. Skipping pills can increase the chance of getting pregnant. Birth control pill packets usually include 4 to 7 days of hormone-free pills each month. It is during these hormone-free days that women get their period. Women who prefer not to get a period can skip the hormone-free pills and take a hormone pill every day instead. This is called continuous dosing. It can be done with the patch and the vaginal ring as well. Most birth control pills contain estrogen and progestin but there is one that contains only progestin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skin patches</strong> &ndash; Women can wear a hormone patch on their upper arm, shoulder, back, or hip (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57796\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57796 \">picture 1</a>). The patch (brand name: Xulane) must be changed once a week. Normally women wear a new patch each week for 3 weeks and then leave the patch off during week 4. Week 4 is when women have their period. Skin patches for contraception contain both estrogen and progestin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vaginal rings</strong> &ndash; A woman can put a bendable ring in her vagina that can stay in place for 3 weeks at a time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73663\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73663 \">picture 2</a>). This ring (brand name: NuvaRing) releases hormones in the vagina. It should not be removed when the woman has sex. She should check before and after sex to make sure the ring is in place.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the ring is removed or falls out, it can stay out for up to 3 hours. Normally women use the ring for 3 weeks and then go without a ring during week 4. Week 4 is when women have their period. Vaginal rings for contraception contain both estrogen and progestin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Injections</strong> &ndash; Women who use hormone injections get a shot in the arm or butt every 3 months. Injections for birth control (brand name: Depo-Provera) contain only progestin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Implants</strong> &ndash; A birth control implant is a tiny rod that releases hormones in the arm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F88379\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88379 \">picture 3</a>). It must be implanted by a doctor or nurse and can stay in the arm for up to 3 years. Implants for birth control (brand name: Nexplanon) contain only progestin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hormone-releasing IUD</strong> &ndash; IUD stands for &quot;intrauterine device.&quot; This is a device that is placed inside the uterus to prevent pregnancy. Some IUDs work by releasing hormones into the body. One is called Skyla, and it can stay in place for up to 3 years. The others are called Mirena or Liletta, and they can stay in place for up to 5 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74378\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74378 \">picture 4</a>). The hormone-releasing IUDs contain only progestin.</p><p/><p>Hormonal birth control is a safe and reliable way to prevent pregnancy for most women. But it does not protect women from infections that spread through sex (called &quot;sexually transmitted infections&quot; or &quot;sexually transmitted diseases&quot;).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10509332\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I choose the right hormonal birth control for me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Work with your doctor or nurse to choose the best option for you. As you think about your decision, think about how likely you are to use each method the right way. Can you remember to take a pill every day? Can you remember to change a patch once a week? Long-acting methods (IUD, implant) are the most convenient because they work for 3 to 5 years, depending on the method. The injection, which works for 3 months, is more convenient than the pill, patch, or ring. Also, ask your doctor how the method you are thinking about will affect your period. See the table for a list of side effects and risks for each of the different forms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75100\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75100 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10509364\"><span class=\"h1\">Is hormonal birth control safe for all women?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. Some women should not use estrogen-containing hormonal birth control. This includes women who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are age 35 or older and smoke cigarettes &ndash; These women are at increased risk for heart attacks and strokes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are pregnant</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have had blood clots or a stroke in the past</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are being treated for breast cancer, or have had breast cancer before</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have irregular or very heavy periods &ndash; Women with this problem should have it checked out before starting hormonal birth control.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have some types of liver disease &ndash; Hormonal birth control can make some types of liver disease worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have some types of heart disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get the type of migraine headaches that cause vision problems (flashing or zigzag lights)</p><p/><p>Women who have high blood pressure can use hormonal birth control, but their blood pressure needs to be followed closely by a doctor.</p><p>Many women who can't take estrogen-containing hormonal birth control can take other kinds of hormonal birth control that contain only progestin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10509379\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I take medicines besides birth control?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some medicines can affect how well hormonal birth control works. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some medicines used to prevent seizures (called &quot;anticonvulsants&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some antibiotics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>St. John's Wort (an herbal medicine for depression)</p><p/><p>If you take any of these medicines, talk to your doctor about how to handle birth control. Also, if you already take hormonal birth control, mention it to any doctor or nurse who might be prescribing medicines for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10509394\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I forget to use my hormonal birth control?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have sex and have forgotten to use your birth control, you can take a &quot;morning after&quot; pill to reduce the risk of pregnancy. Do this as soon as possible after sex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10509409\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-birth-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Choosing birth control (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-contraception-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Emergency contraception (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasectomy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vasectomy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-acting-methods-of-birth-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Long-acting methods of birth control (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-devices-iud-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Intrauterine devices (IUD) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-control-which-method-is-right-for-me-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Birth control; which method is right for me?
