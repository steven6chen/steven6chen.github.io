VKC and AKC are chronic, bilateral, and severe forms of allergic inflammation affecting the ocular surface. These two relatively uncommon types of allergic eye disease can cause severe damage to the ocular surface, leading to corneal scarring and vision loss if not treated properly (this occurs more commonly with AKC than VKC). Type I hypersensitivity reactions are important in these diseases, although they are not the only pathophysiologic mechanism. VKC is reviewed in this topic. AKC is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atopic-keratoconjunctivitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atopic keratoconjunctivitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>GPC is an inflammatory disorder that represents a reaction to lid movement over a foreign substance, such as hard contact lenses. Toxic conjunctivitis is not allergic in nature, but it is frequently confused with allergic ocular disease. It develops with protracted use of topical medications, mostly due to preservatives. GPC and toxic conjunctivitis are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=giant-papillary-conjunctivitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Giant papillary conjunctivitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxic-conjunctivitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxic conjunctivitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis, the most common forms of ocular allergy, are also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-conjunctivitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic conjunctivitis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VKC most commonly occurs in boys living in warm, dry, subtropical climates, such as the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Central and West Africa, South America, and Asian countries, such as Japan, Thailand, and India [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The limbal form of VKC is seen most often in dark-skinned individuals from Africa and India. VKC is generally rare in cooler climates, such as Northern Europe and the temperate areas of North America. In the past, prevalence in these regions has been approximately 0.03 percent of the population. As an example, prevalence for Western Europe was 3.2 in 10,000, whereas a higher prevalence ranging from 2.4 to 27.8 in 10,000 was seen in Italy, a country with a Mediterranean climate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, the prevalence in cooler regions has increased, probably due to immigration of individuals from susceptible populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Males are more commonly affected than females. In one series, the male-to-female ratio was 3.2:1 in patients &lt;20 years of age but was nearly equal in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Age at onset is generally before 10 years, with the earliest reported onset at five months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], although VKC can infrequently occur in adults. Patients usually &quot;outgrow&quot; the disease with the onset of puberty.</p><p>VKC is associated with other atopic manifestations in approximately one-half of patients; however, atopy is not necessarily related to the underlying pathogenesis of this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. The most common concomitant atopic diseases are asthma and allergic rhinitis. Aeroallergen sensitization, by skin prick testing or allergen-specific immunoassay, was reported in over 50 percent of patients in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A family history of atopy was also reported in approximately one-half of patients in two studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]. In another study, atopy was more common in patients with the palpebral or tarsal form of the disease compared with the limbal form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. VKC was associated with a family history of other inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis and thyroiditis, in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact pathogenic mechanisms of VKC are not fully elucidated. Classic immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity and T helper cell type 2 (Th2)-mediated responses are thought to play a major role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/6,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9-11</a>], but other mechanisms may be involved, including immunoglobulin G (IgG)-mediated responses, basophil hypersensitivity, and cellular delayed-typed hypersensitivity.</p><p>Evidence supporting an atopic origin for VKC includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seasonal incidence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased number of eosinophils and mast cells in conjunctival specimens</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High levels of IgE in serum and tears</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased levels of mediators derived from mast cells and eosinophils, including histamine and tryptase, in tears</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapeutic response to mast cell stabilizers</p><p/><p>Conjunctival accumulation of Th2 CD4+ cells may give rise to hyperreactivity against substances that commonly contact the conjunctiva. Offending allergens include pollens, dust mites, molds, and animal epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/8,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12,13</a>]. Nonspecific stimuli, such as wind, sunlight, and heat, also probably play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>Mast cells play a key role in the development of IgE-mediated reactions. In addition, they release inflammatory mediators (eg, histamine, interleukins) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>] that stimulate fibroblast activity and production of collagens I and III, resulting in the typical formation of giant papillae in VKC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Furthermore, there is increased expression of histamine receptors (H<sub>1</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>4</sub> receptors) in conjunctival tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The necessary vascular supply of the forming giant papillae is provided by capillary proliferation. Chronic conjunctival inflammation in VKC is associated with increased staining via immunohistochemistry for mediators that may stimulate vascular proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Histologic analysis of ocular tissue reveals proliferative changes in the epithelium, hyperplasia of connective tissue, and cellular infiltration of the substantia propria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/4,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,19</a>]. The inflammatory infiltrate includes eosinophils, neutrophils, basophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, mast cells, and fibroblasts. Conjunctival scrapings of VKC patients show a predominance of eosinophils, while basophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes are rare. Increased numbers of mast cells, eosinophils, and lymphocytes are seen in conjunctival biopsies. Cytologic examination of mucus secretions reveals a predominance of eosinophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3512395025\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost all patients with VKC note ocular pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p>Other symptoms of VKC include (in approximate order of frequency from high to low, although the frequency of each is highly variable):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Photophobia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thick mucus discharge</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tearing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foreign body sensation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blurred vision</p><p/><p>VKC is named as such because severe symptoms most commonly occur in the spring (hence &quot;vernal&quot;), at least in the first few years of the disease. In one series of 195 patients in Italy, over three-quarters of patients had seasonal symptoms that began in <span class=\"nowrap\">March/April</span> and resolved in September [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Upper tarsal papillae are discrete, enlarged (&gt;1 mm), and give rise to a classic &quot;cobblestone&quot; appearance with flattened tops (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76654\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76654 \">picture 2</a>). Subepithelial fibrosis resulting from papillae hypertrophy can cause increased eyelid thickening and ptosis. Thick, ropy mucus secretions are usually present and associated with tarsal papillae. The skin or lid margins are rarely involved, and the cornea is also typically not involved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The limbal form involves the limbus of the eye, the thin border between the cornea and the sclera. Gelatinous, confluent, yellow-gray infiltrates (Horner-Trantas dots) are pathognomonic of the limbal form of the disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F53133\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53133 \">picture 3</a>). Punctate collections of epithelial cells, eosinophils, and calcified corneal concretions may also be observed. Other corneal signs, which may also be sight threatening, include superficial peripheral neovascularization, punctate corneal epitheliopathy, shield ulcers, subepithelial scarring, and plaque formation secondary to accumulation of inflammatory debris. Shield ulcers are usually found in the upper half of the visual axis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F64926\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64926 \">picture 4</a>). After resolution, the ulcerated area leaves a ring-like scar.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no established diagnostic criteria for VKC. The diagnosis of VKC is based upon the typical epidemiology and clinical features of VKC (eg, young boys living in warm climates who present with ocular pruritus and giant papillae on the conjunctival lining of the upper eyelid). A clinical grading system was proposed to aid in the diagnosis and management of VKC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F113816\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113816 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Signs'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main disease to consider in the differential diagnosis is atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC). However, in contrast to VKC, AKC is perennial from the outset, affects predominantly the lower tarsus (eyelid), and commonly presents with vision-threatening corneal scars and neovascularization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapy for VKC is long term and requires frequent follow-up. The management approach includes both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F114080\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114080 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers are first-line pharmacologic therapies. Treatment with topical corticosteroids is best undertaken by an ophthalmologist. Patients who do not respond to these therapies may benefit from an allergy evaluation and possibly allergen immunotherapy. Additional medications that may be effective in some patients include calcineurin inhibitors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and oral antihistamines.</p><p>A proposed grading system may aid in choice of treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F113816\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113816 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Treatment of underlying conditions, such as blepharitis, is also necessary for successful management of VKC.

These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of nonspecific triggers, such as wind, heat, salt water, and sunlight whenever possible</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of exposure to known aeroallergens in patients with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated disease (this can be challenging as patients with VKC can react to multiple aeroallergens)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of eye rubbing as it leads to a mechanical mast-cell degranulation, as well as exacerbation of the allergic process</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Artificial tears</a>, especially in patients who develop tear film insufficiency due to the anticholinergic effect of systemic antihistamines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cool compresses</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial topical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical dual-acting mast cell stabilizers and antihistamines are typically chosen as first-line therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F114080\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114080 \">algorithm 1</a>) and should be used on a daily basis throughout the affected season (usually just the spring, but symptoms may extend into other seasons depending upon levels of pollen allergens and may occur nearly year round). If a dual-acting agent is not an option, alternatives are a combination of a separate topical mast cell stabilizer and a topical antihistamine or a mast cell stabilizer alone. However, the dual agents were more effective than mast cell stabilizers alone in studies using a conjunctival allergen challenge model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/28-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-33</a>]. Topical antihistamines alone are minimally effective for VKC and are not used as monotherapy.</p><p>Dual-acting agents have two main actions. As mast cell stabilizers, they inhibit mast cell degranulation, which is the first step in the allergic cascade. They also inhibit leukocyte activity and dampen mediator release from mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils. As antihistamines, they competitively and reversibly block histamine receptors in the conjunctiva and eyelids, thereby blocking the actions of the primary mast cell-derived mediator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This also helps reduce the late phase of the allergic response.</p><p>Dual-acting agents include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olopatadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olopatadine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azelastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azelastine</a> hydrochloride, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinastine</a>, pemirolast potassium, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketotifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketotifen</a> fumarate (this last option is available in a generic formulation and is over the counter in the United States). These drugs have been studied extensively in seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. However, there are only a few nonrandomized studies on use of these drugs, specifically olopatadine and ketotifen, in patients with VKC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/33,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,38</a>]. Common side effects of these medications include stinging upon instillation and headache. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-conjunctivitis-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic conjunctivitis: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one observational study, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olopatadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olopatadine</a> hydrochloride 0.1% significantly decreased most signs and symptoms of VKC, including itching, tearing, burning, mucus discharge, conjunctival hyperemia, and corneal involvement after two months of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, photophobia and limbal papillae did not improve significantly. In another observational study, patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketotifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketotifen</a> had greater improvement in itching, tearing, conjunctival hyperemia, mucus discharge, and photophobia after three weeks of therapy than patients treated with olopatadine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Topical mast cell stabilizers include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cromolyn</a> sodium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nedocromil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nedocromil</a> sodium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>], and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lodoxamide-tromethamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lodoxamide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Mast cell stabilizers have repeatedly been shown to be effective in patients with VKC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-43</a>]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of these agents showed that all resulted in significant improvement in signs and symptoms of VKC, with the exception of photophobia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Comparison of the efficacy of the different drugs was not possible due to variability in the study designs. Mast cell stabilizers have no effect on mediators once they are released but are effective in preventing mast cell degranulation. The onset of action of these drugs is 5 to 14 days after initiation of therapy. Thus, these drugs are <strong>not</strong> useful for acute symptoms. In addition, dosing of mast cell stabilizers is three to four times daily compared with twice daily for most agents with combined actions. These features may limit patient compliance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3435921113\"><span class=\"h2\">Add-on initial therapy for moderate to severe disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no widely accepted grading scheme for VKC. In general, the condition is considered severe when it affects vision or leads to symptoms of itch and irritation most of the time. Patients with mild to moderate disease have intermittent symptoms (more frequent in the moderate group but not nearly continuous as with severe disease) and no visual deficits. Oral antihistamines, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fexofenadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fexofenadine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loratadine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desloratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desloratadine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levocetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levocetirizine</a>, have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis but have not been well studied in patients with VKC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. These agents have a slower onset of action compared with topical agents (one-half to two hours rather than a few minutes). In our experience, oral antihistamines may be useful as add-on therapy in patients with moderate to severe disease. Maximizing the dose of nonsedating antihistamine will often improve efficacy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-conjunctivitis-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic conjunctivitis: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Oral antihistamine use may be associated with drying of mucosal membranes and decreased tear production in some patients, especially those with concomitant dry eye. This side effect can usually be countered with the liberal application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cetirizine</a> causes sedation in a subset of patients, despite its categorization as nonsedating.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3333240996\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of refractory disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We refer patients who do not respond to two or three weeks of initial therapy (first confirming consistent use) to an ophthalmologist for topical corticosteroid therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F114080\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114080 \">algorithm 1</a>). However, a topical calcineurin inhibitor such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> is recommended rather than topical corticosteroids if the corneal epithelium is compromised, particularly in the presence of shield ulcers. Several classes of medications may need to be used concurrently. Starting one does not mean others have to be terminated. In general, we recommend starting, stopping, and tapering medication based upon the patient's symptoms. If control is not obtained after two to three weeks of topical corticosteroid therapy, we refer to an allergy specialist for possible allergen immunotherapy (VKC is unlikely if testing to aeroallergens is negative, and the patient should be evaluated for other causes of conjunctivitis). For patients who have trouble controlling symptoms when topical corticosteroids are reduced, we add topical calcineurin inhibitors as steroid-sparing agents. Most patients have adequate control with these measures over time, but a small percentage require systemic immunosuppressive therapy (eg, cyclosporine).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A short-term, high-dose pulse regimen of topical corticosteroids is often necessary in patients with VKC who fail to respond to two to three weeks of a dual-acting <span class=\"nowrap\">antihistamine/mast</span> cell stabilizer, particularly those with significant seasonal exacerbations. Close follow-up with an ophthalmologist is required due to vision-threatening side effects of topical corticosteroids, such as glaucoma, cataracts, and secondary infections.

In less severe cases, pulse therapy with topical &quot;soft&quot; steroids on a two to four times per day basis for approximately two weeks is effective in gaining control of the allergic response so that mast cell stabilizers, antihistamines, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a> have a greater chance to work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/40,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,47</a>].

By comparison, &quot;soft&quot; steroids are a group of topical corticosteroids that have a greatly reduced risk of causing increased IOP because they bind with high affinity to the glucocorticoid receptor and the unbound drug undergoes rapid inactivation upon penetration of the cornea.

An important advantage of the topical calcineurin inhibitors is that they do not cause the same side effects typically seen with topical corticosteroids, such as an increase in IOP. Thus, long-term use of these agents is considered safe when used topically, unlike chronic use of topical corticosteroids, and only minimal amounts can be traced systemically. However, topical cyclosporine and tacrolimus are generally not chosen over topical corticosteroids for acute exacerbations, because of their much slower onset of action (weeks to a couple of months rather than hours to days). We suggest using topical cyclosporine 2% one drop each eye twice daily (can be increased to four times daily in severe cases) as a corticosteroid-sparing agent in patients with moderate to severe disease who require frequent or prolonged courses of topical corticosteroids. Systemic cyclosporine is reserved for corticosteroid-dependent patients who do not respond to other therapies.

However, no randomized trial has been performed evaluating the utility of systemic cyclosporine in the treatment of ocular allergy. Systemic cyclosporine is generally limited to patients with severe atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) who do not respond adequately to topical therapy; it would be extremely rare to use this therapeutic approach in VKC. If administered, oral dosing is 2.5 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day during the affected season. The patient must be closely monitored for any adverse effects including kidney dysfunction, bone marrow suppression, hypertension, tremor, hirsutism, and gingival hyperplasia. Systemic cyclosporine is rarely, if ever, needed in VKC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3078223663\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment for subsequent seasons</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with known disease, a dual-acting agent should be started approximately a month before the usual onset of their seasonal symptoms and continued for the duration of season. Dual-acting agents have a quick onset of action, but the start of the season can vary from year to year and allergic responses, once activated, can last up to two months. Thus, it is better to start treatment a bit early to ensure that the mast cells are stabilized before the onset of the season. While mast cell stabilizers have a slower onset of action than dual-acting agents, starting one of these drugs a month before the usual onset of symptoms is usually sufficient. Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, while effective, is typically not used as initial therapy for subsequent seasons, because it would need to be started even further in advance of the season due to its very slow onset of action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. The approach for patients who fail to respond to initial therapy in subsequent seasons is similar to that outlined above. Patients who are asymptomatic on just a dual-acting agent or mast cell stabilizer for a season can do a trial without therapy the following season to determine if the disease has resolved.

Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> is used rather than topical corticosteroids if the corneal epithelium is compromised, particularly in the presence of shield ulcers, because topical corticosteroids have been shown to interfere with re-epithelialization. Additional therapy for sterile corneal ulcers includes debridement of inflammatory debris and the use of wide-spectrum antibiotics, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moxifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">moxifloxacin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gatifloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gatifloxacin</a> four times per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vernal-keratoconjunctivitis/abstract/62-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-65</a>].
