The duration and density of the block depends upon the dose, concentration, and pharmacology of the chosen local anesthetic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-peripheral-nerve-blocks#H184102507\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of peripheral nerve blocks&quot;, section on 'Single injection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4190925908\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pudendal block is typically used to alleviate pain from minor surgical procedures involving the perineum and from events related to delivery, such as introital distension during the second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery, or perineal repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Of note, pudendal nerve block does not decrease the pain associated with uterine contractions and cervical dilatation in the first stage of labor. Before the widespread adoption of epidural analgesia in obstetrics, pudendal block was the preferred analgesic technique for the second stage of delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is still sometimes used when there are contraindications to neuraxial anesthesia and an anesthetic is needed for a low vaginal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> posterior perineal procedure. Additionally, at least one study has reported successful use of pudendal nerve block for the placement of McDonald cerclage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For women with suspected pudendal neuralgia, pudendal block has been proposed for both diagnosis and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic management of pain during labor and delivery&quot;, section on 'Pudendal nerve block'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=operative-vaginal-delivery#H3761695478\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Operative vaginal delivery&quot;, section on 'Anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-injury-associated-with-pelvic-surgery#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nerve injury associated with pelvic surgery&quot;, section on 'Pudendal nerve'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paracervical block is most commonly used to provide analgesia during gynecological procedures involving cervical dilation or manipulation. Typical applications include pregnancy termination, hysteroscopy, and cervical ablation or excision. Analgesia by paracervical block is generally unsatisfactory for control of pain during intrauterine procedures in conscious women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Paracervical block provides some relief from the pain of uterine contractions and cervical dilation during the active phase of labor and was a relatively common labor anesthetic prior to 1970 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It is no longer used in the United States, in part because of concerns about post-block fetal bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].

The nerve crosses posterior to the sacrospinous ligament in close approximation to where the ligament attaches to the ischial spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Infiltration of a local anesthetic around the trunk of the pudendal nerve at the level of the ischial spine results in analgesia of these areas (lower vagina, posterior perineum and vulva).</p><p>Of note, pudendal nerve block does not abolish sensation to the anterior part of the perineum because this region is supplied by branches of the ilioinguinal and genitofemoral nerves. In addition, pudendal block does not impact the cervix or upper vagina and is ineffective for pain relief associated with uterine manipulation (eg, manual extraction of placenta) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Materials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following items are obtained:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sterile gloves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prepackaged kits for pudendal block including a disposable plastic needle guide and a needle.

Of note, the toxic dose of lidocaine (3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> without epinephrine and 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> with epinephrine) is determined prior to injection. While in two studies the addition of dilute epinephrine (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> increased the block's intensity and duration, the authors also reported an increased need for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> augmentation or vacuum extraction when epinephrine was used in pudendal block at delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

Prior to performing the procedure, the risks and benefits are reviewed with the patient and informed consent is obtained. To prepare for the nerve block, the patient is placed in the lithotomy position (for both obstetric and gynecologic patients) and the perineum and vagina are swabbed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=povidone-iodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">povidone iodine</a> or a low alcohol (4 percent) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> solution (based on patient allergies and clinician preference). The anesthetic is drawn into the syringe with the 18- or 20- gauge needle and then the initial needle is replaced with the spinal needle.</p><p>Typically, the block is bilateral. For limited procedures strictly confined to a single side of the vagina or perineum, the block may be unilateral and is performed on the same side as the planned procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4205118746\"><span class=\"h3\">Transvaginal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The transvaginal approach is described below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First, the ischial spines are located by palpating the posterolateral vaginal sidewall and identifying the bony protrusions that are distinct from the rest of the pelvic sidewall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F87086\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87086 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F87092\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87092 \">figure 3</a>). If the examiner cannot identify the ischial spines, an alternate approach is to palpate the firm band of the sacrospinous ligament and follow it laterally from the sacrum to the ischial spine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Next, the clinician introduces the needle guide. To perform a block on the patient's right side, the operator's right index and middle fingers are used to palpate the right ischial spine and direct the needle guide into place. The maneuver is reversed for the contralateral side.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the needle guide is in place, the guide is positioned to lie against the vaginal mucosa on the sacrospinous ligament, about 1 cm medial and inferior to the ischial spine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57711\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57711 \">figure 1</a>). When the needle guide is properly positioned, the needle and syringe are introduced into the guide and the needle is advanced to and then through the vaginal mucosa into the sacrospinous ligament, a distance of approximately 1 cm. After aspirating to confirm the absence of an intravascular location, 3 mL of local anesthetic are injected into the ligament.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lastly, the needle is advanced slightly until the sensation of resistance caused by the ligament is lost. The needle should now be lodged in the loose areolar tissue behind the ligament where the pudendal nerve is located. Aspiration is again performed to confirm the absence of an intravascular position (the pudendal and inferior gluteal vessels lie adjacent to the pudendal nerve), and then the remaining 7 mL of anesthetic are injected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To achieve a bilateral block, the procedure is repeated on the contralateral side.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4282201552\"><span class=\"h3\">Transperineal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is placed in lithotomy position.&nbsp;After appropriate skin preparation, the ischial spine is identified by inserting the left index finger through the vagina or rectum and directly palpating the spine. A 20 cm 20-gauge needle will be guided to this point transcutaneously. The vaginal route for the guiding finger may be blocked by descent of the presenting part, which is really the primary indication for the transperineal approach. The skin entry point lies 2.5 cm posteromedial to the ischial tuberosity (identified by palpation), overlying the ischiorectal fossa. The needle is introduced at right angle to the skin and is advanced lateral to the guiding finger, at all times within the ischiorectal fossa.&nbsp;The syringe is not attached until the needle has reached its final position, about 1 cm caudal to the ischial spine along the sacrospinous ligament. The remainder of the steps are as described for the vaginal approach. The same procedure is carried out on the other side. Whether the same guiding finger is used or not will depend on the preference of the operator.</p><p>The transperineal approach is less efficacious than the transvaginal approach and therefore much less used. It has been reported that the bilateral success rate for pudendal blockade is approximately 50 percent with the use of the transvaginal route and only 25 percent with the transperineal route [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcome and efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Within four to five minutes of the injection, a successful block will allow the clinician to pinch the lower vagina and posterior vulva, first with the thumb and index finger, and then with an Allis clamp, without provoking pain. Maximum anesthesia is achieved after 10 to 20 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]; the most common cause of block failure is not allowing enough time for the anesthetic to take effect. If the block is effective on only one side, an additional 5 mL of anesthetic may be injected into the under-anesthetized side. The total injected dose is not to exceed 30 mL (300 mg) total of 1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>. Ideally, the total dose should not be more than 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. The average duration of lidocaine-induced pudendal block is 30 to 60 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>While pudendal block provides satisfactory analgesia in many cases, studies have reported that 10 to 50 percent of bilateral pudendal blocks are ineffective on one or both sides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. This wide variation may reflect lack of provider education and training, as reported in at least one study, rather than failure of the procedure itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As noted above, the pudendal block does not provide pain relief for the anterior perineum, upper vagina, and cervix. Subcutaneous infiltration with additional medication is typically needed to repair lacerations in these areas and is not evidence of block failure. In a trial comparing single-shot spinal anesthesia with pudendal block in laboring women at &ge;7 cm of dilation, general pain relief was better with the single-shot spinal anesthetic (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>), although the two techniques appeared equivalent for episiotomy repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Pudendal block does not interfere with uterine contractions and has no adverse effects on labor progress or maternal or fetal well-being, although it may make the second stage of delivery more challenging with loss of the bearing-down reflex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/11,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,18</a>]. Although local anesthetics cross the placenta, pudendal block is not associated with immediate neonatal neurobehavioral effects, regardless of the agent used, even when given up to 16 minutes before delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential complications are rare and include, in descending order of frequency:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematoma &ndash; Hematoma formation from perforation of a blood vessel during needle insertion.

Risks include the cardio-stimulatory effects of epinephrine, which may limit its utility in patients who are hypertensive, prone to cardiac tachyarrhythmias, or in whom tachycardia is not well-tolerated.

Ester-type anesthetics (2-chloroprocaine) are metabolized by serum cholinesterase and have shorter half-lives than the amide-type anesthetics (lidocaine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>), which are metabolized by the liver. Some clinicians prefer an ester-type anesthetic for paracervical block because only small amounts of non-metabolized drug reach the fetus due to rapid hydroxylation in maternal plasma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The theoretical disadvantage of this approach would be the relatively short duration of maternal analgesia.

The anesthetic solution is drawn into the syringe with the short needle, which is then replaced with the spinal needle. The patient is placed in the lithotomy position.

A vaginal speculum and tenaculum are used for optimal exposure.</p><p>The two common techniques for paracervical block are to inject local anesthetic into the cervicovaginal junction in either a four-point (at 2, 4, 8, and 10 o'clock) or two-point (at 4 and 8 o'clock only) fashion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64237\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64237 \">figure 5</a>). In a non-inferiority trial comparing pain scores after the four- and two-point techniques in women undergoing first trimester surgical abortion, the pain scores were similar for the two approaches but non-inferiority could not be confirmed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The author prefers the two-point technique because it minimizes the number of painful injections for the patient and appears to have similar efficacy compared with the four-point technique. Regardless of number of injection sites, a total dose of 10 to 20 mL of anesthetic agent (usually 1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> or 2 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroprocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroprocaine</a>) is injected approximately 10 mm into the cervical stroma at the cervicovaginal junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/6,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,34</a>]. Within 10 to 15 minutes, a dose of 10 mL of 1 percent lidocaine (100 mg lidocaine) achieves a peak plasma level well below the toxic range for most adult women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

In the above non-inferiority trial, a second arm compared a three-minute wait time with no wait-time in women who received a four-point paracervical block prior to first trimester surgical abortion and reported a non-significant difference between pain scores, although non-inferiority could not be confirmed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Efficacy of paracervical block has been debated in part because of the numerous medication and procedure combinations as well the limited ability to measure pain as an endpoint (eg, visual analog scales or use of ancillary medication). In small trials comparing paracervical block with other agents or placebo for first-trimester suction termination of pregnancy, paracervical block appears superior to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/25,26,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26,36</a>]. However, a 2013 systematic review of 26 randomly assigned or controlled trials assessing the efficacy of paracervical local anesthesia for a variety of procedures (involving both cervical dilation and uterine intervention) compared with placebo or other interventions reported mixed findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Severe complications from paracervical block are rare and are mainly related to high doses of local anesthetic or intravascular injection (ie, local anesthetic systemic toxicity, or LAST). Symptoms can range from drowsiness and ringing in the ears to confusion, seizure, coma, and ventricular arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Symptoms, risk factors, and management are presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F107887\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107887 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Vasovagal syncope (or &quot;cervical shock&quot;) may occur in women who have pain during the gynecological procedure, despite administration of a paracervical block. These episodes can be differentiated from seizure activity related to inadvertent intravascular injection because they are accompanied by bradycardia, are short and self-limited, and lack a postictal state. Treatment includes Trendelenburg position and intravenous fluid. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Atropine</a> (0.5 mg) can be used to treat such patients, but is rarely necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104771050\"><span class=\"h2\">Women in labor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If alternative pain management options are not available, a paracervical block can be used to reduce the pain associated with cervical dilation during the active phase of labor. The procedure is not effective for pain relief during the second stage because sensory nerves from the perineum are not blocked. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-management-of-pain-during-labor-and-delivery#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic management of pain during labor and delivery&quot;, section on 'Labor analgesia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104771088\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In order to avoid overdosing and possible cumulative effect of repeat administrations, especially with amide-type anesthetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], paracervical block is administered only during active labor, when cervical dilatation is between 4 cm and 8 cm, and at intervals of not less than one hour. After 8 cm dilatation, the procedure is more difficult to perform, is less effective, and has a higher risk of inducing fetal bradycardia, and is therefore not advised. Prior to performing the procedure, the risks and benefits are reviewed and informed consent is obtained. The parturient is placed in the lithotomy position. The author performs a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=povidone-iodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">povidone iodine</a> or a low alcohol <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> solution prep; selection is based upon patient allergy profile and clinician preference.</p><p>To perform the procedure, the clinician's right hand is used to position the needle guide when injecting the maternal right side. Two fingers interposed between the cervix (or fetal head) and the needle guide are used to direct the tip of the guide into the lateral vaginal fornix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51171\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51171 \">figure 6</a>). The direction of the needle should be slightly lateral to the cervix and fetal head to avoid puncturing the fetus, especially when a needle spacer is not available. When the needle guide is properly positioned, the needle is inserted through the guide, taking care not to extend more than 5 mm beyond the tip of the guide. Several experts recommend an injection depth of no more than 3 mm to decrease the risk of complications, such as fetal bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/9,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,41,42</a>]. The syringe containing 10 mL of anesthetic is attached to the needle and, if no blood is aspirated, 5 mL of anesthetic is injected slowly into the vaginal submucosa, between contractions. After the injection has been completed, the mother is turned onto her side to maximize uteroplacental blood flow and the fetus is monitored for three minutes to assess for fetal bradycardia. Assuming the mother and fetus are stable, the same procedure is then performed on the left side, but the clinician's left hand is used for positioning the needle guide.</p><p>We believe it is safer to inject the anesthetic at 4 and 8 o'clock, rather than at 3 and 9 o'clock, because the latter sites are more vascular. A four-site injection technique (3, 5, 7, and 9 o'clock) has also been proposed to allow for anatomic variation in the distribution of nerve bundles; however, this is unlikely to be clinically important since the anesthetic spreads rapidly into the entire area at the base of the broad ligament. Anesthetic injection directly into the cervix is not advisable, given it is only partially effective (it may block pain associated with dilatation, but not the painful stimuli from the contracting uterus).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104771106\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcome and efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of analgesia is rapid (two to five minutes). The duration depends upon the specific local anesthetic used; the block can be repeated during labor, but at an interval of not less than one hour. Incomplete relief of pain after paracervical block is not surprising since Frankenh&auml;user's plexus does not contain all of the sensory innervation of the uterus. (See <a href=\"#H3314357842\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy of pelvic plexus'</a> above.)</p><p>In a 2012 meta-analysis of trials assessing local anesthetic nerve blocks for pain relief in labor, paracervical block was more effective than placebo (risk ratio 32.31, 95% CI 10.60-98.54, one trial, 198 participants) and opioid treatment (risk ratio 2.52, 95% CI 1.65-3.83, one trial, 109 participants) in relieving labor pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, paracervical block was also associated with more side effects compared with placebo, including transient fetal bradycardia (risks ratio 29.0, 95% CI 1.75 to 479.61, one trial, 200 participants). While paracervical block for labor pain appeared to be efficacious, the authors agreed that the trials included were of unclear quality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104771112\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-block fetal bradycardia &ndash; Post-block fetal bradycardia typically occurs 2 to 10 minutes after infiltration. It is usually transient, but can last as long as 40 minutes. In studies published after 1975, all affected fetuses recovered and were delivered vaginally without signs of asphyxia; however, there are older reports of fetal acidemia, low Apgar scores, and fetal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In 2005, a prospective study from Finland involving 440 women reported a 3.2 percent incidence of transient fetal bradycardia lasting two to eight minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Similar rates of fetal bradycardia have been reported when epidural analgesia was administered during labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]; however, neonatal outcome is for the most part reassuring following epidural analgesia. The mechanism of post-block fetal bradycardia is unclear; several theories have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pudendal-and-paracervical-block/abstract/31,46-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,46-50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal systemic toxicity after intravascular<strong> </strong>administration &ndash; Intravascular injection of the local anesthetic may cause excessive sedation, generalized convulsions, and cardiovascular collapse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F107887\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107887 \">table 2</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H633221336\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pudendal block is typically used to alleviate pain from minor surgical procedures involving the perineum and from events related to delivery. Paracervical block is most commonly used to provide analgesia during gynecological procedures involving cervical dilation or manipulation. Although paracervical block provides some relief from labor pain, it is no longer commonly used for labor analgesia as more effective and safer options are often available. (See <a href=\"#H4190925908\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pudendal block, either a transvaginal or transperineal approach to the ischial spine can be used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F87086\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87086 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F87092\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87092 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57711\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57711 \">figure 1</a>). The transvaginal approach is almost always employed, except for laboring women in whom the fetal head has descended so far that the clinician cannot access the ischial spines.

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Outcome and efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Complications, although uncommon, include hematoma formation, infection, nerve injury, and maternal and fetal drug toxicity.

The author prefers the two-point technique because it minimizes the number of painful injections for the patient and appears to have similar efficacy compared with the 4-point technique. Regardless of number of injection sites, a total dose of 10 to 20 mL of anesthetic agent (usually 1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> or 2 percent-chloroprocaine) is injected approximately 10 mm into the cervical stroma at the cervicovaginal junction.

After 8 cm dilatation, the procedure is more difficult to perform, is less effective, and has a higher risk of inducing fetal bradycardia, and is therefore not advised. After the injection has been completed, the mother is turned onto her side to maximize uteroplacental blood flow and the fetus is monitored for three minutes to assess for fetal bradycardia. Post-block fetal bradycardia occurs following approximately 3 percent of injections.
