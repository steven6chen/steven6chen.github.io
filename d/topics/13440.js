Although initially described in 1849 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], it was not recognized as a distinct clinical entity until the 1930s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Earlier terms for this condition include toxic postpartum HF, Meadows&rsquo; syndrome, Zaria syndrome, and postpartum myocardiosis.</p><p>Treatment of PPCM is similar to that employed for other types of HF with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. However, modifications to standard therapy are often necessary to ensure the safety of the mother and the unborn or breastfeeding child.

Additional therapeutic issues for this population may include arrhythmia management, anticoagulation therapy, mechanical support, and investigational therapies such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284798904\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart failure treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In women with PPCM and HF, the goals of medical therapy are similar to those in patients with acute and chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction due to other causes.

The treatment of HF in pregnant and breastfeeding patients is discussed in detail separately. Briefly, women with HF during pregnancy should be treated similarly to other patients with HF. However, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, and aldosterone antagonists are to be avoided, as they are contraindicated in pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-heart-failure-during-pregnancy#H134212866\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of heart failure during pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Treatment regimens'</a>.)</p><p>For women with peripartum cardiomyopathy who have delivered and are not breastfeeding, acute and chronic HF are managed using standard therapy.

The reported incidence of ventricular arrhythmias has been variable. A large inpatient database study reported that of 9841 hospitalizations for PPCM, 18.7 percent had an arrhythmia, with ventricular tachycardia occurring in 4.2 percent and cardiac arrest in 2.2 percent. Much smaller series have reported rates between 20 and 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Atrial fibrillation also occurs commonly and was observed in 3.1 to 11.9 percent of patients with PPCM in various studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,9</a>]. Management of arrhythmias during pregnancy is discussed separately.

Since up to 20 to 60 percent of women with PPCM have complete recovery of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to normal by six months to five years (see <a href=\"#H1644183326\" class=\"local\">'Recovery of left ventricular function'</a> below), ICD placement should generally be deferred at least three months and possibly even six months following presentation, with the patient receiving optimum medical therapy to determine whether criteria for placement are present. Whether a wearable defibrillator would prevent sudden cardiac death in those being monitored for LVEF improvement is untested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]. Furthermore, a wearable defibrillator is not without its risks and concerns. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wearable-cardioverter-defibrillator#H6129304\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wearable cardioverter-defibrillator&quot;, section on 'Newly diagnosed nonischemic cardiomyopathy'</a>.) </p><p>Information on the use of cardiac resynchronization therapy in PPCM is limited, but a limited observational case series of eight patients suggests that resynchronization in medically optimized patients resulted in improved systolic function and cardiac remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Cardiac resynchronization therapy should generally be deferred until at least three months and possibly even six months following presentation, with the patient receiving optimum medical therapy to determine whether criteria for placement are present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure: Indications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284798970\"><span class=\"h2\">Antithrombotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with PPCM are at high risk for thrombus formation and thromboembolism due to both the hypercoagulable state of pregnancy and stasis of blood due to severe LV dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. However, data are inconclusive on the utility of antithrombotic therapy (antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation) to reduce thromboembolic events or mortality in patients with systolic HF who are in sinus rhythm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-heart-failure#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombotic therapy in patients with heart failure&quot;, section on 'Role of antithrombotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p>For pregnant women who require anticoagulation, anticoagulation decisions and choosing a specific anticoagulation regimen are challenging due to specific risks during various stages of pregnancy, including the potential teratogenic effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> in the first trimester, dosing complexities of the various agents, and management during labor and delivery. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-anticoagulants-during-pregnancy-and-postpartum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of anticoagulants during pregnancy and postpartum&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Our approach to antithrombotic therapy in patients with PPCM is the same as that for other patients with LV systolic dysfunction (with or without HF). For patients with LV systolic dysfunction (with or without HF) without LV thrombus or other indications for antithrombotic therapy, we do not recommend antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-heart-failure#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombotic therapy in patients with heart failure&quot;, section on 'Our approach'</a>). One exception is for patients with PPCM receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a>, as thromboembolic events (including stroke and myocardial infarction) have been reported as a complication of bromocriptine use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. We suggest anticoagulation in patients with PPCM treated with bromocriptine (which we consider investigational in this setting, as discussed below), although controlled data are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4043606371\" class=\"local\">'Bromocriptine'</a> below.)</p><p>Although data are limited, we suggest anticoagulation for patients with PPCM who have acute intracardiac thrombus or evidence of systemic embolism. This recommendation is consistent with recommendations for management of acute ventricular thrombus or thromboembolism in patients with HF generally. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-heart-failure#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombotic therapy in patients with heart failure&quot;, section on 'Role of antithrombotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Standard guidelines for antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation should be followed in patients with PPCM and atrial fibrillation, including recommending anticoagulation for patients with PPCM with HF and atrial fibrillation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284798988\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanical circulatory support and cardiac transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) should be considered early in patients who are hemodynamically unstable and unresponsive to medical therapy with maximal inotropic support. A device can be implanted in the acute phase either as a &quot;bridge-to-recovery&quot; with subsequent weaning as ventricular function improves or as a &quot;bridge-to-bridge&quot; with implantation of a more durable device if continued circulatory support is required. A &quot;bridge-to-transplantation&quot; approach is rarely required as the initial approach because a high proportion of PPCM patients will have some recovery of ventricular function. Thus, a temporary device should always be initially preferred. </p><p>In patients with PPCM, a severely depressed baseline LVEF alone should not be considered an indication for use of aggressive therapies such as MCS and cardiac transplantation. In PPCM, lower baseline LVEF is associated with lower likelihood of recovery of LVEF with medical management as discussed below. However, the baseline LVEF does not adequately predict the probability of recovery in individual patients. (See <a href=\"#H284799024\" class=\"local\">'Maternal outcome'</a> below.)</p><p>When MCS is indicated, devices that can be used include intra-aortic balloon counter pulsation (IABP), venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and LV assist device (LVAD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The choice of which initial device to implant will depend on patient hemodynamics and local availability and expertise. Venoarterial ECMO has been associated with an increase in prolactin levels, which may be detrimental in PPCM patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].<strong> </strong>Some experts have suggested administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> doses up to 10 mg twice daily to suppress prolactin levels in patients receiving venoarterial ECMO with significantly elevated prolactin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, we do not use of bromocriptine to suppress prolactin levels in patients receiving venoarterial ECMO as there is little evidence to support this treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Outcomes were reported for 1258 women, which included 99 with PPCM, who had received durable mechanical circulatory support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Women with PPCM who received durable mechanical circulatory support had better survival than women without PPCM, with two-year survival of 83 percent for the PPCM cohort. These differences were likely due to the fact that women with PPCM were younger and had fewer comorbidities. However, rates of recovery of myocardial function were poor at 6 percent in the PPCM group and 2 percent in those without PPCM. Indications and use of mechanical circulatory support are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-term-mechanical-circulatory-assist-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short-term mechanical circulatory assist devices&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intermediate- and long-term mechanical circulatory support&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=practical-management-of-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Practical management of long-term mechanical circulatory support devices&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Older studies found that transplantation was performed in up to one-third of women with PPCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Contemporary reports demonstrate that transplantation rates vary from 4 to 23 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>]. Thus, women with PPCM and significant LV systolic dysfunction should be managed at a center with transplant capabilities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-contraindications-for-cardiac-transplantation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and contraindications for cardiac transplantation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the potential maternal and fetal risks related to pregnancy after heart transplantation for any reason (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-after-cardiac-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy after cardiac transplantation&quot;</a>), women who have been transplanted for PPCM have worse outcomes compared with other cardiac transplant recipients. The largest series of cardiac transplantation for PPCM included 485 patients from the UNOS database and found worse long-term survival in patients transplanted for PPCM compared with all others undergoing transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Women with PPCM who received a cardiac transplant had higher mortality, higher incidence of rejection, poorer graft survival, and higher retransplantation rates. Younger patient age, higher allosensitization, higher pretransplant acuity, and increased rejection rates are all thought to play a role in these poorer outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3850655362\"><span class=\"h2\">Investigational therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following investigational therapies are not recommended for PPCM since the efficacy and safety of these approaches have not been established. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4043606371\"><span class=\"h3\">Bromocriptine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> therapy in PPCM is controversial. While preliminary data have suggested a benefit from bromocriptine in patients with PPCM, further trials are needed to establish safety and efficacy. Until additional data are available, we suggest not routinely using bromocriptine for patients with PPCM. Some other experts advocate using bromocriptine routinely in this setting. </p><p>This treatment strategy is based upon an experimental observation of prevention of PPCM in mice via prolactin blockade with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A small randomized pilot study and several observational reports have suggested a beneficial response to bromocriptine therapy in patients with PPCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4,29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,29-32</a>]. However, available data are insufficient to recommend routine use of bromocriptine treatment for PPCM. Of note, the drug stops the production of breast milk making breastfeeding impossible. </p><p>In a randomized open-label study performed in South Africa, 20 women with newly diagnosed PPCM were randomly assigned to receive either standard care plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> (2.5 mg twice daily for two weeks followed by 2.5 mg daily for six weeks) or standard care alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The 10 women receiving bromocriptine demonstrated significantly greater improvement in LVEF as compared with the 10 women receiving standard care only (27 to 58 percent versus 27 to 36 percent). One patient in the bromocriptine group died as compared with four in the standard care group. Fewer patients in the bromocriptine group reached the composite end point of death, New York Heart Association functional class III or IV HF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 1</a>), or LVEF &lt;35 percent at six months, as compared with patients in the standard care group (one versus eight). The generalizability of these results is unclear given the small sample size, the higher than expected mortality rate in the standard care group, and differences in characteristics of PPCM in patients in Africa as compared with those elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>A subsequent multicenter trial performed in Germany enrolled 63 women with PPCM with LVEF &le;35 percent who were randomly assigned to short-term <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> (one week of 2.5 mg daily) or long-term bromocriptine (eight weeks: 5 mg for two weeks followed by 2.5 mg for six weeks) in addition to standard HF therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Improvement in LVEF as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at six months was similar in the two groups (28 to 49 percent in the one-week group and 27 to 51 percent in the eight-week group). The frequency of full recovery (LVEF &ge;50 percent) was nominally but not significantly higher in the eight-week group compared with the one-week group (68 versus 52 percent). None of the patients required heart transplantation, left ventricular assist devices (LVAD), or died during the study period. Thus, the patients in this trial had better outcomes than observed in prior series of PPCM, but a placebo control group was not included in the study. (See <a href=\"#H284799024\" class=\"local\">'Maternal outcome'</a> below.)</p><p>As noted above, we suggest anticoagulation in patients with PPCM treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> (when this investigational therapy is used) given the risk of thromboembolic complications.

A subset of patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy will achieve full recovery of LV function (ejection fraction [LVEF] &gt;50 percent). It must be emphasized that LV dysfunction can re-occur despite initial full recovery and this recurrence risk is not limited to occurring during subsequent pregnancies. For patients with recovery of LV function, there are limited studies examining the relationship between medication withdrawal and clinical outcomes and there are no major societal guidelines regarding this management pathway. Clinical markers (ie, contractile reserve on stress echocardiography) or biomarkers that may predict outcomes in this group are under study. </p><p>In those patients who demonstrate <strong>persistent normal</strong> <strong>LV function</strong> (LVEF &gt;50 percent) <strong>for a&nbsp;period of at least six months</strong>,&nbsp;we suggest stepwise weaning of the HF regimen with close clinical follow-up (eg, every three to four months) and with echocardiographic monitoring (eg, every six months) to ensure stability of LV function during and for at least one to two years after weaning of HF medications to ensure stability.&nbsp;</p><p>An example of such a protocol is described in a review, as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. If LV structure and function have recovered and remain normal for six months, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a>) is withdrawn with continuation of beta blockade and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) <span class=\"nowrap\">inhibitors/angiotensin</span> II receptor blockers (ARBs). If, six months after stopping the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, LV function remains normal and the patient remains free of clinical HF symptoms, withdrawal of the ACE <span class=\"nowrap\">inhibitor/ARB</span> is suggested.&nbsp;The patient then continues on beta blockade alone. If there is no decline in LV function, the patient is then weaned from beta blocker therapy, preferably over a period of two to four weeks to avoid rebound phenomena, and again with close clinical monitoring and echocardiographic follow-up.&nbsp;Loop diuretics or thiazides may be discontinued at any time (even before full recovery of LV function) if the patient is free of congestive symptoms;&nbsp;recurrence of congestive symptoms would prompt reintroduction of these medications. </p><p>A decline in LV systolic function as documented by echocardiographic assessment, or the recurrence of HF symptoms at any point in the process of weaning HF medications, would dictate a reinstitution of standard HF therapy.&nbsp;</p><p>These recommendations are based on expert opinion only; there is a paucity of data in this area to guide clinicians.&nbsp;Therefore, it is imperative that if HF therapies are withdrawn, the patient should be followed clinically and by echocardiography to ensure stability, as described above. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284799018\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) includes maternal, obstetric, and neonatal outcomes, and the effect of subsequent pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284799024\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have evaluated the outcome of women with PPCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peripartum-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10,23-25,44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,23-25,44-48</a>].
