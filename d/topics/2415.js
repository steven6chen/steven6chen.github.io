If you have a c-section, you will be given anesthesia so that you won't feel pain. Then the doctor will make an incision in your belly and remove the baby from your uterus. About 1 in 3 babies in the United States is born this way. Most babies come out of their mother's vagina. This is called &quot;vaginal delivery.&quot; C-sections are also called &quot;cesarean deliveries.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197175637\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I know in advance if I need a c-section?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might. The most common reasons women have a cesarean delivery before they go into labor are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mother had a baby by cesarean in the past</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The baby is not coming out head first</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The baby is very large</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mother has an infection, such as herpes or HIV. These can spread to the baby during a vaginal birth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mother has a condition called &quot;placenta previa.&quot; The placenta is the organ that brings the baby nutrients and oxygen and carries away waste. In placenta previa, this organ blocks the way to the vagina. As a result, the baby can't get out on its own.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The baby has a problem, and the doctor believes labor and vaginal delivery might not be safe because of it.</p><p/><p>Some women choose to have cesareans even if they don't need to. You should talk to your doctor if you think you want to have your baby this way. Surgery brings real risks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197175644\"><span class=\"h1\">When should planned c-sections happen?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, you should wait until the 39<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy or later. (A normal pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197175651\"><span class=\"h1\">Why do some women end up having c-sections after labor begins?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A common reason is that labor doesn't move along like it should. This can happen if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contractions (the tightening of the uterus that happens during labor) are not strong enough to get the baby out</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The baby is too big</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mother's pelvis is too small (the pelvis is the set of bones around your hips and vagina)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The baby is in an odd position, such as sideways or chin-first</p><p/><p>Other reasons that c-sections are done are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The baby's life is in danger; for example, because its heart rate is too slow.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mother's life is in danger; for example, because she is bleeding too much.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197175658\"><span class=\"h1\">If my labor is moving slowly, will I need to have a c-section?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not necessarily. First, your doctor or nurse might offer a medicine called oxytocin (brand name: Pitocin). The medicine should make your contractions stronger. If that doesn't help within a few hours, your doctor might suggest a c-section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197175665\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a c-section done?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Here are the main steps:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First, you will get anesthesia to keep you from feeling what happens during the surgery. There are 2 kinds of anesthesia. With regional anesthesia, you stay awake. Under general anesthesia, you are asleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Next, the doctor will make an incision on your lower belly. There are 2 ways of making the incision:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most of the time, the incision goes across your belly, from 1 side to the other, an inch or 2 above your pubic hair.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If you are bleeding a lot or your baby is in danger, the incision might go up and down. This kind of incision is sometimes the fastest way to get the baby out.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After opening your belly, the doctor will make an opening in your uterus and remove the baby. Then the doctor will cut the umbilical cord and take out the placenta.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Finally, the doctor will close your uterus and belly with stitches and possibly staples.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197175672\"><span class=\"h1\">How long does it take to get better after the surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Within a few hours, you will be able to move around, and eat and drink. Most women go home after 3 days, but will have some pain. It can take up to 6 weeks to heal completely. Women who have a job can usually go back to work after this time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197175679\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there risks of having a c-section?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Although most mothers and babies do well after a c-section, there are risks.</p><p>Compared with a vaginal delivery, c-sections are more likely to cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Harm to the bladder, blood vessels, intestines, and other nearby organs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood clots that can block blood vessels and cause trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lost bonding time between mother and baby</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A longer time for the mother to heal after the birth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the placenta and uterus in later pregnancies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing for the newborn. This usually lasts for just a short time.</p><p/><p>Your doctor can help you decide if the risks of surgery are worth taking for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197175686\"><span class=\"h1\">What symptoms will I have while I'm getting better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the first few weeks, it is common to have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild cramps in your belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Light bleeding and yellowish fluids coming out of your vagina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain where the incision was made</p><p/><p>Call your doctor if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a fever higher than 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your pain gets worse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your vaginal bleeding gets heavier</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incision in your belly gets more sore or red, or is bleeding or leaking fluid</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197175693\"><span class=\"h1\">If I have a c-section, will all of my future deliveries have to be c-sections?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not anymore. Today, many women have a &quot;trial of labor&quot; after their previous c-section. This is called a &quot;TOLAC.&quot; A vaginal birth after c-sections is called a &quot;VBAC.&quot; If the cut in your uterus in the first c-section went from side to side (instead of up to down), you have a good chance of being able to have a vaginal birth with your next baby. Ask your doctor if a trial of labor is possible for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197175700\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amniocentesis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Amniocentesis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=labor-and-delivery-childbirth-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Labor and delivery (childbirth) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-dystocia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Shoulder dystocia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-birth-after-cesarean-delivery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=having-twins-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Having twins (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breech-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breech pregnancy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amniocentesis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Amniocentesis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-birth-after-cesarean-delivery-vbac-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
