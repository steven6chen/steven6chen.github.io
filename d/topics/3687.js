These conditions are due to abnormalities of the developing fetal or infantile brain resulting from a variety of causes. The motor impairment generally results in limitations in functional abilities and activity which can range in severity. Multiple additional symptoms often accompany the primary motor abnormalities, including altered sensation or perception, intellectual disability, communication and behavioral difficulties, seizure disorders, and musculoskeletal complications. Although the underlying etiology itself is not progressive, the clinical expression may change over time as the brain matures.</p><p>The clinical features and classification of CP are reviewed here. The epidemiology, etiology, prevention, evaluation, diagnosis, management, and prognosis are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-etiology-and-prevention-of-cerebral-palsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, etiology, and prevention of cerebral palsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-cerebral-palsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of cerebral palsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of cerebral palsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MOTOR ABNORMALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CP is characterized by abnormalities of motor activity and posture. In affected patients, voluntary movements that should be complex, coordinated, and varied are instead uncoordinated, stereotypic, and limited. Simple actions that are performed unconsciously by unaffected individuals require marked effort and concentration and often fail in patients with CP. In severely affected individuals, an attempted voluntary movement may evoke a primitive reflex, co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles, and mass movements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For example, attempts at flexion of one particular joint may involve all segments of a limb, and extension of all the fingers may accompany extension of the wrist. Discrete movements, such as that of an individual finger, may be impossible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88041\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classification of CP is based upon the type and distribution of motor abnormalities, which often correlate to location of injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74533\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74533 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This approach to describing CP is common, but has certain limitations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classification scheme defines distinct subtypes, but in reality, there is substantial overlap in the clinical features of these subtypes, with frequent coexistence of multiple motoric abnormalities (eg, mild dyskinetic signs [eg, involuntary movements] may occur in all the spastic subtypes, and patients with dyskinetic and ataxic forms of CP may have signs of spasticity).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical features change over time (eg, a patient with CP may have predominantly spasticity during early childhood, but during adolescence, dystonia may become more prominent with greater limits on functionality).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classification is somewhat subjective and may be inconsistent between providers.</p><p/><p>Causes of different CP subtypes are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-etiology-and-prevention-of-cerebral-palsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, etiology, and prevention of cerebral palsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.ccshrif.org/download/Resource%20Corner%20and%20Tools/GMFCS-ER.pdf&amp;token=R4Uiw8/bmPVaqNHRDqpXLGqcvQqd+y4eBSMI7wINB/Pc78RuIamP2sa5r1dDjXP5VIV7qveMwGziKLPgnuYWhtRTsv4PuxxuKKNvd9fqgRgFW71RmeaEE/hDjlJBXWM1&amp;TOPIC_ID=6167\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Gross Motor Function Classification System</a> (GMFCS) is used to categorize functional motor impairment in children with CP. GMFCS level coupled with a child's CP subtype allows providers to quickly grasp a global impression of a child's presentation. The GMFCS is also useful for tracking responses to interventions and comparing groups of children in research. Other widely used tools for evaluating function include the <a href=\"http://www.macs.nu/&amp;token=EcBV29j6Wf11fYv7p1I3bwLE+9hVc+y6Jq+4TxJvlGA=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6167\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Manual Ability Classification System</a> (MACS) and the <a href=\"http://cfcs.us/&amp;token=j9UWcFlTVb5IfQxyO4+M14vR8ciQfk800A463Fedms0=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6167\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Communication Function Classification System</a> (CFCS). These tools are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy#H107637599\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of cerebral palsy&quot;, section on 'Functional evaluation'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16407646\"><span class=\"h2\">Early signs of CP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants who are at risk for developing CP include those with an abnormal pre- or perinatal history, especially a history of prematurity, low birth weight (BW), multiple gestation, infection, or known brain dysmorphology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F102940\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102940 \">table 2</a>). Close monitoring is crucial for these at-risk infants, and referral to an early intervention program <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> developmental specialist is often warranted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-etiology-and-prevention-of-cerebral-palsy#H338437639\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, etiology, and prevention of cerebral palsy&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>The average age at diagnosis for children with CP is 18 to 24 months; however, suggestive signs and symptoms may be present in infancy. Presentation generally points to a specific CP subtype, though there is substantial overlap in the clinical features of these subtypes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74533\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74533 \">table 1</a>). It is important to note that although the cause of CP is nonprogressive, symptoms and functional ability continue to evolve as the nervous system matures. Thus, a definitive diagnosis usually requires serial examinations. Early diagnosis is an active area of research.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16408671\"><span class=\"h3\">Neurobehavioral signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurobehavioral signs suspicious for CP are excessive docility or irritability. A typical history includes poor feeding in the neonatal period. The baby often is irritable, sleeps poorly, vomits frequently, is difficult to handle and cuddle, and has poor visual attention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16408839\"><span class=\"h3\">Developmental reflexes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In normal development, most motor reflexes related to posture (eg, tonic labyrinthine, tonic neck, Gallant) disappear in infancy between three and six months of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58453\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58453 \">table 3</a>). In infants and children with CP, these reflexes often are not appropriately integrated or inhibited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thus, delay in the disappearance or exaggeration of a developmental reflex may be an early indication of motor disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. An obligatory developmental reflex (a response that persists for as long as the stimulus is applied) is abnormal at any age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=detailed-neurologic-assessment-of-infants-and-children#H10929149\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Detailed neurologic assessment of infants and children&quot;, section on 'Developmental reflexes'</a>.)</p><p>Infants with an exaggerated tonic labyrinthine response may have opisthotonic posturing or roll over at an age that is earlier than appropriate. The tonic labyrinthine response is tested in the supine position. Extension of the neck results in shoulder retraction, leg extension, and either elbow flexion or extension and pronation of the arms. Flexion of the neck results in flexion of the extremities.</p><p>Other abnormal signs can be elicited when the infant is held in vertical suspension. During the first few months, the appropriate response is for the baby to assume a sitting position (&quot;sit in the air&quot;). An abnormal response is persistent extension of the legs. This may be followed by or associated with an abnormal positive support reaction. The latter is tested by placing the anteromedial areas of the soles on a firm surface, which should result in a few seconds of plantar flexion, then return of the feet to a neutral position. An abnormal response is plantar flexion that is obligate or maintained for more than 30 seconds, especially if accompanied by equinus posturing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16408677\"><span class=\"h3\">Motor tone and posture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tone in the extremities may be normal, decreased, or increased. Persistent or asymmetric fisting may be present. Abnormal oromotor patterns include tongue retraction and thrust, tonic bite, oral hypersensitivity, and grimacing. Poor head control may be an early motor sign. However, increased neck extensor and axial tone may make head control appear better than it actually is.</p><p>The infant should be observed in the prone and supine positions. Posture and tone are assessed on pulling to sit, supported sitting, and vertical and ventral suspension. The infant should be able to support himself or herself on arms and hands and rotate within the body axis at the appropriate ages. The emergence and quality of protective postural reactions should be noted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H338432840\"><span class=\"h3\">Motor milestones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the neurologic examination, achievement of motor milestones should be evaluated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F102836%7EPEDS%2F103006\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102836 graphicRef103006 \">table 4A-B</a>). Serial examination using motor milestones can be an effective screening process for CP. Children's motor development should be addressed at every pediatric preventive care visit. In addition, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends completion of a general developmental screening test (which includes assessment of motor skills) at the 9-, 18-, 30-, and 48-month visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-behavioral-surveillance-and-screening-in-primary-care#H2651325861\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental-behavioral surveillance and screening in primary care&quot;, section on 'Approach to screening'</a>.)</p><p>While nonspecific, the most common delayed motor milestones in children with CP are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not sitting by eight months (corrected for gestational age [GA])</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not walking by 18 months (corrected for GA)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early asymmetry of hand function (hand preference) before one year (corrected for GA)</p><p/><p>In one study, six motor milestones (roll prone to supine, roll supine to prone, sit with support, sit without support, crawl, and cruise) were sequentially evaluated for at least 18 months in 173 infants born at &lt;33 weeks GA, of whom 31 (18 percent) developed CP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Serial screening of these milestones predicted the development of CP better than did any individual milestone. Delays in more than four milestones were especially worrisome. In another report, signs present at four months of age that indicated increased risk of CP were failure to support weight on the forearms in a prone position, sit supported with head erect, or show interest in surroundings or respond socially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1479191130\"><span class=\"h2\">CP subtypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After age 18 to 24 months, signs and symptoms generally point to a specific subtype of CP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74533\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74533 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16407315\"><span class=\"h3\">Spastic subtypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spastic subtypes have variable expression. They may be symmetric or asymmetric, and may involve one or more extremities.</p><p>Patients with spastic CP have features of an upper motor neuron syndrome. In children with CP, the signs of upper motor neuron differ from those in patients with adult-onset disease because the developing nervous system responds differently to insults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Upper motor neuron syndrome includes positive and negative signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive signs &minus; Positive signs are abnormalities that lead to involuntarily increased muscle activity or movement patterns:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Spasticity &minus; Spasticity refers to the velocity-dependent increased resistance that occurs in response to passive muscle stretch. In the classic form, described as clasp-knife, the maximum resistance occurs after a few degrees of passive movement of a joint, which then relaxes after continued effort by the examiner. More rapid movement of the joint increases the degree of resistance, and decreases its time of onset. Spastic hypertonia is increased by stress and during voluntary movement when co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles may occur. In the most severe form, the affected part is rigid in flexion or extension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hyperreflexia caused by hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extensor plantar responses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Clonus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Negative signs &minus; Negative signs reflect insufficient muscle activity or insufficient control of muscle activity that interferes with function. Negative signs of spastic CP include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Slow, effortful voluntary movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Impaired fine-motor function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Difficulty in isolating individual movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fatigability and weakness</p><p/><p>Negative features tend to cause more disability than positive features and are less amenable to treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16406669\"><span class=\"h4\">Spastic diplegia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with mild spastic diplegia may have relatively good hand function and fewer associated disabilities. In more severely affected patients, upper limb function also may be compromised, depending upon the degree of spasticity and presence of contractures. Sensory loss, associated involuntary movements, and intellectual disability also may be present.</p><p>Affected patients have variable degrees of flexion at the elbows and knees, and flexion, adduction, and internal rotation of the hips. They may have an equinovalgus or calcaneovarus deformity of the foot. Extension of the fingers, abduction of the thumb, extension of the wrist, and supination of the forearm may be limited. These features may be associated with poor grasp release and involuntary or associated movements.</p><p>Atrophy below the waist occurs in many patients. Sensory disturbances of central nervous system origin, such as poor two-point discrimination and astereognosis, are common in all the spastic syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Vasomotor abnormalities also occur.</p><p>Asymmetric spastic diplegia may occur in patients with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) and unilateral hemorrhagic infarction. It is usually associated with more severe disability than symmetric spastic diplegia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H338438895\"><span class=\"h4\">Spastic hemiplegia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In congenital spastic hemiplegia, the arm typically is more affected than the leg, although the presentation is variable. The shoulder on the affected side is usually retracted and the fingers tend to be held in flexion with adduction of the thumb. The hip is partially flexed and adducted, and the knee and ankle are flexed.</p><p>In spastic hemiplegia with a postnatal etiology, motor handicap usually is only mild or moderate. Athetotic posturing sometimes accompanies the spasticity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Most children with spastic hemiplegia also have sensory deficits. These are correlated with poor growth of the affected side, although not with the severity of the motor deficit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16407486\"><span class=\"h4\">Spastic quadriplegia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with spastic quadriplegia (also called tetraplegia) typically are severely handicapped. They are more likely to have associated impairments such as severe intellectual disability, communication impairment, visual impairment, epilepsy, feeding difficulties, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary disease compared with children with hemiplegia or diplegia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Associated conditions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Dyskinetic subtypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with dyskinetic CP often have more than one form of involuntary movement, and the types may overlap in some cases. Dyskinesia may also be seen in some children with spastic CP. The extent of dysarthria and motor and intellectual disability are variable. Unlike patients with spastic CP, those with purely dyskinetic syndromes usually do not develop contractures, unless they are positional. When this occurs, they tend to evolve at a slower rate than in individuals with spasticity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H338438927\"><span class=\"h4\">Choreoathetosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chorea consists of rapid, irregular, unpredictable contractions of individual muscles or small muscle groups that involve the face, bulbar muscles, proximal extremities, and fingers and toes. Athetosis consists of slow, smooth, writhing movements that involve distal muscles.</p><p>Children with choreoathetotic CP have dyssynergia (antagonistic action) of opposing muscle groups, such as flexion and extension or pronation and supination. Emotion, sudden environmental stimuli, change in posture, or intended movement may accentuate or induce the abnormal movements. Athetosis is most apparent during reaching, as the fingers extend and abduct. Stress, excitement, or fever may exacerbate the chorea. In some cases, fever may result in ballismus, a form of severe, coarse chorea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Primitive reflexes often are retained. Oropharyngeal difficulties may result from facial grimacing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H338439041\"><span class=\"h4\">Dystonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary, sustained muscle contraction resulting in twisting and repetitive movements or postures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. It is a dynamic disorder that changes in severity depending upon activity and posture. It commonly disappears with certain postures and with sleep.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Ataxic subtype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of ataxic CP is variable and often the etiology is elusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Motor milestones and language skills typically are delayed. Ataxia may improve with time. In general, associated disabilities are worse with increasing severity of motor impairment. Speech, which is related to intellectual ability, typically is slow, jerky, and explosive.</p><p>Ataxic CP is rare and should always be distinguished from genetic and progressive neurodegenerative disorders, which may present with some of the same features. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-cerebral-palsy#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of cerebral palsy&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>A separate category of &quot;hypotonic CP&quot; (also called &quot;atonic CP&quot;) has been described, though it is generally absent from contemporary classifications. The majority of patients with &quot;hypotonic CP&quot; in early infancy later develop spastic, dyskinetic, and particularly ataxic CP. However, in some cases, tone remains decreased or becomes variable and paratonic (ie, with passive movement of a joint, resistance increases proportionally to the amount of pressure applied). Development is extremely delayed, and affected children rarely stand or walk. Typical findings that characterize other CP syndromes are absent in this disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CP is often accompanied by other disorders of cerebral function. Associated abnormalities may affect cognition, vision, hearing, language, cortical sensation, attention, vigilance, and behavior. Some children have epilepsy, and many have disturbed gastrointestinal function and growth. Dyspraxias and agnosias may interfere with skilled tasks, regardless of the severity of motor deficit. In a child with relatively mild CP, for example, disorders of higher cortical function may interfere with activities of daily living, such as dressing or managing buttons.</p><p>Based upon systematic reviews of published literature, estimated frequencies of other conditions are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain (50 to 75 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intellectual disability (50 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Speech-language disorders (40 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epilepsy (25 to 40 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual impairment (30 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hip displacement (30 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavior disorder (25 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder control problems (30 to 60 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep disorder (20 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drooling (20 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hearing impairment (10 to 20 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrostomy-tube dependence (7 percent)</p><p/><p>In general, children with more severe motor disabilities are more likely to have comorbid conditions.</p><p>Because of these risks, all children with CP should undergo routine screening for intellectual, visual, auditory, and speech impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Abnormal screening results call for more detailed evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-cerebral-palsy#H338442628\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of cerebral palsy&quot;, section on 'Screening for associated conditions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Intellectual disability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intellectual disability (ID) occurs in approximately 50 percent of patients with CP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. The severity of ID often correlates with the extent of motor handicap, particularly in children with spastic CP.

Classification of CP is based upon the type and distribution of motor abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74533\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74533 \">table 1</a>). There may be substantial overlap among the clinical features. The <a href=\"https://www.ccshrif.org/download/Resource%20Corner%20and%20Tools/GMFCS-ER.pdf&amp;token=R4Uiw8/bmPVaqNHRDqpXLGqcvQqd+y4eBSMI7wINB/Pc78RuIamP2sa5r1dDjXP5VIV7qveMwGziKLPgnuYWhtRTsv4PuxxuKKNvd9fqgRgFW71RmeaEE/hDjlJBXWM1&amp;TOPIC_ID=6167\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Gross Motor Function Classification System</a> (GMFCS) is commonly used to characterize functional motor impairment. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H88041\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of CP in infancy and early childhood include neurobehavioral abnormalities (eg, excessive docility or irritability), abnormal tone, abnormal posture, persistence of primitive reflexes, and failure to achieve motor milestones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F102836%7EPEDS%2F103006\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102836 graphicRef103006 \">table 4A-B</a>). Early signs of CP differ somewhat based upon the specific subtype of CP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74533\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74533 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H16407646\" class=\"local\">'Early signs of CP'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After age 18 to 24 months, signs and symptoms generally point to a specific subtype of CP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74533\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74533 \">table 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Spastic CP includes spastic diplegia, spastic hemiplegia, and spastic quadriplegia. Spastic CP is an upper motor neuron syndrome, which includes spastic hypertonia, hyperreflexia, extensor plantar responses, and clonus. Affected patients also have slow effortful voluntary movements, impaired fine-motor function, difficulty in isolating individual movements, and fatigability. (See <a href=\"#H16407315\" class=\"local\">'Spastic subtypes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dyskinetic CP is characterized by involuntary movements of athetosis, chorea, and dystonia. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Dyskinetic subtypes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ataxic CP is characterized by ataxic movements and speech, usually associated with widespread disorder of motor function. Ataxic CP is rare, and children who present with these findings should be evaluated for other potential causes of ataxia. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Ataxic subtype'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CP often is accompanied by other disorders of cerebral function, including intellectual disability, behavioral and emotional disorders, seizures, visual and hearing impairment, and speech disorders. In addition, many children have growth failure, pulmonary disease, orthopedic problems (eg, joint subluxations and dislocations and hip dysplasia), osteopenia, urinary disorders, sleep disturbance, and sialorrhea. Pain is very common in children with CP, is often underdiagnosed, and can greatly impact quality of life. In general, children with more severe motor disabilities are more likely to have comorbid conditions. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Associated conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3203578178\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Geoffrey Miller, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Rosenbloom L.
