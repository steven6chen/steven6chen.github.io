Colonization of the intestinal tract occurs via the fecal-oral route and is facilitated by disruption of normal intestinal flora due to antimicrobial therapy. The organism is capable of elaborating exotoxins that bind to receptors on intestinal epithelial cells, leading to inflammation and diarrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51819\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51819 \">figure 1</a>).

In 1978, <em>C. difficile</em> was identified as the causative pathogen in the majority of cases, and the earliest cases of <em>C. difficile</em> were attributed largely to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Increasing use of penicillins and cephalosporins subsequently led to the implication of these antibiotic classes, although clindamycin remains an important culprit. Between 1989 and 1992, a strain of <em>C. difficile</em> highly resistant to clindamycin (the &quot;J strain&quot;) was implicated in large outbreaks of diarrhea in four hospitals in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The use of clindamycin is a specific risk factor for this strain, and colonization with the clindamycin-resistant strain increases the risk for developing <em>C. difficile</em>&ndash;associated diarrhea (CDAD).</p><p>From 2003 to 2006, <em>C. difficile</em> infections were observed to be more frequent, severe, refractory to standard therapy, and likely to relapse than previously described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These observations have occurred throughout North America and Europe and have been attributed to a new strain designated BI, NAP1, or ribotype 027 (these designations are based on different methods for strain typing and all refer to the same strain, known as strain <span class=\"nowrap\">NAP1/BI/027)</span>. This strain appears to be more virulent than other strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], which may be attributable to increased toxin production compared with conventional strains. Fluoroquinolone use has strongly correlated with the emergence of this strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and acquisition of fluoroquinolone resistance by outbreak strains appears to have contributed to the increasing frequency of CDAD outbreaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Hypervirulent strain: NAP1/BI/027'</a> below.)</p><p>In Quebec, Canada, an increase in the frequency and severity of CDAD was observed in the early 2000s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. A retrospective review of 1771 cases from this region demonstrated that, in 2003, the incidence of CDAD per 100,000 had increased fourfold since 1991; the incidence had risen 10-fold for individuals over 65 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among hospitalized patients, the incidence increased from 3 to 12 per 1000 persons (1991 to 2002) to 25 to 43 per 1000 persons (2003 to 2004). These cases were more serious and refractory to therapy, with significant rates of toxic megacolon and disease requiring colectomy. Ten percent of cases required admission to an intensive care, and 2.5 percent underwent an emergency colectomy; the mortality was 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Concurrent with the Quebec outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) noted reports of increasing frequency and severity of <em>C. difficile</em> in the United States, including eight hospital outbreaks in six states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. After reports of these emerging outbreaks in Canada and in the United States, CDAD due to the same implicated strain was also detected in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Between 1999 and 2007 in the United States, <em>C. difficile</em> was the main contributor to gastroenteritis-associated deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Since 2005, <em>C. difficile</em> infection due to ribotype 078 has emerged in the Netherlands. Patients with disease due to this type present with similar severity as those with type 027, although type 078 appears to affect a younger population, is more frequently community associated, and is genetically similar to porcine isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Among 1366 Dutch patients hospitalized between 2006 and 2009, <em>C. difficile</em> infection was associated with a 2.5-fold increase in 30-day mortality (95% CI 1.4-4.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Control strategies depend on improved understanding of <em>C. difficile</em> molecular epidemiology in healthcare facilities, which appears to be dynamic and diverse. In a longitudinal analysis of <em>C. difficile</em> strains isolated in a single institution between 1982 and 1991, not all epidemiologic fluctuations could be attributed to emergence of the epidemic BI strain, since treatment failure and relapse were also associated with non-BI strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The predominant <em>C. difficile</em> organisms varied over the study period, suggesting a changing population that was probably the result of introduction of new strains by patients admitted to the institution. Subsequently, a cross-sectional study demonstrated that ribotype may not be a significant predictor of severe CDAD. Among 310 CDAD cases, including 34 severe cases, the association between ribotypes 027 and 078 was not significant after adjustment for other covariables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In 2011, an estimated 453,000 cases of <em>C. difficile</em> occurred in the United States; 83,000 episodes were first recurrences, and 29,300 patients died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The incidence was higher in women than in men (rate ratio 1.26; 95 percent CI 1.25-1.27), in whites than nonwhites (rate ratio 1.72; 95 percent CI 1.56-2.00), and in individuals aged &ge;65 years than in those aged &lt;65 (rate ratio 8.65; 95 percent CI 8.16-9.31). An estimated 159,700 cases were community associated and 293,000 were healthcare associated, with 107,600 of them hospital acquired. The NAP1 strain was identified more often in healthcare-associated cases than in community-associated cases (30.7 versus 18.8 percent).</p><p>Between 2012 and 2016, the overall prevalence of <span class=\"nowrap\">BI/NAP1/027</span> among more than 7500 patients within the US Veterans Affairs medical centers decreased from 26 to 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H832803852\"><span class=\"h2\">Nosocomial infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dramatic increases in the incidence and severity of healthcare-associated <em>C. difficile</em> infection have occurred since 2000, particularly in patients over age 65 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. As an example, the rate of nosocomial <em>C. difficile</em>&ndash;associated diarrhea in the United States doubled from 31 per 100,000 to 61 per 100,000 between 1996 and 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The rate was significantly higher in patients older than 65 (228 per 100,000). In Canada, the attributable mortality rate of healthcare-associated <em>C. difficile</em> infection increased almost fourfold between 1997 and 2005 (5.7 versus 1.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Another study noted the incidence of <em>C. difficile</em> infection among hospitalized adults in the United States nearly doubled between 2001 and 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p><em>C. difficile</em> carriage occurs in 20 to 50 percent of adults in hospitals and long-term care facilities (the carrier rate among healthy adults is about 3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. About 20 percent of patients with negative admission stool cultures become infected during their hospitalization. Asymptomatic <em>C. difficile</em> carriers are capable of shedding spores of <em>C. difficile</em> and serve as a reservoir for environmental contamination to other hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In a study of 259 asymptomatic patients (ie, without diarrhea) who were admitted to the hospital, 204 (79 percent) were not colonized with <em>C. difficile</em>, 40 (15 percent) were colonized with a toxigenic strain of <em>C. difficile</em>, and 15 (6 percent) were colonized with a non-toxigenic strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Surprisingly, there were no differences between patients colonized with a toxigenic strain of <em>C. difficile</em> and uncolonized patients with regards to recent healthcare or antimicrobial exposures.</p><p>New exposure and colonization by <em>C. difficile</em> are more likely to lead to CDAD, while patients previously colonized with <em>C. difficile</em> are more likely to remain asymptomatic during their hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. The magnitude of this difference was illustrated in a prospective review of 810 hospitalizations, including 618 patients with new <em>C. difficile</em> exposure and 192 patients with previous <em>C. difficile</em> colonization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Newly exposed patients developed CDAD much more frequently than colonized patients (4.5 versus 1.1 percent).</p><p>These phenomena have been observed even when carriers and symptomatic patients are colonized with identical strains. In addition, outbreaks are frequently caused by a single strain of <em>C. difficile</em> even though many bacterial strains may exist in the given hospital environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. As an example, two outbreaks in the same hospital were attributed to a single strain, although 31 distinct strains were isolated from 98 patients in the institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Some potential explanations for these epidemiologic observations are discussed below. Careful adherence to infection control policies is critical to the control of <em>C. difficile</em>. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-prevention-precautions-for-preventing-transmission-of-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection prevention: Precautions for preventing transmission of infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H993068639\"><span class=\"h2\">Community-associated infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of community-associated <em>C. difficile</em> infection (defined as disease in patients not hospitalized in the year prior to diagnosis) is also increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-39</a>].</p><p>In a study of all confirmed cases of CDAD in a Minnesota county from 1991 through 2005, the incidence of both community-acquired and hospital-acquired infection increased dramatically during the study period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Of all 385 cases, 41 percent were community acquired. Patients with community-acquired disease were younger (median age 50 versus 72), healthier, and more likely to be female (76 versus 60 percent). They were also less likely to have antibiotic exposure (78 versus 94 percent), to be on acid suppressants (22 versus 47 percent), to have cancer (17 versus 32 percent), or to have severe infection (20 versus 31 percent). Risk for recurrence did not differ between the two groups (28 and 30 percent).</p><p>Among 984 patients with community-associated CDAD in one multistate study, 36 percent did not receive antibiotics in the 12 weeks prior to diagnosis, 18 percent had no outpatient healthcare exposure, and 40 percent had low-level outpatient exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Proton pump exposure was observed in 31 percent of patients with no antibiotic exposure. There was no association between level of healthcare exposure, food exposure, or animal exposure.</p><p>Unusually severe CDAD has been reported in populations previously thought to be at low risk, including peripartum women and healthy individuals living in the community without a history of antibiotic use, recent hospitalization, or other risk factors for <em>C. difficile</em>&ndash;associated disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/36,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,40,41</a>]. As a result, consideration of <em>C. difficile</em>&ndash;associated infection is warranted even in the absence of antibiotic exposure or recent hospitalization. Retail food products and domestic animals have been postulated as emerging sources of <em>C. difficile</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1825618908\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent <em>C. difficile</em> infection is defined by complete abatement of CDI symptoms while on appropriate therapy, followed by subsequent reappearance of symptoms after treatment has been stopped. Up to 25 percent of patients experience recurrent <em>C. difficile</em> within 30 days of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Less commonly, recurrent CDI can occur as late as three months after discontinuation of treatment. In the United States in 2011, approximately 83,000 patients had at least one recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In the setting of first recurrence, a repeat course of antibiotics often achieves cure.</p><p>Once patients have experienced one recurrence, they are at significantly increased risk for further recurrences (multiply recurrent CDI, or mrCDI). In one retrospective cohort study including more than 45,000 patients with CDI in the United States between 2001 and 2012, the annual incidence of mrCDI increased by 189 percent (from 0.0107 to 0.0309 cases per 1000 person-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Those who developed mrCDI were older (median age 56 versus 49 years), more likely to be female, and more likely to have used antibiotics, proton-pump inhibitors, or corticosteroids within 90 days of CDI diagnosis. Other factors associated with increased risk for mrCDI included chronic kidney disease and diagnosis in a nursing home. The observed increase in incidence of mrCDI was independent of known risk factors for CDI, raising the possibility that the biology of CDI is changing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1756393460\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with <em>C. difficile</em> carriage are a reservoir for environmental contamination in the presence or absence of clinical infection. <em>C difficile</em> is highly transmissible via the fecal-oral route by ingestion of spores. The organism can be cultured readily from the hospital environment, including items in patient rooms as well as the hands, clothing, and stethoscopes of healthcare workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Infection is also transmitted readily between hospital roommates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/25,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,34</a>], and one retrospective study noted receipt of antibiotics by prior bed occupants was associated with increased risk for <em>C. difficile </em>infection<em> </em>in subsequent patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridium-difficile-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathophysiology/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].
