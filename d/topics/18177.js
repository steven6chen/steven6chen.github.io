Important measures for a successful program include designating responsibility for TB infection control and having a written TB infection control plan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-transmission-and-control/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Components of infection control include use of airborne infection isolation and respiratory protection as discussed in the following sections.</p><p>Healthcare workers (HCWs) should be educated regarding TB symptoms, transmission, and prevention. Those who care for patients with respiratory illness should also be trained in effective use of respiratory protection and undergo annual TB screening. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (tuberculosis screening) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1120107481\"><span class=\"h2\">Airborne infection isolation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hospitalized patients with known or suspected active pulmonary TB should be placed in an airborne infection isolation (AII; previously called negative pressure isolation [NPI]) room, if possible.</p><p>An AII room is a single-occupancy patient care room with a ventilation system that generates negative pressure, allowing air to flow into the room but not out of the room into the corridor or to other occupied areas (since air will naturally flow from areas with higher pressure to areas with lower pressure), thereby preventing infectious droplets from escaping the room. The doors and windows of AII rooms must be kept closed to maintain negative pressure, and the pressure should be verified at least daily.</p><p>At least 6 air exchanges per hour are recommended (for construction prior to 2001); for renovations or newer construction, 12 or more exchanges per hour are considered standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-transmission-and-control/abstract/1,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,11</a>].</p><p>Air should be exhausted to the outdoors (where the droplet nuclei are diluted in the outdoor air), far removed from any intake vents, people, or animals (in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local regulations on environmental discharges). If recirculation to general ventilation is unavoidable, air must be passed through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter installed in the exhaust ducts to remove infectious droplets from the air before it is returned to the general circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-transmission-and-control/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Anterooms are useful for maintaining negative pressure. If an anteroom is present, an individual entering the patient's room should open the anteroom door, enter the anteroom, and close the anteroom door. Then the individual should open the AII room door, enter the AII room, and close the AII room door. The anteroom door and the AII room door should not be open simultaneously. All individuals entering the room must wear appropriate respiratory protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-transmission-and-control/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2611305829\" class=\"local\">'Use of masks'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients should be educated about the purpose of the isolation room and be instructed to cover their nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, even while in the isolation room. Procedures should be performed in the AII room whenever possible to minimize exposure of the patient to others in the hospital. If the patient must leave the room, he or she should wear a surgical mask [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-transmission-and-control/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

These are designed to protect the user from exposure to aerosolized droplets within the environment.</p><p>N95 masks filter particles &ge;1 micrometer in diameter with at least 95 percent efficiency given flow rates up to 50 liters per minute. N95 masks must fit to a person's face with less than 10 percent seal leakage. HCWs should be fit tested in order to determine the most appropriate N95 mask size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-transmission-and-control/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. HCWs who are unable to use an N95 mask due to poor fit (for example, individuals with beards or those whose facial structure precludes a tight seal) should use a PAPR.</p><p>The optimal interval for repeat N95 mask fit testing is uncertain. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires annual fit testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-transmission-and-control/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], although this standard was designed to protect workers against industrial aerosols. Evidence for annual N95 mask fit testing in healthcare settings is limited, and good TB control outcomes have been reported by a program that did not perform annual fit testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-transmission-and-control/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2973008362\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with known or suspected TB should be instructed to cover the mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing.

Contact investigation is also warranted if a healthcare worker is newly diagnosed with active, potentially infectious TB and may have exposed others while working prior to diagnosis. In addition, identification of nosocomial TB transmission should prompt review of institutional TB control policy and practices.</p><p>An individual with acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear-positive TB is generally considered to have been infectious beginning three months prior to the first smear-positive sputum or three months prior to the onset of symptoms, whichever is earlier. For individuals with AFB smear-negative TB, the contagious period is considered to have begun one month prior to onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-transmission-and-control/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Patients and healthcare workers with potential exposure should be screened by symptoms and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), unless baseline positive TST or IGRA has been documented previously. If initial screening is negative, testing should be repeated 8 to 10 weeks following the end of the exposure.

One prospective study including two institutions found that, over a two-year period, 19 percent of patients with pulmonary TB were not isolated on their first hospital day and, of patients placed into TB isolation, only 8 percent proved to have TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-transmission-and-control/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Individuals entering airborne isolation rooms did not wear masks in up to 4 percent of cases, and approximately half of individuals wore surgical masks rather than N95 masks even though N95 masks were available.</p><p>In another report including three institutions, patients determined to be at risk for active TB were placed in rooms that were not designed for negative pressure in 19 percent of cases. In addition, some patients were placed in rooms designed for negative pressure although the negative pressure was not activated or functional (11 percent of cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-transmission-and-control/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>These studies highlight the need for regular review of compliance with established infection control policies for the control of TB.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1929534813\"><span class=\"h2\">Surveillance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surveillance should include review of TB incidence and affected groups in the community, with tabulation of cases over at least the previous five years. Collaboration with local or state public health can facilitate this. Lapses in infection control should be identified and corrected. Drug susceptibility data for TB cases should be reviewed. Healthcare workers with risk for exposure to TB should undergo annual serial testing for TB infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (tuberculosis screening) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clues suggestive of potential patient-to-patient transmission include a high proportion of cases with prior hospitalizations in the previous year, a sudden increase in cases (especially multidrug-resistant TB), or multiple TB patients with identical drug-susceptibility patterns (or DNA genotype, if available). Surveillance data in relevant regions should be reviewed for an increase in TST or IGRA conversion.</p><p>Where IGRAs are used for serial testing, studies in HCWs have demonstrated unusually large numbers (up to 6 to 8 percent) of false test conversions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-transmission-and-control/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In such cases, careful review of risks for TB exposure in converters should be performed; if no risk is discovered, the test should be repeated. These same studies showed high rates of reversions to negative in healthcare workers who reported no new TB risk. In circumstances where unsuspected conversions occur, causes for breakdown of infection control interventions should be sought, the possibility of further exposures (patients and HCWs) should be pursued, and the local <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> state public health department should be notified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberculosis-transmission-and-control/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Person-to-person transmission of TB occurs via inhalation of droplet nuclei. Individuals with active untreated pulmonary or laryngeal disease may be contagious, particularly when cavitary disease is present or when the sputum is acid fast-bacilli (AFB) smear positive. Patients with sputum smear-negative, culture-positive pulmonary TB can also transmit infection. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'TB transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospital-based infection control programs are critical for limiting nosocomial transmission of TB. Components of infection control include use of airborne infection isolation (AII) and use of masks. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Components of TB infection control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Care for patients with known or suspected active pulmonary TB begins with clinical assessment for the likelihood of active pulmonary TB, which should be suspected in the circumstances outlined above. (See <a href=\"#H2088948226\" class=\"local\">'Assessing risk for TB'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic evaluation for tuberculosis may be performed in the outpatient or inpatient setting. Hospitalization with airborne precautions is appropriate if social or clinical circumstances preclude outpatient management or if there is public health risk for transmission. (See <a href=\"#H2990893687\" class=\"local\">'Clinical triaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospitalized patients with known or suspected active infectious pulmonary TB should be placed in an AII room if possible; if an AII room is not available, patients should wear a surgical mask and be placed in an enclosed area. An AII room is a single-occupancy patient care room with a ventilation system that generates negative pressure, allowing air to flow into the room but not out of the room, thereby preventing infectious droplets from escaping the room. (See <a href=\"#H1120107481\" class=\"local\">'Airborne infection isolation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1575855909\" class=\"local\">'Initiating airborne precautions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Healthcare workers and visitors should wear an N95 mask while in contact with a patient with known or suspected active TB. N95 masks are designed to protect the user from exposure to aerosolized droplets within the environment. (See <a href=\"#H3358533406\" class=\"local\">'Healthcare workers'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3595879076\" class=\"local\">'Visitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with known or suspected TB should wear a surgical mask when outside AII. Surgical masks are designed to prevent the release of respiratory secretions of the person wearing the mask from entering the environment. Such patients should not wear an N95 mask and need not wear a surgical mask while inside AII. (See <a href=\"#H2973008362\" class=\"local\">'Patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic evaluation for pulmonary TB includes chest radiography, sputum AFB smear and culture, and nucleic acid amplification (NAA) testing. A series of at least three sputum specimens should be collected in 8- to 24-hour intervals for smear and culture (with at least one specimen obtained in the early morning and sent for NAA testing). (See <a href=\"#H566457884\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airborne precautions (including use of AII room and masks) for a patient with suspected infectious TB may be discontinued after the diagnosis of infectious TB has been ruled out (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F108299\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108299 \">algorithm 1</a>) or after a diagnosis of TB has been established with initiation of antituberculous therapy followed by clinical response to treatment (usually four to seven days) and three subsequent negative AFB smears. Discontinuation of airborne precautions should follow applicable public health regulations. (See <a href=\"#H4466522\" class=\"local\">'Discontinuing airborne precautions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected or confirmed cases of TB should be reported promptly to the local public health department in order to assure case management, expedite contact investigation, and plan outpatient follow-up.
