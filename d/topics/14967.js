It is generally assumed, however, that a substantial burden of leukemia cells persists undetected (ie, &quot;minimal residual disease&quot;), leading to relapse within a few weeks or months if no further post-remission therapy (ie, additional consolidation chemotherapy) were administered. However, even when an adult patient is in complete remission (CR) following additional induction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> consolidation therapy, the majority will ultimately relapse, indicating that attainment of CR, as defined below, is not sufficient to guarantee long-term remission <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> &quot;cure.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-therapy-for-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-younger-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction therapy for acute myeloid leukemia in younger adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This review will discuss the subject of minimal residual disease in patients who have been treated for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are in complete remission.

However, conversion from an abnormal to a normal karyotype at the time of first CR is an important prognostic indicator, supporting the use of CRc as a criterion for CR in AML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/remission-criteria-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-monitoring-for-residual-disease/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Other responses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients may fulfill all of the above criteria for CR but may not recover peripheral blood counts to the required level. These are denoted as CRi, or CR with insufficient hematological recovery (platelets or neutrophils). CRp describes a subset of patients with CRi, wherein patients fulfill all criteria for CR except that platelet counts are <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100,000/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/remission-criteria-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-monitoring-for-residual-disease/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>].

Many patients treated on protocol have a bone marrow aspiration repeated every two to three months during the first year after attainment of CR and every three to six months for the next two years. In fact, most relapses are signaled by a decline in the platelet count to abnormal levels or the appearance of leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood smear. In general, for non-protocol patients, a single bone marrow exam performed two to three months after the completion of treatment is likely sufficient as long as the complete blood count remains normal.</p><p>The risk of relapse is highest during the first two years after the end of consolidation chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/remission-criteria-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-monitoring-for-residual-disease/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].

Many documented cases exist in which a bone marrow aspiration was normal at one site and showed leukemia at another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/remission-criteria-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-monitoring-for-residual-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Sensitivity of routine tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard definitions of CR in acute leukemia require that blasts constitute less than 5 percent of the total nonerythroid cells within the bone marrow. Therefore, up to 5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">blasts/100,000</span> nonerythroid cells may still be present in a patient in clinical CR. Other testing limitations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sensitivity of cytogenetics for detecting residual disease is limited to about 5 percent when only 20 to 40 metaphase cells are examined.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, the median lower limit of detection of leukemic blasts by conventional microscopic examination of bone marrow by two experienced cytologists was greater than 1 percent.

While some initial studies have used next generation sequencing to detect gene mutations for MRD analysis, this technique requires further validation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/remission-criteria-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-monitoring-for-residual-disease/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Each method has associated benefits and complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/remission-criteria-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-monitoring-for-residual-disease/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. With each of these methods the presence of cells from the leukemic clone is not, in itself, an indication that relapse is imminent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/remission-criteria-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-monitoring-for-residual-disease/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Such cells might be incapable of division or proliferation, might be able to divide but not mature, or might be held in check by the patient's immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/remission-criteria-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-monitoring-for-residual-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>Numerous technical and practical areas of uncertainty remain regarding MRD monitoring in AML: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type of sample &ndash; Peripheral blood is easy to obtain and lacks immature normal populations of cells that may interfere with analysis by MFC.

The ideal timing as well as sampling interval for MRD monitoring and the length of screening for relapse is unknown and likely differs depending upon the molecular marker used. As an example, AML clones with certain molecular lesions are known to replicate at faster or slower rates than others, resulting in a wide range of elapsed time between the emergence of a positive MRD sample and hematologic relapse. To be effective, a genetic subtype with a short time period between the emergence of MRD and hematologic relapse may require more frequent MRD monitoring than a subtype with a slower progression. Similarly, a genetic subtype that progresses more slowly may require more prolonged MRD monitoring. In addition, the rate of fusion transcript degradation varies by molecular marker.</p><p>While MRD assessment appears to have prognostic value, it is unknown whether MRD assessment will have therapeutic consequences that will improve long-term outcomes. These and other logistical aspects to MRD monitoring must be clarified and validated in rigorous clinical trials before MRD monitoring can become part of the routine follow-up of all patients with AML.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Polymerase chain reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) can be used to look for fusion gene transcripts (eg, BCR-ABL), gene mutations (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">FLT3-LM/ITD),</span> or aberrantly expressed genes (eg, WT1). The leukemic cells must express (or overexpress) a gene not seen in normal cells. RQ-PCR is then used to compare mRNA expression of these targeted genes with that of reference housekeeping genes. RQ-PCR is a potential technique for measuring residual disease in more than half of patients with AML.</p><p>Currently available PCR techniques are able to detect approximately one leukemia cell diluted 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>6</sup> times, or one blast or less per 100,000 nucleated cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/remission-criteria-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-monitoring-for-residual-disease/abstract/6,13,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13,25,26</a>]. As an example, one study that used PCR to estimate the numbers of residual leukemic cells found that the relapse rates for children with &lt;15 or &gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">blasts/100,000</span> mononuclear cells after the end of induction and consolidation therapy were 4 and 47 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/remission-criteria-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-monitoring-for-residual-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Details on the procedure of PCR are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-aspects-of-cytogenetic-analysis-in-hematologic-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General aspects of cytogenetic analysis in hematologic malignancies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The above calculations indicate that routine microscopic determination of clinical complete remission status (&lt;5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">blasts/100,000</span> cells) allows for a residual blast count up to 300 times greater than the number associated with leukemic relapse (&gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">blasts/100,000</span> cells). Even the chance observation of a single blast cell containing an Auer rod (see above) indicates a residual blast count approximately seven times that associated with ultimate relapse. These observations would lead one to conclude that &quot;true&quot; complete remissions must be determined by techniques at least as sensitive as PCR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70804\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70804 \">table 2</a>).

Assessment of MRD at other time points did not provide additional prognostic value above that seen with MRD assessment at first CR, nor did the coexistence of mutations usually associated with poor prognosis (eg, <em>FLT3-ITD</em> and <em>DNMT3A</em>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, among 152 patients with <em>NPM1</em>-mutated AML who were treated in the Acute Leukemia French Association 0702 trial, those who did not achieve a four-log reduction in <em>NPM1</em> had a higher cumulative incidence of relapse (hazard ratio 5.8) and shorter overall survival (hazard ratio 11) compared with those who did reach that benchmark [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/remission-criteria-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-monitoring-for-residual-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While these results support the prognostic value of MRD in non-APL AML, the use of <em>NPM1</em> and other markers for MRD testing needs to be confirmed using validated techniques before using this single measure as a sole determinant of post-remission therapy.</p><p/><p>There are many practical issues that complicate the incorporation of MRD assays into the care of patients with non-APL AML. MRD assays must be standardized, and each individual marker used for MRD assessment needs a rigorous validation. As an example, t(8;21) and <em>DNMT3A</em> are unlikely to be good markers of MRD since they are also prevalent in preleukemic conditions and thus do not adequately predict for relapse of active disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/remission-criteria-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-monitoring-for-residual-disease/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. There is also uncertainty regarding the best time to measure MRD. Measurement immediately after remission induction provides information about the chemotherapy-sensitivity of the bulk of malignant cells, but this time point is unlikely to inform about residual subclones that may be more resistant. The following examples illustrate the complexity of incorporating MRD assessment into practice:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with t(8;21) who have been treated for AML have had positive evidence for the <span class=\"nowrap\">AML1/ETO</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(AML1/MTG8)</span> fusion gene by RT-PCR for as long as eight years without relapsing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/remission-criteria-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-monitoring-for-residual-disease/abstract/21,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,48</a>]. On the other hand, patients who become RT-PCR negative have a low rate of relapse and are probably cured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/remission-criteria-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-monitoring-for-residual-disease/abstract/20,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,49,50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 45 patients with <em>DNMT3A</em> positive AML, 14 patients had detectable <em>DNMT3A</em> mutations in remission samples up to eight years after the initial AML diagnosis, without other molecular markers of AML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/remission-criteria-in-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-monitoring-for-residual-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

Thus, it is generally assumed that a substantial burden of leukemia cells persists undetected (ie, &quot;minimal residual disease&quot;), leading to relapse within a few weeks or months if no further post-remission therapy (ie, additional consolidation chemotherapy) were administered. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CR is defined by International Working Group criteria using morphologic and clinical data (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60024\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60024 \">table 1</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Difficulties in defining CR'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Techniques employing real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and multiparameter flow cytometry techniques are significantly more sensitive for detecting the presence or absence of minimal residual disease (MRD) than morphology or cytogenetics.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Identifying minimal residual disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PCR analysis is routinely used to confirm a CR in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Once a molecular CR is achieved, many clinicians follow patients periodically with RT-PCR for the PML-RARalpha fusion transcript in order to monitor for relapse. Such monitoring is likely only to be useful if done frequently with a planned intervention as soon as a positive signal is seen. For patients with APL, we consider patients to have relapsed disease if, after attainment of complete molecular remission, subsequent analyses confirm the loss of such molecular remission. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Use in APL'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Monitoring response during maintenance'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of MRD monitoring in patients with non-APL AML is less clear. Decisions on whether to continue, alter, or resume therapy cannot at present be based solely upon a positive signal with RT-PCR. The cut-off values examined in the published literature have been derived from retrospective analyses, and appropriate prospective validation is needed to confirm these results. The detection of cells from the leukemic clone is not, in itself, an indication that relapse is imminent. Such cells might be incapable of division or proliferation, might be able to divide but not mature, or might be held in check by the patient's immune system.
