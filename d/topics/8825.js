Since then, great progress has been made in developing immunosuppression regimens to prevent acute and chronic rejection (bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome) of the lung allograft and to reduce the risk of opportunistic infection, a major side effect of immunosuppression. </p><p>The protocols for immunosuppressive therapy following lung transplantation can be divided into three general categories: induction, maintenance, and treatment of rejection. Strategies for induction of immunosuppression in the lung transplant recipient will be reviewed here. Maintenance immunosuppression, the immunology of solid organ transplantation, and the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic lung transplant rejection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance immunosuppression following lung transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transplantation-immunobiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transplantation immunobiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of acute lung transplant rejection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic lung transplant rejection: Bronchiolitis obliterans&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90189474\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three general principles govern immunosuppressive therapy following lung transplantation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first principle is that immune reactivity and the tendency toward graft rejection are highest in the first six months after graft implantation and decrease with time. Thus, most regimens employ the highest intensity of immunosuppression immediately after surgery and decrease the intensity of therapy over the first year, eventually settling on the lowest maintenance levels of immunosuppression that are compatible with preventing graft rejection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second principle is that using low doses of several drugs with non-overlapping toxicities is preferable to higher (and more toxic) doses of fewer drugs whenever feasible. Combination regimens also help to block the many components of the complex immunological cascade that leads to allograft rejection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The third principle is to avoid over-immunosuppression, because it leads to undesirable adverse effects, such as susceptibility to infection and malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection in the solid organ transplant recipient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Development of malignancy following solid organ transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The immunosuppressive strategies used in lung transplantation have capitalized on the experiences with transplantation of other solid organs. However, there is no consensus regarding the optimal regimen for immunosuppression following lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, none of the immunosuppressive medications is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in lung transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21538944\"><span class=\"h1\">INDUCTION THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Induction therapy is the brief utilization of a potent immunosuppressive agent in the immediate post-transplant period to reduce the initial robust immune response of T cells to the transplanted organ. Induction agents focus on depletion of T cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> interruption of T cell activation and proliferation, as T cells are the primary mediators of rejection. T cell recognition of antigens on the transplanted lung initiates calcineurin-mediated stimulation of the transcription, translation, and secretion of interleukin-2 (IL-2), an essential growth factor for T-cell proliferation. Interruption of IL-2 activity suppresses T cell proliferation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transplantation-immunobiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transplantation immunobiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Induction agents can be classified into two groups: monoclonal agents (eg, IL-2 antagonists, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>, and muromonab-CD3 which is no longer available), and polyclonal agents (eg, anti-lymphocyte and anti-thymocyte globulins) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74258\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74258 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The administration of high-dose glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> 500 to 1000 mg intravenous) intraoperatively just before perfusion of the lung allograft is designed to reduce the risk of reperfusion injury. It is generally not considered part of induction therapy, although it probably contributes to the initial immunosuppression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-transplantation-procedure-and-postoperative-management#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung transplantation: Procedure and postoperative management&quot;, section on 'Initiation of immunosuppression'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1227773\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications and contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of induction therapy remains controversial in lung transplantation although an increasing number of transplant programs are using some form of induction therapy. According to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) registry, the use of induction therapy for lung transplantation increased from 49 percent in 2004 to 70 percent in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In some centers, induction therapy may be tailored to the individual patient. For example, older lung transplant recipients (&gt;65 years) or patients who are at higher risk of infection (eg, CMV serologic status of <span class=\"nowrap\">+donor/-recipient),</span> induction therapy may be withheld. In others such as highly sensitized patients (ie, those who have preformed panel reactive antibodies [PRA] to the donor MHC antigens), induction therapy may be given.

Thus, these agents inhibit IL-2 mediated proliferation and differentiation of T cells, but do not deplete them. Basiliximab contains a greater proportion of murine antibody than daclizumab and also has a shorter half-life and lower receptor saturation than daclizumab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. According to the ISHLT registry, induction therapy with an IL-2R-antagonist was used in 61 percent of lung transplants performed from January to June 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=basiliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Basiliximab</a> is administered intraoperatively or immediately following lung transplant and again on the fourth posttransplant day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74258\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74258 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The dose for adults and children weighing over 35 kg is 20 mg, infused intravenously over 20 to 30 minutes. Being humanized, basiliximab is generally well-tolerated and does not cause the cytokine release syndrome typical of muromonab-CD3 and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>.

Alemtuzumab leads to depletion of T cells through complement-mediated and direct cellular cytotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Alemtuzumab has been used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, lymphoid malignancies, graft-versus-host disease, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It was first used as an induction agent in solid organ transplantation in 1998 and was used as an induction agent in approximately 6 percent of lung transplantations performed in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. As of September 2012, alemtuzumab is no longer commercially available in the United States and Europe; a restricted distribution program has been established by the manufacturer to allow access for appropriate patients. </p><p>The usual dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> for induction of immunosuppression is 30 mg infused over two hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74258\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74258 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Like OKT3, alemtuzumab can cause a cytokine release syndrome with the first dose, characterized by fever and in more severe cases, by hypotension, hypoxemia, and end-organ dysfunction. This reaction is more modest than that seen with OKT3 and can be effectively prevented or attenuated by preemptive administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenously, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> 50 mg orally or intravenously, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> 500 to 1000 mg orally 30 minutes prior to initiation of alemtuzumab infusion. The prevention and management of acute infusion reactions to alemtuzumab are discussed separately.

Because the target CD52 antigen is also present on B cells, alemtuzumab leads to B cell lymphopenia as well, although of a shorter time period, typically about three months. Use of alemtuzumab for induction or treatment of acute rejection has been noted to be an independent risk factor for opportunistic infection in a large study of 547 organ transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage has been reported with the use of alemtuzumab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25845309\"><span class=\"h3\">Anti-thymocyte globulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-lymphocyte/anti-thymocyte</span> globulins are polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations created from horses (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithymocyte-globulin-equine-atgam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">horse antithymocyte globulin</a>, equine ATG, eATG, Atgam) or rabbits (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithymocyte-globulin-rabbit-derived-thymoglobulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabbit antithymocyte globulin</a>, rabbit ATG, rATG, Thymoglobulin) with antibodies against human T cells. Antithymocyte globulins act through the Fc receptor and other proteins on the surface of T cells to deplete cytotoxic T cells. With the introduction of IL-2R antagonists, few centers continue to utilize anti-thymocyte globulin preparations for induction.</p><p>The efficacy and safety of ATG-Fresenius S (ATG-F), given as a single 5 or 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> dose, were compared with placebo in a randomized trial of 223 lung transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The primary endpoint was a composite of death, graft loss, acute rejection, and loss to follow-up at 12 months after transplantation. When an interim analysis found that the lower ATG-F dose was not efficacious, enrollment in that arm was discontinued. At 12 months, the efficacy failure rate was not different between the 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> dose of ATG-F and placebo (40 versus 37 percent). Furthermore, ATG-F was not associated with a significant reduction in acute cellular rejection, graft loss, or death, compared with placebo. Thus, induction therapy with a single dose of either 5 or 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of ATG-F is not advised.</p><p>The typical regimen for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithymocyte-globulin-rabbit-derived-thymoglobulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabbit antithymocyte globulin</a> (Thymoglobulin) is 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> administered intravenously on day one and then two or three additional doses given 24 hours apart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74258\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74258 \">table 1</a>). The initial dose is infused over at least six hours through a high-flow vein; subsequent doses are administered over at least four hours. In general, lymphocyte subsets (CD3 &gt;5 percent) are followed to determine whether to administer the subsequent daily doses. The typical regimen for administering <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithymocyte-globulin-equine-atgam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">horse antithymocyte globulin</a> (Atgam) is intravenous administration of 5 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for the first 1 to 14 days following lung transplantation.</p><p>Many patients have an acute reaction of fever, rigors, myalgias, rash, and tachycardia to initial administration.

However, it is currently not used as induction therapy in lung transplantation due to the severe toxicities associated with this drug and is not available in the United States or Europe. </p><p>OKT3 binds to the T cell receptor-CD3 complex. This binding causes a reversible antigenic modification of the CD3 complex, leading to depletion of T cells, except for relative sparing of T regulatory cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

According to data from the ISHLT registry, the use of any induction therapy compared with no induction therapy is associated with a slight but statistically significant improvement in survival contingent upon survival to 14 days post transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The difference between the groups is not apparent until at least a year following transplant. However, the small benefit of induction therapy should be balanced with the increased risks of this therapy including increased infections as well as increased costs.</p><p>Several smaller studies have compared the effects of various agents on survival after lung transplantation. However, the results of these studies have been somewhat conflicting, in part due to the study design and small size. In a more rigorous, but still retrospective, analysis of the ISHLT data on 3970 adult lung recipients, graft survival at four years was better among those who received an IL-2 receptor antagonist (64 percent) than those treated with antithymocyte globulin (60 percent) or no induction (57 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

There was no difference in graft survival between the groups at eight years (RATG: 36 percent; control: 23 percent; p = 0.48).

However, the authors caution that the number of patients was relatively small and all identified studies were at high risk for methodological bias. Thus, definitive endorsement of induction therapy, and of a particular agent, awaits future performance of large prospective, randomized trials. The current preference for IL-2 antagonists among centers employing induction protocols reflects their more favorable safety profile rather than demonstrated superior efficacy. (See <a href=\"#H21538979\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of induction therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>IL-2R antagonists were used in 45 percent of lung transplantations performed between January 2004 and June 2016, in contrast with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> and <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-lymphocyte/anti-thymocyte</span> globulin, which were used in 6 and 8 percent of recipients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-immunosuppression-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15072184\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opportunistic infection is a major side effect of immunosuppression for organ transplantation.

In this era of personalized medicine, choosing and tailoring an appropriate induction agent for a given individual may ultimately improve outcomes. This individualized approach would require better prediction of a patient&rsquo;s risk for infection and rejection as well as a better understanding of the net effect of immunosuppression for a given individual. In addition, performance of large prospective trials will be essential in defining the overall benefit of induction therapy in this population. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21539084\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Induction therapy refers to the brief utilization of a potent immunosuppressive agent in the immediate post-transplant period to reduce the initial robust immune response to the transplanted organ. The decision to use specific induction immunosuppression and the choice of agent vary according to transplant center experience and recipient characteristics (eg, degree of pretransplant sensitization, risk of posttransplant infection); there is no clear consensus regarding the optimal regimen. (See <a href=\"#H21538944\" class=\"local\">'Induction therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rationale behind induction immunosuppression is two-fold. First, induction regimens are designed to promote early and potent immunosuppression, as the tendency toward graft rejection is highest early (within the first three to six months) after graft implantation. Second, potent induction may enable a less toxic maintenance regimen to be successful. (See <a href=\"#H90189474\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The induction agents that are used for lung transplantation include the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) antagonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basiliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">basiliximab</a>), the anti-T and B cell antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>, and antithymocyte globulin. Information about the administration of these agents and their potential adverse effects is provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74258\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74258 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2536653\" class=\"local\">'Induction agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data on efficacy are insufficient to permit recommendation of a particular induction agent. Because the IL-2 receptor antagonists have a more favorable safety profile, they have emerged as the most commonly employed induction therapy. (See <a href=\"#H21538958\" class=\"local\">'Basiliximab/daclizumab'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21538979\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of induction therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opportunistic infection is a major side effect of immunosuppression for organ transplantation.
