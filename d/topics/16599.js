Only approximately 20 percent of individuals survive long enough following injury to be transported to the hospital and treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The<strong> </strong>most significant advance in the past 50 years for the treatment of thoracic aortic disease is endovascular stent-grafting. Compared with other etiologies that are treated with thoracic endovascular stenting, such as thoracic aneurysm, patients with blunt aortic injury tend to be younger with anatomic features that can present challenges for the placement of endograft devices, which were not designed for this indication. </p><p>The surgical and endovascular options for repair of the traumatic thoracic aortic disruption will be reviewed. The diagnosis and management of blunt thoracic aortic injury is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt thoracic aortic injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13962151\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR AND TIMING OF REPAIR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aortic repair for blunt aortic injury is indicated for patients with injury Grades II, III, and IV. The diagnosis, grading and indications for repair, as well as timing of repair, are discussed elsewhere. Aortic repair is generally not indicated for patients with Type I injury (intima only), but may become necessary if the injury progresses. Aortic repair may be delayed in patients with a high surgical risk, due to comorbidities, challenging aortic anatomy, or coexistent injuries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury#H2669606\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt thoracic aortic injury&quot;, section on 'Aortic injury grading'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury#H2669935\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt thoracic aortic injury&quot;, section on 'Approach to management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13962182\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOVASCULAR VERSUS OPEN SURGICAL REPAIR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The<strong> </strong>most significant surgical advance in the past 50 years for the treatment of thoracic aortic disease is endovascular stent grafting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Based upon observational data that demonstrate improved perioperative outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/5-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-14</a>], we agree with major trauma society and vascular society guidelines that suggest endovascular rather than open surgical repair for patients with indications for aortic repair and anatomy that is suitable for thoracic stent grafting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. This preference places a higher value on preventing perioperative mortality and morbidity, such as spinal cord ischemia, compared with endograft complications that lead to reintervention and uncertain long-term outcomes. It is important to keep in mind, though, that patients with blunt aortic injury may be more suited for one approach or another depending on local institutional resources and other issues such as the presence, location, and type of associated injuries, the location of the aortic injury and diameter of the aorta, the patient's life expectancy, and likelihood of cooperation with long-term follow-up in the event of endovascular repair. (See <a href=\"#H2093847775\" class=\"local\">'Issues to consider'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2093847239\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparative morbidity and mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is unlikely that randomized trials will ever be performed comparing open and endovascular repair for treatment of blunt aortic injury. Comparisons of the rates of major perioperative morbidity and mortality from retrospective reviews and pooled data suggest a benefit for endovascular repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/5-14,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-14,17,18</a>].</p><p>The American Association for the Society on Trauma (AAST)-1 study evaluated 274 cases of blunt aortic injury from 50 trauma centers over a two-and-a-half-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A variety of open surgical techniques were used and overall mortality was 31 percent. Approximately 10 years later, the AAST-2 study found a modest reduction in mortality to 23.5 percent for patients undergoing open surgical repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. During that time period, thoracic endovascular grafting was introduced and mortality associated with it was significantly lower at 7.2 percent compared with open repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In the RESCUE study (endovascular aortic repair using Valiant Captivia for blunt thoracic aortic injury), a nonrandomized multicenter study, perioperative (30 day all-cause) mortality was 8 percent (4 of 50 patients) and one-year all-cause mortality was 12 percent (6 of 50 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p>Separate systematic reviews have confirmed the trend identified in these studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/5-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-12</a>]. The later of these systematic reviews compared the outcomes of 7768 patients, drawn from 27 retrospective studies and 112 case series, treated with endovascular or open repair, and in some cases, with no repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Overall mortality was significantly lower for patients who underwent endovascular compared with open repair or no repair (open repair: 9 versus 19 percent; no repair: 9 versus 46 percent). Injury severity score correlated with mortality for open surgical repair, but not for endovascular repair. In a subsequent review from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) that included 37 nonrandomized studies, the risk of death was significantly reduced for endovascular compared with open surgical repair (risk ratio [RR] 0.49, 95% CI 0.36-0.66), as was the risk for paraplegia (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17&ndash;0.69) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Other institutional reviews have shown similar improved outcomes for endovascular repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/20-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-37</a>]. At the author's institution, reductions in mortality rates for endovascular repair have also been seen, and also significantly shorter lengths of stay, less need for blood transfusion, and less need for postoperative tracheostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2093847775\"><span class=\"h2\">Issues to consider</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there is preference for endovascular repair when anatomically suitable, and provided institutional resources are available to support the endeavor, for some patients, the choice may not be as clear. An individualized approach takes into account the patient's specific injuries, age, anatomy, and other comorbidities. Open surgery, which is durable and does not require ongoing graft surveillance, may be a better option for some patients with an acceptable surgical risk, and is the only option for patients with anatomic features that preclude endovascular repair.

The number of patients treated with endovascular repair of blunt traumatic injuries has increased dramatically. In the AAST-1 study, stent graft repair was selected in 65 percent of cases of aortic trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p>Endovascular repair for blunt thoracic aortic injury is performed in a similar manner to the endovascular repair of thoracic aortic aneurysm, which is described in detail elsewhere. Technical success rates for blunt aortic injury vary widely, ranging from 10 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Five stent-graft systems for thoracic aortic repair are available for use in the United States and are listed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TAG and Conformable TAG (CTAG) graft</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Zenith TX2 </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Talent Thoracic Stent-Graft System </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Valiant Thoracic Stent-Graft System</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bolton relay </p><p/><p>The essential features of these devices, and studies demonstrating their safety and efficacy, are discussed in detail elsewhere. A number of investigational devices are in early phases. With improvements in stent-graft design, morbidity related to stent-graft placement for blunt aortic injury has decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-devices-for-thoracic-aortic-repair\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular devices for thoracic aortic repair&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thoracic endograft devices were originally designed for the treatment of nonruptured aneurysms of the thoracic aorta. The listed devices have technical advantages and disadvantages, and all are associated with technical success rates approaching 100 percent when used to treat focal lesions located within the descending portion of a nontortuous thoracic aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. However, thoracic stent-graft devices were not specifically designed for this indication and many are not suited to the narrow, acutely-angled aortic arch typical of the younger patient who presents with blunt aortic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. </p><p>Narrow thoracic aortas (&le;17.5 mm) cannot be accommodated by any of the available thoracic endograft devices with the appropriate degree of over-sizing to ensure proximal fixation. In one study, the average aortic diameter in patients with blunt aortic injury was approximately 23 mm with a range of 19 to 30 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A next generation device, the Conformable TAG graft (CTAG), has been approved in the United States for the treatment of blunt aortic injury, and was designed to conform to smaller, more tortuous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tapered thoracic aortic anatomy to allow treatment of nonaneurysmal pathologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The CTAG is available in a minimal 21 mm diameter, which can accommodate an aorta that is 17.5 mm with 20 percent over-sizing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Some have suggested that over-sizing the endograft for this indication is not as crucial as with aneurysmal disease, and that 10 percent over-sizing should be adequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], particularly given that it appears that the aorta tends to dilate in response. (See <a href=\"#H2093837510\" class=\"local\">'Graft surveillance'</a> below.)</p><p>An alternative approach uses abdominal aortic devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/38,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,51</a>]. However, these devices are shorter in length, requiring more than one device for adequate coverage, and the delivery system is a shorter length. None of the abdominal devices are suited to the tight angulation of the aortic arch in the younger patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2073945\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic criteria for endograft repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following criteria are mandatory for thoracic endograft placement:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic diameter at proximal landing zone &ge;17.5 mm </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate proximal and distal landing zones (&ge;2 cm in<sup> </sup>length)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimal calcification at the<sup> </sup>fixation sites</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal aortic lesion </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location in the descending thoracic aorta</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No significant<sup> </sup>tortuosity of the thoracic aorta</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No intraluminal thrombus </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate diameter and quality of access vessels (sheath size depends upon the graft chosen)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H170894103\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for specific measures to protect the spinal cord are similar to thoracic endovascular repair for aneurysmal disease. However, for blunt aortic injury occurring in the proximal portion of the descending thoracic aorta, spinal drainage is generally not needed. Spinal fluid drainage should be considered if the entire thoracic aorta requires endograft coverage, there has been a preexisting repair of the infrarenal aorta, or the area of coverage will include the distal third of the thoracic aorta. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta#H440771363\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular repair of the thoracic aorta&quot;, section on 'Spinal cord ischemia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H255247707\"><span class=\"h2\">Device placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient should be placed in a supine position. On occasion, conversion to an open thoracotomy may be needed, and thus preemptive placement on a bean bag (used for thoracotomy positioning) minimizes the delay. Arterial cutdown of the common femoral artery is usually performed, though percutaneous access has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Once the common femoral artery is exposed, the access sheath is placed into the common femoral artery and a guidewire is advanced through the sheath into the proximal aorta. If the femoral artery is judged too small for the stent-graft delivery system (via imaging or on table assessment), iliac or aortic conduits can be used; however, conduits in the pelvis should be avoided in patients with pelvic fractures or pelvic hematomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Aortography can be performed via a catheter placed percutaneously through the contralateral groin (or brachial artery) to confirm the anatomy and define the landing zones for the device. The device is positioned across the area of pathology by advancing it over a stiff guidewire (eg, Lunderquist). The position of the device is confirmed with repeat aortography. Prior to device deployment, the patient's blood pressure should be lowered to lessen the arterial impulse and minimize the potential for misplacement during deployment. The device is then deployed, thus excluding the perforated site from the circulation. A completion aortogram should be performed to confirm patency of the endograft and successful exclusion of the area of disruption (ie, no endoleaks). The guidewires and introducer sheaths are removed and the arteriotomies are repaired.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H255247739\"><span class=\"h3\">Heparinization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic anticoagulation is typically used during the placement of endovascular grafts to reduce the risk of thrombus formation within the thoracic aorta and around the sheath site, which could lead to distal embolization and possibly stroke. However, in patients with traumatic aortic injury, significant associated injuries, such as intracranial hemorrhage or splenic injury, may contraindicate anticoagulation. Under these circumstances, endovascular repair of the thoracic aorta without the use of heparin has been used without adverse consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. For patients with traumatic aortic injuries and a contraindication to heparin, particularly if the aortic injury appears to be in an anatomically favorable location, we proceed with endograft repair without systemic heparinization. This approach may also allow earlier intervention. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13963500\"><span class=\"h3\">Subclavian coverage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An adequate proximal landing zone may require coverage of the left subclavian artery, particularly in patients with blunt aortic injury, for whom the injury is typically located at the level of the aortic isthmus. However, positioning the top of the endograft proximal to the origin of the left subclavian artery can lead to poor apposition of the graft along the inside curvature of the aortic arch, particularly in younger patients who have a narrower aorta. This may increase the risk of endoleak or endograft collapse. (See <a href=\"#H255247576\" class=\"local\">'Endograft-related complications'</a> below.)</p><p>In our experience, complete or partial coverage of the origin of the left subclavian artery is needed in approximately 20 percent of cases, but the need can be higher among those with complicated injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/38,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,56</a>]. Although coverage of the subclavian artery origin is usually well tolerated, symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency can develop in patients with a dominant left vertebral artery, and coronary steal syndrome can develop in patients who have a left internal mammary coronary bypass graft. These patients may benefit from extraanatomic bypass (carotid subclavian bypass) prior to coverage of the left subclavian with the stent-graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subclavian-steal-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subclavian steal syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-repair-of-the-thoracic-aorta#H144778392\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular repair of the thoracic aorta&quot;, section on 'Arch vessel bypass'</a>.)</p><p>A systematic review identified 94 studies that evaluated subclavian coverage during endovascular repair of blunt aortic injury in 1704 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. There were no cases of left upper extremity ischemia, stroke, spinal cord ischemia, endoleak, or death, when the left subclavian artery was revascularized, or when the left subclavian origin was only partially covered. By contrast, total coverage of the left subclavian artery without revascularization increased the incidence of left arm ischemia (4 versus 0 percent), stroke (1.2 versus 0.2 percent), and the need for an additional procedure (2.9 versus 0.9 percent). In a prospective study, patients presenting with blunt aortic injury and a &lt;2 cm distance between the site of rupture and the left subclavian artery underwent intentional coverage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Among 31 patients, nine developed upper extremity ischemic symptoms, which was significantly related to left vertebral artery diameter &lt;3 mm. The majority of patients with ischemic symptoms had significant symptomatic improvement; overall, two patients required reintervention at 48 months follow-up.</p><p>An alternative to subclavian coverage is the use of fenestrated grafts, originally described for repair of thoracic aortic aneurysm.

Several studies have investigated the alterations in aortic diameter that occur as a result of endograft placement for blunt aortic injury. One retrospective study compared pre-and postprocedure imaging in 70 injured patients who received a CTAG device (see <a href=\"#H255247669\" class=\"local\">'Endografts and sizing'</a> above) with 54 patients who underwent endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The proximal and distal aortic neck demonstrated remodeling with a positive correlation between the increase in aortic diameter and the amount of endograft over-sizing. Mean increases in proximal and distal neck diameters between pretreatment and 30-day imaging were significantly greater in traumatic injury patients than in aneurysm patients. In both study populations, smaller pretreatment aortic neck diameters showed a larger change in neck diameter compared with larger pretreatment aortic diameters. These studies support the need for ongoing endograft surveillance.</p><p>The optimal program for thoracic endograft surveillance is still being defined. Routine surveillance is typically performed in the postoperative period (eg, one month, six months), then annually with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest, but routine surveillance varies by institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The need for ongoing follow-up is important when selecting patients for endovascular repair, particularly in the trauma population and, for some patients, an inability to comply with graft surveillance may be a deciding factor favoring open surgical repair. (See <a href=\"#H2093847775\" class=\"local\">'Issues to consider'</a> above.)</p><p>The need for lifelong graft surveillance in patients who have undergone endovascular repair for blunt aortic injury has been challenged by some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. Over the course of time, radiation exposure may become a significant issue, particularly in young patients who will be subjected to numerous CT scans over their lifetime. For patients who have demonstrated stable-appearing endograft repairs, the interval between studies can be lengthened to reduce the risks associated with repeated radiation exposure. Alternatives to chest CT are magnetic resonance (MR) angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>], and transesophageal echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury#H1759284759\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt thoracic aortic injury&quot;, section on 'Immediate versus delayed repair'</a>.)</p><p>Open repair of traumatic aortic injury is similar to open repair of thoracic aortic aneurysm with some notable exceptions which are discussed below. Open repair of thoracic aortic aneurysm is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of thoracic aortic aneurysm in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Open surgical repair of the thoracic aorta is performed under general anesthesia using a double lumen tube. One-lung ventilation allows collapse of the left lung and facilitates access to the aorta. It is important to note that patients with severe associated right chest or lung injuries may not tolerate one-lung ventilation. Delayed repair or endovascular repair may be warranted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=one-lung-ventilation-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;One lung ventilation: General principles&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The extent of the thoracotomy incision is based upon the location of the pathology. As examples, in blunt aortic injury, the aortic disruption usually occurs at the aortic isthmus, and thus, a fourth intercostal space thoracotomy incision should be performed. More extensive involvement may require sternotomy or thoracoabdominal exposure.</p><p>Once the chest is entered, the site of pathology is identified and any bleeding should be controlled with direct pressure while an aortic clamp is placed just distal to the left subclavian artery. If the aortic disruption is in close proximity to the left subclavian artery, the clamp will need to be placed between the left common carotid artery and the left subclavian artery. In some cases, such as a small traumatic tear, the aorta can be repaired primarily; however, most patients require the placement of an interposition graft (eg, Dacron). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H170892422\"><span class=\"h2\">Perfusion techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clamping the thoracic aorta compromises the blood supply to the spinal cord. Active perfusion of the distal aorta, which is a source of flow to the spinal arteries, has reduced the incidence of paraplegia associated with repair of blunt thoracic aortic injury to approximately 2 percent, with some centers reporting no spinal cord complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/66-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-71</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H170894764\" class=\"local\">'Spinal cord ischemia'</a> below.)</p><p>In the early experience of open thoracic aortic repair for blunt thoracic aortic injury, most procedures were performed with a clamp-and-sew technique. However, even a short cross clamp time (&lt;30 minutes) did not prevent spinal cord ischemia and neurologic deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/13,72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,72-74</a>].

An older technique, passive perfusion, in which a heparin-bonded shunt is placed to divert blood from the proximal aorta above the site of clamping to the distal aorta below the site of the clamping, has been supplanted by active perfusion techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. </p><p>Active perfusion can be achieved using one of two techniques: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left atrial-femoral bypass &ndash; Left atrial-femoral bypass is accomplished by placing a cannula into the left atrium (or pulmonary vein). The oxygenated blood is pumped and delivered to the distal aorta via a cannula placed into the left common femoral artery. This simple circuit can be performed with a relatively small dose of heparin (approximately 5000 units). One of the disadvantages of this technique is that it relies on oxygenation of the blood in a patient using a single lung. The level of oxygenation may not be sufficient in patients with concomitant pulmonary contusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Femoral venous-to-femoral arterial cardiopulmonary bypass &ndash; An alternative technique places a cannula in the femoral vein and advanced to the right atrium. A second cannula is placed in the femoral artery. This technique is known as femoral venous-to-femoral arterial cardiopulmonary bypass (venoarterial bypass). With this technique, deoxygenated blood is drawn from the cannula in the right atrium and circulated through a cardiopulmonary bypass machine to oxygenate the blood before returning it to the patient via the femoral artery. Advantages of the venoarterial bypass include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>It allows simultaneous cooling of the patient, which may augment spinal cord protection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Oxygenation of the blood is independent of the lung, which is preferred in patients with concomitant lung injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Systemic heparin administration can be minimized by using heparin-coated tubing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. </p><p/><p>In one 30-year retrospective review, paraplegia did not occur in 73 patients who underwent repair of the thoracic aorta for traumatic injury using venoarterial bypass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. In another retrospective review, 138 consecutive patients were treated over a 35-year period and repaired with a short interposition graft using some form of circulatory support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. The average age was 27 years and 91 percent had associated injuries (mean injury severity score [ISS] 44). Death occurred in <span class=\"nowrap\">7/138</span> patients (5 percent).

Although less common, late complications related to open repair can occur (eg, coarctation, aneurysmal degeneration) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H170894764\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal cord ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal cord ischemia may result in paraparesis or paraplegia. Although the incidence of spinal cord complications has steadily diminished with the increased use of active perfusion techniques, paraplegia remains a significant concern when open repair is used to repair the thoracic aorta. The incidence of paraplegia ranges between 0 and 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/5,14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14,19</a>]. The American Association for the Society on Trauma AAST-2 study reported an overall reduction in the incidence of paraplegia from 8.7 to 1.6 percent (open and endovascular repair). This reduction was correlated to a 20 percent increase in the use of spinal cord perfusion techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The incidence of paraplegia associated with endovascular repair decreased to 0.8 percent over that same time period. In a systematic review that included 7768 patients undergoing open surgical or endovascular repair for thoracic aortic injury, the risk of spinal cord ischemia was significantly lower for endovascular (3 versus 9 percent) versus open repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108701577\"><span class=\"h2\">Stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perioperative stroke is a potentially devastating complication of repair of blunt aortic injury.

An earlier systematic review of 33 retrospective studies included 370 patients who underwent endovascular repair and 329 open repairs for blunt aortic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Stroke occurred in 1 percent of patients following endovascular repair and 4.5 percent of patients undergoing open surgical repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

In one of these studies, the incidence of stroke increased with subclavian coverage both with and without left subclavian revascularization compared with no left subclavian coverage (with revascularization: 4.7 versus 2.7 percent; without revascularization: 4.1 versus 2.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].

Improvements in the design of thoracic endovascular grafts that take into account the anatomy of the nonaneurysmal aorta, particularly in younger patients, should help reduce the incidence of device-related complications. In one retrospective review, freedom from intervention at five years was estimated at 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. </p><p>Most endografts that have complications can be salvaged with endovascular techniques such that conversion to open repair is not necessary.</p><p>Device complications can be related to endograft under-sizing, excessive over-sizing, or related to device deployment. As an example, positioning the endograft with its leading edge perpendicular to blood flow in the transverse aortic arch can lead to device collapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/86,88-90\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,88-90</a>]. Efforts to avoid over-sizing can lead to inappropriate under-sizing. Under-sizing may also be the result of an underestimation of the diameter of the aorta in the face of systemic hypotension. The highly elastic thoracic aorta recoils, leading to measurements on computed tomography (CT) that can underestimate the true aortic diameter at normal blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Intravascular ultrasound during endovascular repair may be helpful for confirming aortic diameter in real-time as the patient is being resuscitated; however, availability of this modality is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/13,92-94\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,92-94</a>]. </p><p>In spite of the short-term benefits of decreased mortality and paraplegia, the long-term durability of thoracic endograft devices for the repair of nonaneurysmal pathologies is unknown. Many patients with blunt aortic injury are young, and it is unknown how the endograft will respond to normal aging. The thoracic aorta tends to enlarge with age, but it is uncertain just how the aorta adjacent the endograft responds and whether any subsequent aortic dilation will result in endoleak. (See <a href=\"#H2093837510\" class=\"local\">'Graft surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p>Endoleak in the nonaneurysmal aorta is defined as persistent flow around the graft in the native aorta following endovascular repair. In the AAST-2 study of blunt aortic injury, the incidence of endoleak (mostly type I) was 14.4 percent, of which one-third subsequently required open repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Endovascular repair is associated with significantly decreased mortality and a lower incidence of spinal cord ischemia compared with open surgical repair. However, the long-term outcomes of thoracic endovascular repair, particularly in younger patients, are not known. Reintervention following endovascular repair is needed in up to 20 percent of patients, and thus, patients who undergo endovascular repair require lifetime surveillance, which exposes the patient to the ongoing risks of repeated radiation. (See <a href=\"#H13962182\" class=\"local\">'Endovascular versus open surgical repair'</a> above and <a href=\"#H255247576\" class=\"local\">'Endograft-related complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endovascular repair of blunt thoracic injury is accomplished using a fabric-covered stent termed an endograft or stent graft. Narrow thoracic aortas (&le;17.5 mm) cannot be accommodated by any of the available thoracic endograft devices with the appropriate degree of over-sizing needed to ensure proximal fixation. Efforts are ongoing to optimize thoracic endovascular grafts for the treatment of blunt thoracic aortic injury, including provision of smaller diameter stent grafts and more flexibility to accommodate the more acutely angulated aortic arch of younger individuals.
