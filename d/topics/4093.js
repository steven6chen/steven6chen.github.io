Urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma is the predominant histologic type in the United States and Europe, where it accounts for 90 percent of all bladder cancers. In other areas of the world, non-urothelial carcinomas are more frequent. Much less commonly, urothelial cancers can arise in the renal pelvis, ureter, or urethra.

The diagnosis is often delayed due to the similarity of these symptoms to those of benign disorders (urinary tract infection, cystitis, prostatitis, passage of renal calculi), and delays can lead to a worsened prognosis due to more advanced stage at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There is evidence to suggest that delayed diagnosis accounts for the poorer survival in women diagnosed with bladder cancer compared with men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Furthermore, symptoms are often intermittent. In some patients, metastases will cause the initial symptoms. Incidental bladder cancer is rare at autopsy, suggesting that most cancers eventually become symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common presenting symptom is hematuria, which is typically intermittent, gross, painless, and present throughout micturition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The likelihood of bladder cancer increases when the hematuria is gross (visible) rather than microscopic, with some studies diagnosing bladder cancer in 10 to 20 percent of patients with gross hematuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. In those evaluated for microscopic hematuria, the reported incidence of bladder cancer ranges between 2 and 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer/abstract/4,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6-8</a>].</p><p>However, 9 to 18 percent of apparently normal individuals have some hematuria, and hematuria is due to benign causes in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer/abstract/6,7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,9</a>]. The number of red blood cells in the urine is not predictive of the probability of cancer.</p><p>The importance of evaluating hematuria was illustrated by a study of 1930 patients, in which 61 percent had no abnormality diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Abnormalities that were found included bladder cancer (12 percent), urinary tract infections (13 percent), medical renal disease (10 percent), stone disease (4 percent), kidney cancer (0.6 percent), and prostate cancer (0.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Bladder cancer was much more frequent in older patients, but seven patients with bladder cancer were younger than 40 years, including one with microscopic hematuria.</p><p>The point at which gross hematuria is noted during urination can be helpful in localizing its source:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematuria occurring primarily at the beginning of urination is usually from a urethral source.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood that is only noticed as a discharge between voidings or as a stain on undergarments, while the voided urine itself appears clear, indicates an origin at the urethral meatus or the anterior urethra.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Terminal hematuria, with blood appearing towards the end of voiding, generally originates from the bladder neck or prostatic urethra.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematuria occurring throughout voiding can originate from anywhere in the urinary tract, including the bladder, ureters, or kidneys.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain associated with bladder cancer is usually the result of locally advanced or metastatic tumors. Its distribution is related to the size and location of the primary tumor or its metastases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flank pain may result when a tumor obstructs the ureter at any level (bladder, ureter, or renal pelvis). Although obstruction usually is associated with muscle-invasive disease, large noninvasive tumors at the ureteral orifice may also cause symptoms. The pain is similar to that experienced with the passage of urinary stones, and may or may not be associated with hematuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and acute management of suspected nephrolithiasis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suprapubic pain is usually a sign of a locally advanced tumor that is either directly invading the perivesical soft tissues and nerves or obstructing the bladder outlet and causing urinary retention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypogastric, rectal, and perineal pain can be signs of disease invading the obturator fossa, perirectal fat, presacral nerves, or the urogenital diaphragm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal or right upper quadrant pain may signal the presence of abdominal lymph node or liver metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone pain may indicate the presence of bone metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant and persistent headache or disordered cognitive function may suggest the presence of intracranial or leptomeningeal metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Voiding symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Voiding symptoms are most common in patients with carcinoma in situ (CIS) of the bladder and may result from a functional decrease in the bladder capacity, detrusor overactivity, invasion of the trigone, or obstruction of the bladder neck or urethra.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irritative voiding symptoms (eg, daytime <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nocturnal frequency, urgency, dysuria, or urge incontinence) occur in approximately one-third of patients. The complex of dysuria, frequency, and urgency in particular is highly suggestive of bladder CIS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstructive voiding symptoms are less common and may be due to tumor location at the bladder neck or prostatic urethra. Symptoms include straining, an intermittent stream, nocturia, decreased force of stream, and a feeling of incomplete voiding. On occasion, gross hematuria may result in &quot;clot retention.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Constitutional symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, and failure to thrive are usually signs of advanced or metastatic disease and denote a poor prognosis. In rare cases, patients may have constitutional symptoms due to renal failure caused by bilateral ureteral obstruction.

An attempt to palpate the base and lateral walls of the bladder should be made, looking for induration or fixation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inguinal adenopathy can be present, although the inguinal region is not a common site of node metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nodularity in the periumbilical region can be seen in advanced lesions involving the dome of the bladder. This is often seen with urachal cancers, which typically are adenocarcinomas rather than urothelial tumors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal examination may reveal the presence of substantially enlarged para-aortic lymph nodes or hepatic metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of otherwise unexplained hematuria may represent urothelial cancer in individuals over the age of 40 until proven otherwise. Nevertheless, many causes are benign, such as hematuria from enlarged prostates, urinary tract infection, cystitis, prostatitis, and passage of renal calculi. The goal of the diagnostic evaluation is to determine the diagnosis, site, and extent of cancer, and the presence or absence of muscle-invasive disease.</p><p>A full urologic evaluation of the entire urinary tract is indicated in such patients unless there is clear evidence of glomerular bleeding (eg, red cell casts, proteinuria, dysmorphic red cells [particularly acanthocytes], and in patients with gross hematuria, a smoky brown color). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;, section on 'Glomerular versus nonglomerular bleeding'</a>.)</p><p>This evaluation should consist of cystourethroscopy, urinary cytology, and an evaluation of the upper tracts, since urothelial malignancy can be multifocal, with one or more lesions anywhere from the renal pelvis to the proximal urethra.</p><p>Radiographic imaging of the upper tract can consist of either a computed tomography (CT) scan of the <span class=\"nowrap\">abdomen/pelvis</span> with urography with oral and intravenous contrast or intravenous pyelography (IVP) plus nephrograms or renal ultrasound (US) to evaluate both the collecting systems and the renal cortex. IVP is rarely used and has been largely replaced by CT. Contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used in patients with allergy to iodinated contrast. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinalysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The urinalysis should include a microscopic and gross examination as well as a dipstick chemical test. Nonrefrigerated urine should be examined within 30 minutes of collection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The average individual excretes approximately 30,000 red blood cells (RBCs) per hour, which equates to approximately 1 RBC per high-power field (HPF) on microscopic examination. Hematuria is usually not considered significant unless there are more than 3 RBCs per HPF. RBC morphology may also suggest the etiology of the hematuria; cells of glomerular origin are often dysmorphic or formed in casts, indicating intrinsic renal disease, while normally-shaped RBCs are more likely from an extrinsic source such as calculi, tumor, obstruction, or infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Urine color can be affected by its concentration, ingestion of certain foods or drugs, or the presence of bacteria, and can be confused with hematuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Red to brown urine'</a>.)</p><p>Urinary pigments that can mimic hematuria include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Betalain contained in beets (beeturia)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenazopyridine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Phenazopyridine</a>, a urinary analgesic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vegetable dyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urates</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Free myoglobin or hemoglobin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serratia marcescens</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phenolphthalein, which used to be a common component of many over-the-counter laxatives</p><p/><p>On occasion, dipstick analysis will be positive for blood, but microscopic examination fails to show RBCs. This can occur when myoglobin is present in the urine, since it is chemically similar to hemoglobin. This can also occur when the RBCs are lysed and in the presence of hemoglobin occurring in the course of hemolysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease#H4221132\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Urine dipstick'</a>.)</p><p>The specific gravity of a specimen is important to note because of its influence on the stability of white blood cells or RBCs. For example, when the urinary flow rate is high and the urine is very dilute, RBCs are lysed and therefore will not be present on microscopic examination, even in the presence of pathology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Cystoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystoscopy is the gold standard for the initial diagnosis and staging of bladder cancer. This procedure is done in the office with a flexible cystoscope and only has minimal risks, such as bleeding and infection. Risk of infection is minimal using sterile techniques. In the United States, this is typically done with white light; fluorescence cystoscopy has been available in Europe and was approved for use in the United States in 2010 but not yet for office cystoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Fluorescence cystoscopy'</a> below.)</p><p>Our approach is as follows: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any visible tumor or suspicious lesion seen at the initial (diagnostic) cystoscopy should be either biopsied or resected transurethrally to determine the histology and depth of invasion into the submucosa and muscle layers of the bladder. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who presented with a positive urine cytology and whose initial cystoscopy showed no visible tumor (or suspicious lesion) within the bladder, biopsy of apparently normal appearing urothelium, prostatic urethra, and selective catheterization of the <span class=\"nowrap\">ureters/renal</span> pelvis with urine specimens for cytology from the upper tract is required. </p><p/><p>For patients with documented high-risk disease confirmed on a diagnostic transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), repeat resection may be indicated to eliminate the risk of understaging. This issue is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-initial-approach-and-management-of-urothelial-bladder-cancer#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the initial approach and management of urothelial bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Transurethral resection'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H973022634\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The procedure begins with a bimanual examination under anesthesia (EUA) to determine whether or not a palpable mass is present, and if present, whether or not it is mobile. An EUA during cystoscopy is effective for identifying locally advanced disease, which may present as gross extravesical extension, invasion of adjacent organs, or pelvic sidewall involvement. If a mass is felt, the bimanual exam is repeated after the resection to see if it is still present and to differentiate between clinical stage T2 and T3b disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110763\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110763 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> below.)</p><p>The cystoscope is then inserted into the bladder, and urine is obtained for cytology. A bladder wash specimen obtained by irrigating the bladder with sterile saline provides the highest sensitivity for detection of cancer. The bladder is inspected visually, and a detailed description of the size, number, appearance, location, and growth pattern (papillary or solid) of all lesions is recorded. This information serves as a reference for subsequent cystoscopic examinations. The status of the uninvolved mucosa is also noted.</p><p>The size, stalk, and configuration of the cancer can be predictive of muscle invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In general, low-grade, noninvasive tumors are papillary with a narrow stalk. High-grade, invasive tumors frequently can appear sessile, solid, or nodular. Carcinoma in situ (CIS) is a high-grade, noninvasive tumor, which can appear as a flat velvety lesion and can arise in patches. CIS sometimes involves large parts of the urothelial lining.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Fluorescence cystoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluorescence cystoscopy uses an intravesical photoactive protoporphyrin (such as 5-aminolevulinic acid [5-ALA] and hexyl <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminolevulinic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aminolevulinic acid</a> [HAL]), which accumulates preferentially in neoplastic rather than normal tissue. The photoactive substance enhances the visual difference between normal and neoplastic tissue after illumination with light of the appropriate wavelength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The HAL is instilled one hour prior to cystoscopy.</p><p>Randomized trials have confirmed that fluorescence cystoscopy detects more tumors (both papillary and CIS) than white-light cystoscopy, and this improved tumor identification results in a better patient management. The safety profile of fluorescence cystoscopy is excellent. The improved early detection and treatment of tumors need to be balanced by a slightly higher false-positive rate (mainly due to inflammation and scarring), the requirement for a special lens system, the need to instill the photosensitizer one hour prior to cystoscopy, and the need for rigid rather than flexible cystoscopy, as well as the higher cost. The clinical results with fluorescence endoscopy are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-non-muscle-invasive-urothelial-bladder-cancer#H1354236219\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary non-muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Fluorescence endoscopy and narrow band imaging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine cytology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytology is commonly used as an adjunct to cystoscopy to detect CIS and upper-tract malignancies. The underlying concept is that cells in the urinary tract that are proliferating rapidly will be exfoliated. However, urine cytology has a relatively poor sensitivity, particularly for low-grade tumors. This was illustrated by a meta-analysis that included 18 studies with 1255 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The overall sensitivity was 34 percent, with sensitivities for grade 1, 2, and 3 tumors of 12, 26, and 64 percent, respectively.</p><p>Lower-grade tumors have fewer morphologic alterations that may lead to the loss of intercellular attachments and adhesiveness. Thus, they may not exfoliate as easily as higher-grade tumors. When they are exfoliated, low-grade tumors are shed in large papillary fragments with uniform size, minimal alterations in nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, and small or absent nucleoli. Higher-grade tumor cells tend to be more isolated in loose clusters and elongated with marked pleomorphism, increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, and variable nucleoli size.</p><p>False-positive results are rare with urine cytology (specificity &gt;98 percent in most studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, any positive cytology should be assumed to represent malignancy. If no disease is evident in the bladder, the upper urinary tracts and prostatic urethra should be thoroughly evaluated. If no lesion is discernible, selective ureteral and renal pelvis washings may be performed; however, the diagnostic accuracy of these procedures is debated because of possible contamination from the bladder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignancies-of-the-renal-pelvis-and-ureter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignancies of the renal pelvis and ureter&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Urine cytology specimens must be properly collected and stored in order to maintain a high level of diagnostic accuracy. Catheterized specimens can denude normal surface epithelial cells; coalescence in papillary groups may be misinterpreted as low-grade transitional cell carcinoma (TCC). Voided specimens with prolonged exposure to concentrated urine or specimens from women that are contaminated with vaginal, cervical, or endometrial cells can also be misinterpreted. Cytology specimens should be processed promptly, as cells will degrade after 10 to 15 minutes at room temperature. One study showed a lower diagnostic yield with voided urine specimens when compared with bladder washings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Chronic urinary tract infections, inflammatory conditions, stone disease, recent instrumentation or intravesical therapy, and bowel substitutions for the bladder (eg, ileal conduits or orthotopic neobladders) can create degenerative cellular changes and atypia, which can be misinterpreted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-diversion-and-reconstruction-following-cystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary diversion and reconstruction following cystectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Urine-based markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple urine-based tumor markers have been developed because of the low sensitivity of cytology and the need for a noninvasive diagnostic tool to supplement cystoscopy. These urine biomarkers are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urine-biomarkers-for-the-detection-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urine biomarkers for the detection of urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma of the bladder&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Urine-based tumor markers have been developed that are based on differential expression of tumor-related proteins, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), or cellular markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The pooled sensitivity of urine-based tumor markers ranges from 50 to 80 percent, and specificity ranges from 70 to 90 percent, depending upon the analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The sensitivity of markers and cytology correlates closely with stage and grade.</p><p>Most urine-based molecular markers are more sensitive than urine cytology in the detection of urothelial cancer, especially for low-grade tumors, but the specificity of molecular markers is inferior to that of urine cytology. </p><p>None of these markers have sufficient sensitivity to replace cystoscopy in the assessment of an individual suspected to have bladder cancer, and their clinical use has not been recommended by consensus panels. There is potential benefit for surveillance in patients with a history of urothelial cancer by reducing the frequency of cystoscopy. There is evidence that markers, such as UroVysion fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assay, may help management of patients with atypical findings on cytology or cystoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

CT scans should include both the abdomen and pelvis, and should include delayed images to identify defects in the collecting system. CT may demonstrate extravesical extension, nodal involvement in the pelvis or retroperitoneum, visceral, pulmonary, or osseous metastasis, and tumor involvement or obstruction of the upper urinary tract.</p><p>Although CT provides better visualization of tumors than US, it may miss tumors &lt;1 cm in size, particularly those in the bladder trigone or dome, and it cannot differentiate depth of bladder-wall invasion (ie, mucosal versus lamina propria or muscularis propria).</p><p>Although a thickened bladder wall on CT suggests the presence of muscle-invasive disease, tissue is required for diagnosis. In contrast, CT is approximately 80 percent accurate in differentiating locally advanced tumors involving extravesical adipose tissue or surrounding structures from less invasive tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F52521\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52521 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. An important caveat is that in most instances, CT is performed after a transurethral resection, which complicates its interpretation. It may be difficult to distinguish inflammatory or iatrogenic edematous changes from true extravesical tumor extension.</p><p>The sensitivity of CT for identification of nodal involvement is relatively low (false-negative rate 68 percent, false-positive rate 16 percent) and requires a needle or excisional biopsy for confirmation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Intravenous pyelogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An IVP can visualize both the bladder and upper urinary tracts.

IVP is more sensitive for detection of small lesions of the ureter or renal pelvis, while CT scan and renal US are better tests for the evaluation of renal parenchymal disease. Ideally, if IVP is obtained, it should be done prior to TURBT to avoid misinterpretation of postoperative changes.

IVP may also not be appropriate in patients with a history of allergies to radiocontrast agents, although prophylactic corticosteroids and antihistamines may be useful. In patients in whom the ureters and renal pelvis are poorly visualized by IVP, retrograde pyelograms may be performed during cystoscopy.

Both the cystogram phase and the post-void film should be examined for filling defects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F68718\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68718 \">image 2</a>), which are usually irregular, frond-like, or nodular, and persistent from film to film. Filling defects may be the result of parietal tumor implantation, the uneven jagged contours of papillary fronds, or obstruction of a ureter with proximal dilation. The classic urographic findings of an upper tract TCC are a meniscus-shaped ureteral filling defect known as the &quot;goblet&quot; or &quot;Bergmann&quot; sign and the &quot;stipple sign,&quot; produced by contrast being trapped in the fronds of a papillary tumor.</p><p>Approximately 50 percent of patients with a filling defect in the renal pelvis or ureter will have associated hydronephrosis, hydroureter, or nonvisualization of the kidney secondary to obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Invasive bladder tumors may cause distal ureteral obstruction and secondary hydronephrosis. Although the lack of this finding does not rule out invasive disease, its presence signals an invasive cancer in over 90 percent of cases and extravesical disease in 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] for unilateral and 90 percent for bilateral hydronephrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Nonvisualization of the kidney is usually seen in advanced disease and is frequently associated with invasion of tumor into the renal parenchyma. Stenosis is also a specific sign of infiltrating disease and is more commonly seen in the ureter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F75824\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75824 \">image 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI is as reliable as CT for staging of invasive or locally advanced disease and may be better at evaluating tumors at the base and dome of the bladder.

The guidelines recommend imaging of the chest for all patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer, but they do not specify the type of scan, so both chest radiographs and CT scan are acceptable. Bone scan and imaging of the brain are reserved for symptomatic patients. Positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> is typically only used in patients with suspicious lymph nodes, but it is not commonly used.</p><p>Because bladder tumors often occur in older adults, a general medical evaluation is also essential to document significant comorbid conditions, which might interfere with appropriate treatment regimens (ie, ability to tolerate general anesthesia, prolonged surgery, chemotherapy).

Urothelial tumors may grow into the prostate along the prostatic ducts; these are noninvasive lesions with a good prognosis when resected.
