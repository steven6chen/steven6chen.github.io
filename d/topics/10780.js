When the vessels get too narrow, the heart muscle does not get enough blood. This causes chest pain, especially during physical activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1831641436\"><span class=\"h1\">What do medicines for angina do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medicines for angina help prevent or ease chest pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53164\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53164 \">figure 1</a>). They can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relax blood vessels going to the heart muscle &ndash; This lets more blood flow to the heart</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce the amount of work the heart muscle has to do</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1831641451\"><span class=\"h1\">What medicines might I need?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will decide which medicine is best for you. Some people take just one medicine for angina. But the first medicine you try might not help enough. If that happens, tell your doctor or nurse. People sometimes need to try a few different medicines before they find the treatment that works for them. And some people take 2 or 3 of the medicines together.</p><p>There are 4 types of medicines that doctors use to treat angina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F85928\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85928 \">table 1</a>). These are listed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1831641468\"><span class=\"h1\">Nitrates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These medicines come in many different forms, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pills or powder that go under your tongue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sprays that go on or under your tongue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pills that you swallow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patches you wear on your skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ointment that you put on your skin</p><p/><p>Your doctor will decide which form of nitrate is best for you. It depends on how often you get angina, how long it usually lasts, and what kinds of situations cause you to get it. Sit down if you are taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">nitroglycerin</a> to relieve chest pain. Sometimes, doctors tell people to take under-the-tongue nitrates before they exercise. This can prevent angina. Keep nitroglycerin tablets in the bottle they came in with the cap on tightly.</p><p>If you take nitrates, there are certain things you should know:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Call for an ambulance if your chest pain lasts</strong> &ndash; Your doctor might tell you to take 2 to 3 doses of under-the-tongue or spray <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">nitroglycerin</a> spaced 5 minutes apart when you get angina. But if your chest pain lasts more than 5 minutes after you take your last dose, <strong>call for an ambulance right away (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>. You might be having a heart attack.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Beware of the side effects</strong> &ndash; The side effects of nitrates include a fast heart rate, a headache, feeling lightheaded, fainting, and &quot;flushing.&quot; Flushing is when your skin gets red and feels hot, especially on your face. You should sit down when you take under-the-tongue or spray <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">nitroglycerin</a> to lower your risk of fainting. Older people are more likely to get lightheaded than younger people, especially in hot weather. Drinking alcohol can make nitrate side effects worse, so be very careful when taking these medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoid erection medicines</strong> &ndash; If you are a man and take nitrates, do <strong>not</strong> take medicines to help you get or keep an erection. These medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">sildenafil</a> (brand name: Viagra), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vardenafil-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vardenafil</a> (brand name: Levitra), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tadalafil-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">tadalafil</a> (brand name: Cialis). Taking these medicines with nitrates is very dangerous.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1831641483\"><span class=\"h1\">Beta blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These medicines are usually taken 1 or 2 times a day to prevent angina. There are many different types of beta blockers. Your doctor will choose the best one for you based on your age and any other health problems you might have.</p><p>When you first start taking beta-blockers, they might make you feel tired. That is just while the body gets used to the medicine. You might have other side effects, such as breathing problems or &ndash; if you are a man &ndash; trouble getting an erection. You might need to try many different beta blockers to find the one that causes the fewest side effects and works best for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1831641515\"><span class=\"h1\">Calcium channel blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors usually only give these medicines to people who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can't take beta blockers because of side effects or because of other health problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Still have angina even though they take nitrates and beta blockers</p><p/><p>Side effects from calcium channel blockers include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flushing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness and lightheadedness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling of the feet and ankles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constipation</p><p/><p>The side effects will depend on the kind of calcium channel blocker you take. You might need to try many different kinds to find the one that causes the fewest side effects and works best for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1831641530\"><span class=\"h1\">Ranolazine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This is the latest medicine (brand name: Ranexa) for treating angina. Doctors give this to people who still have angina even while taking a combination of beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or nitrates. The side effects include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling dizzy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upset stomach</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constipation</p><p/><p>For more detailed information about your medicines, ask your doctor or nurse for the patient hand-out from Lexicomp available through UpToDate. It explains how to use each medicine, describes its possible side effects, and lists other medicines or foods that can affect how it works.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1831641547\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chest pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-after-a-heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines after a heart attack (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medications-for-angina-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Medications for angina (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=angina-treatment-medical-versus-interventional-therapy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Angina treatment &mdash; medical versus interventional therapy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
