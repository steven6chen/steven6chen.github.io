In a series of 2282 women with invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), the incidence of ALN involvement was as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tis &ndash; 0.8 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T1a &ndash; 5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T1b &ndash; 16 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T1c &ndash; 28 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T2 &ndash; 47 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T3 &ndash; 68 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T4 &ndash; 86 percent</p><p/><p>Similar findings were reported in a contemporary series of 6800 women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer after screening mammography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F52857\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52857 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

This is likely attributable to an underestimate of tumor burden. Tumor size is generally recorded as the largest dimension on the first excision.

This is generally accepted to be due to the presence of a small, undetected invasive component rather than the ability of pure DCIS to metastasize to the axilla. Thus, axillary dissection is not routinely performed in women who have pure DCIS.

The most likely explanation for this difference is preferential drainage of some medial tumors to the internal mammary (IM) nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Internal mammary lymph nodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like the ALNs, the IM nodes receive lymph drainage from all quadrants of the breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, medial tumors have a significantly higher rate of IM nodal metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Although the IM nodal chain extends from the fifth intercostal space to the retroclavicular region, nodes in the upper three interspaces are most likely to contain metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p>Isolated IM nodal metastases are infrequent; more often axillary nodes are involved as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/18,20,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20,24</a>]. In a report of over 7000 cases in which the IM and ALNs were examined, IM metastases were detected in 22 percent, but were the only site of metastases in 4.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

PET scans and integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> may reveal IM nodal disease that is unrecognized by conventional staging methods, but neither of these modalities can provide pathologic confirmation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The use of PET-CT in staging breast cancer patients is discussed elsewhere.

Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping often identifies nonaxillary nodes, although the ability to identify these nodes does not imply a clinical benefit for biopsy or removal. Following four early randomized trials showing no survival benefit from extended mastectomy (which included IM nodal dissection) as compared with radical or modified radical mastectomy (even in the absence of chemotherapy), routine dissection of IM nodes was abandoned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. Furthermore, the widespread use of adjuvant systemic therapy for women with both node-positive and node negative breast cancer has diminished the importance of the IM nodes in clinical care. </p><p>However, results from randomized trials testing the value of postmastectomy radiation therapy and a meta-analysis by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) provide high level evidence that local-regional tumor control is associated with long-term survival benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. These benefits have been limited to trials that used systemic therapy, which may explain why earlier randomized trials (in which adjuvant systemic therapy was not routinely administered) failed to show a survival benefit from resection of the IM nodes.

The positive predictive value of clinical palpation (ie, likelihood of finding axillary metastases in a patient with suspicious findings on physical examination) ranges from 61 to 84 percent, while the negative predictive value (ie, the likelihood that axillary nodal metastases are absent in a patient with no suspicious findings on physical examination) is only 50 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. Thus, surgical staging is indicated, even in the setting of a clinically negative axilla, if it will change clinical management. Selected older women with small (&le;2 cm) ER-positive tumors who will receive adjuvant endocrine therapy and who are clinically node negative may be managed without axillary surgery.

However, SLND is now accepted as the initial approach for women with early stage breast cancer. Accordingly, the use of full ALND for staging purposes in clinically node negative patients is contraindicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>The potential benefits of ALND for patients with clinically positive axillary lymph nodes include its impact on disease control (ie, axillary recurrence), its prognostic value, and its role in treatment selection. Histologic examination of removed LNs at the time of ALND is thought to be the most accurate method for assessing spread of disease to these nodes. The anatomic disruption caused by ALND may result in lymphedema, nerve injury, and shoulder dysfunction, which compromise functionality and quality of life. Thus, the role of ALND in breast cancer management has been questioned, particularly in older women who are receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>.

The clinical approach to such patients is best resolved on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all of the other risk factors and co-morbidities for each patient to determine whether or not to complete the ALND. Patient autonomy should be incorporated in the decision making process. The management of a positive SLN biopsy is controversial and is discussed in detail elsewhere.

The extent of dissection is a tradeoff between the greater morbidity of a more extensive ALND and the possibility of leaving residual untreated axillary disease. In general, a level I and II anatomic ALND is the preferred procedure for axillary assessment. The technique of axillary dissection is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technique-of-axillary-lymph-node-dissection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Technique of axillary lymph node dissection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Axillary sampling (removal of four to six nodes) is an imprecisely defined procedure in which variable amounts of the axillary contents are removed, often without reference to anatomic structures. It has been performed, mainly for staging purposes, in an attempt to reduce the morbidity of ALND [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. One study found that 24 percent of women undergoing axillary sampling were erroneously staged as determined by subsequent complete ALND [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. This is significantly higher than the false negative rate with sentinel node biopsy (approximately 5 to 10 percent). Thus, axillary sampling does not represent the standard of care. Sentinel node biopsy represents a strategy for directed sampling that increases the probability of identifying positive nodes over undirected sampling techniques, thus allowing fewer nodes to be removed without increasing the axillary failure rate.

The axillary failure rates increase when fewer than five LNs are removed (5 to 21 percent) as compared with when more than five LNs are removed (3 to 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Impact of ALND on survival</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of the number of resected axillary lymph nodes on survival is unclear. Retrospective reports suggest inferior survival with fewer (often &lt;10) resected ALNs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/49-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-55</a>] while others suggest no prognostic impact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/44,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,56,57</a>]. The available data regarding the presence of a survival advantage for lymphadenectomy over observation alone are conflicting. Some studies have raised the possibility that failure to remove tumor-bearing ALNs could be detrimental in patients with breast cancer:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study of 658 women with a clinically negative axilla, patients were randomly assigned to partial mastectomy alone or partial mastectomy plus ALND [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. RT was given to both groups, and women who had histologically positive LNs found on ALND received chemotherapy. ALND was associated with significantly better five-year survival (97 versus 93 percent), and a reduced frequency of visceral and supraclavicular metastases, and lymph node recurrences. There was a lower incidence of axillary and supraclavicular failures in patients who underwent ALND, although the only patients to receive chemotherapy were in the ALND group, making this a confounding variable because chemotherapy improves survival. However, with longer follow-up, survival rates were similar (approximately 75 percent) in both groups at 10 and 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A survival benefit for ALND was suggested in a retrospective population-based cohort of 8038 patients treated for T1-2 breast cancer in British Columbia between 1989 and 1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. ALND had been omitted from the treatment of 4, 8, and 22 percent of women 50 to 64, 65 to 74, and &gt;74 years old, respectively. Despite the fact that all of the clinical factors associated with the omission of ALND were favorable (ie, smaller tumor size, lower histologic grade, absence of lymphovascular invasion), overall and cancer-specific five-year survival rates were significantly worse in those who had not undergone ALND (68 versus 85 percent, and 86 versus 91 percent, respectively). Systemic therapy use and regional relapse rates were comparable between the women who underwent axillary dissection and those who did not in each age-specific cohort. However, locoregional recurrence rates were not significantly higher if ALND was not performed. These data suggest that positive axillary nodes represent an indicator of the propensity for metastatic behavior rather than a nidus for later disease dissemination, which, if removed, would improve outcomes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A similar relationship between ALND and survival was reported in a retrospective review of 257,157 women diagnosed with breast cancer in the SEER database between 1988 and 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Survival was significantly better among women who underwent lymphadenectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F78108\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78108 \">table 2</a>), even when controlling for race, use of RT, type of surgery, hormone receptor status, age, and stage. There was a consistent trend toward decreased survival as the ratio of positive to total number of nodes removed increased. The results were similar if SLN cases (which accounted for only 5.6 percent of the population) were included or excluded from the analysis. However, survival differences could be due to the use of lymph node status to influence systemic therapy decisions. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of six trials that included over 3000 women who were randomly assigned to ALND or no ALND demonstrated an average improvement in absolute survival of 4.5 percent at 10 years with ALND, (range 4 to 16 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. However, this analysis was limited by several deficiencies: the trials were conducted over a span of four decades (1951 to 1987), few patients had T1a tumors, none used modern systemic adjuvant chemotherapy, and none enrolled women over the age of 70.</p><p/><p>The most frequently quoted data arguing against the need for routine ALND in early stage breast cancer are from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project trial B-04 (NSABP B-04) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Women with clinically node negative invasive breast cancer were randomly assigned to radical mastectomy (which by definition includes ALND), simple mastectomy plus local nodal irradiation, or simple mastectomy with ALND delayed until positive LNs developed. The inability to detect significant differences among the three groups with respect to disease-free or overall survival (approximately 57 percent) at 10 years (and in a later report, with 25-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]) argues against a therapeutic role for ALND.</p><p>A subsequent meta-analysis of three randomized trials comparing axillary dissection versus no dissection published between 2000 and 2007 as well as a 4th trial comparing axillary radiotherapy versus no axillary therapy found no difference in overall survival, metastases, or ipsilateral breast recurrence associated with axillary treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. This may be attributable to the widespread use of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy during this time frame, especially since breast radiation for breast conservation includes at least the low axillary field.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Major complications of ALND are infrequent, but include injury or thrombosis of the axillary vein and injury to the motor nerves.

At least three randomized trials have addressed this issue, all of which suggest that selected older women who have small (&lt;2 cm) estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors, who have a clinically uninvolved axilla and who are receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy may be treated without immediate axillary surgery without an adverse effect on outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>].

Although the 10-year survival was similar in the three groups, the axillary failure rate was significantly higher in the women treated without primary ALND (18 percent) compared with those undergoing RT or initial ALND (3.1 and 1.4 percent respectively). The rate of axillary failure was probably higher than 18 percent in those undergoing delayed ALND, because inoperable axillary recurrences and operable axillary recurrences that occurred simultaneously with or after distant metastases were excluded. It should be noted, however, that the time period for this study was 1971 to 1974, when the use of mammographic screening was neither widespread nor as sophisticated as it is presently. The mean tumor size in this study was generally larger than we identify today. Since the likelihood of subclinical axillary metastases increases with increasing tumor size, we would anticipate that axillary failure rates without dissection or radiation today would be significantly lower than 18 percent, especially in light of our current adjuvant chemotherapy regimens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of women who were randomly assigned to partial mastectomy and RT with or without ALND, patients with histologically positive ALNs also received RT to the supraclavicular and IM nodes plus chemotherapy, while those with medial or central lesions received IM nodal irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. At a mean follow-up of 54 months, the RT alone group had a higher rate of axillary failure (2.1 versus 0.9 percent), and a significantly lower rate of survival (93 versus 97 percent). However, in a later report with median 180 month follow-up, both the 10 and 15 year survival rates were similar (73.8 versus 75.5 percent at 15 years, respectively), despite the threefold higher axillary recurrence rate with RT alone (3 versus 1 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-regional-lymph-nodes-in-breast-cancer/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial of 381 women undergoing BCT for tumors &lt;1 cm in diameter, those who had a clinically negative axilla were randomly assigned to ALND or axillary RT.

Thus, whether ALND is therapeutic for a subset of patients is still debatable. Only those women with ALN involvement have the potential to benefit from ALND, because removal of normal nodes should not alter survival. For this reason, identification of patients who have involved ALNs by a less morbid procedure such as SLN biopsy or axillary ultrasound with fine needle aspirate or core biopsy is recommended.
