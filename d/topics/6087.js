A significant proportion of patients with external bleeding can exsanguinate prior to definitive hemostasis due to the inability to apply direct pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Internal hemorrhage requires rapid surgical intervention. Aortic occlusion as a part of trauma management can decrease the amount of bleeding and provide a window of opportunity for resuscitation and definitive hemorrhage control. Options for aortic occlusion include direct clamping through an open incisional technique (emergent thoracotomy) and resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion (REBOA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H669602\"><span class=\"h1\">TORSO HEMORRHAGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noncompressible torso hemorrhage remains the leading cause of preventable death following military injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and, from registry studies, significantly contributes to mortality in civilian traumatic injury as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Torso hemorrhage may originate from arterial, venous, or combined sources within the chest, abdomen, or pelvis. Junctional hemorrhage from noncompressible sites in the axilla or groin is also included in this definition. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1199278444\"><span class=\"h1\">RESUSCITATIVE AORTIC OCCLUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of hemorrhage generally consists of direct pressure to limit external bleeding with resuscitation and, subsequently, definitive repair to stop bleeding. However, the inability to directly compress vessels in the torso leads to a significant proportion of patients exsanguinating prior to definitive management, often in the prehospital setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. This risk is higher in rural or resource-limited environments where transport time to definitive surgical care may be prolonged. Management of torso hemorrhage as a result of trauma has traditionally included direct aortic clamping via a thoracotomy for patients in extremis or abdominal incision for those in the operating room. Several alternative management approaches to this vexing clinical problem have also been explored. Military antishock trousers (MAST) gained popularity many years ago as a noninvasive approach to prehospital torso hemorrhage control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, further evaluation of this approach demonstrated no clear benefit, and they have since fallen out of use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A novel approach to torso hemorrhage that is undergoing preclinical testing is use of intraperitoneal expanding foams that create a tamponade effect to slow or stop bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. This approach is not yet approved for use in the United States. Several compression devices for junctional hemorrhage are also in development. This review focuses exclusively on the emerging use of endovascular aortic occlusion, known as resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA).</p><p>With developing expertise in minimally invasive endovascular methods, REBOA has been advocated as another approach supporting perfusion of vital organs until definitive hemostasis can be achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/10,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15</a>]. REBOA has the advantage of being less invasive than open thoracotomy and, in one small observational study, was associated with fewer early deaths and improved overall survival compared with resuscitative thoracotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Consequently, preemptive placement in the emergency department (ED) or in the operating room (OR) prior to full cardiovascular collapse is possible. REBOA may also facilitate further imaging and access to angiography for embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H351710139\" class=\"local\">'Timing of placement'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351701134\"><span class=\"h2\">Evolution of endovascular aortic control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The earliest reported use of aortic balloon occlusion in trauma was during the Korean War, where a balloon catheter was inserted via the femoral artery into the thoracic aorta in two patients with abdominal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Although neither patient survived deflation of the balloon, the maneuver effectively demonstrated the feasibility of balloon occlusion to aid resuscitation. Open aortic clamping in the operating room subsequently gained favor as a means to resuscitate patients in extremis. Some surgeons even advocated thoracotomy and aortic clamping for patients with extrathoracic trauma who presented with tense hemoperitoneum and preserved pulses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In subsequent years, resuscitative thoracotomy with aortic clamping, now typically performed in the emergency department, has gained acceptance for the management of patients with traumatic arrest from torso injuries within a limited time window [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and for some nontorso injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=resuscitative-thoracotomy-technique#H536270528\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Resuscitative thoracotomy: Technique&quot;, section on 'Morbidity and mortality'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Balloon occlusion for traumatic arrest was again attempted years later, but results were similar to the initial experience during the Korean War due, in part, to equipment limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. These technical hurdles have largely been overcome with the maturation and proliferation of endovascular techniques, and balloon occlusion techniques have matured. Although civilian trauma surgeons have been slow to adopt these techniques given the prior trauma experience, balloon occlusion techniques have been used successfully to manage bleeding associated with nontraumatic pathologies such as pelvic bleeding from postpartum hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>], bleeding following elective orthopedic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>], and control of hemorrhage from ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/30-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-symptomatic-non-ruptured-and-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H108751839\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of symptomatic (non-ruptured) and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Aneurysm repair'</a>.)</p><p>The military experience of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan affirmed the need for improved methods of hemorrhage control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. One analysis of battlefield mortality demonstrated that one in four combat deaths were potentially preventable, with the overwhelming majority (91 percent) due to hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. A sustained effort was made thereafter to characterize the physiology of aortic occlusion and refine balloon occlusion techniques specifically for use during resuscitation for trauma. (See <a href=\"#H351707269\" class=\"local\">'Physiology'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1199278456\" class=\"local\">'REBOA technique'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351707269\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with hypovolemia, aortic occlusion (open or endovascular) can restore blood pressure to within normal physiological values (at least temporarily) by increasing cardiac afterload, thereby increasing cerebral and myocardial perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. In a systematic review, a pooled analysis of six studies demonstrated an average rise in systolic blood pressure of 53 mmHg following balloon inflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Although both approaches effectively lower the volume of distribution of the remaining circulating blood volume, a minimally invasive approach may afford some benefit. In one animal study directly comparing REBOA with open, transthoracic aortic occlusion, the REBOA group required less resuscitation and vasopressor support and had significantly lower lactate levels than the open aortic occlusion group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>Large animal models of controlled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/40,41,43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41,43-45</a>] or uncontrolled hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>] have further characterized the survival and metabolic implications of REBOA. Specifically, REBOA appears to be life-saving as compared with no occlusion in a model of severe liver injury with intraperitoneal hemorrhage (six of eight REBOA animals survived to the end of the five-hour observation period as compared with no survivors in the control group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Furthermore, progressively longer periods of balloon occlusion (up to 90 minutes) increase lactate levels, IL-6 levels, vasopressor use, and acute respiratory distress syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. </p><p>Importantly, although torso hemorrhage can originate from sites in the chest or from venous sources for which aortic control will have a more limited effect at reducing bleeding, REBOA may still have a role in these or any other clinical setting where a delay to definitive hemorrhage control is likely. Although expeditious operative hemorrhage control should be a priority, REBOA can provide a window of opportunity (even though there may be some ongoing bleeding) by reducing the volume of distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/47,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351701259\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIAL INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Precise indications for resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion (REBOA) in trauma remain poorly defined. Identifying patients who will truly benefit has and will continue to prove difficult, as benefits for balloon occlusion have been difficult to demonstrate even for a well-defined single entity such as ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). (See <a href=\"#H351707551\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical and endovascular repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One review suggests that REBOA should be considered in patients with abdominal or pelvic hemorrhage who have a detectable pulse but whose systolic blood pressure remains 80 mmHg or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In such patients, REBOA can be placed as a bedside procedure without moving the patient. The level at which the balloon is placed depends on the indication. Once the balloon is inflated, further measures can be taken to identify and control the source of hemorrhage either surgically or by endovascular means.<strong> </strong>(See <a href=\"#H351707980\" class=\"local\">'Zones'</a> below.)</p><p>REBOA can be considered in those with traumatic cardiac arrest provided thoracic sources of hemorrhage or tension physiology have been excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H669927\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal trauma with shock</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients presenting in hemorrhagic shock with clinical signs of traumatic hemoperitoneum require expeditious hemorrhage control, which generally consists of damage control resuscitation and damage control laparotomy. However, for some patients, any reduction in cardiac afterload (such as with anesthesia induction agents causing vasodilation) can lead to circulatory arrest. Under this circumstance, a Zone I REBOA (see <a href=\"#H351707980\" class=\"local\">'Zones'</a> below) may offer a &quot;physiological bridge.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of splenic injury in the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Splenic embolization'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hepatic-trauma-in-adults#H631342355\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hepatic trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Hepatic embolization'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H669933\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvic trauma with shock</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with pelvic trauma, Zone III REBOA can be used, provided the patient has no evidence of intra-abdominal bleeding. A lower level of aortic occlusion has the advantage of maintaining visceral and renal perfusion, thereby reducing the degree of <span class=\"nowrap\">ischemia/reperfusion</span> injury upon balloon deflation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Specific algorithms for managing hemodynamically unstable patients with pelvic fractures have been well described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/52-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-56</a>]. In such patients, REBOA is well suited as a complimentary intervention to sustain proximal perfusion in patients who are transient responders or nonresponders to resuscitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-pelvic-fracture-in-the-adult-trauma-patient#H1329894754\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe pelvic fracture in the adult trauma patient&quot;, section on 'Arteriography and angioembolization'</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H669939\"><span class=\"h2\">Torso trauma at risk of hemorrhagic shock</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obtaining safe arterial access is extremely challenging once the patient has arrested. An alternative to waiting for traumatic arrest or profound shock to ensue is proactive aortic control, in which femoral access is obtained preemptively in patients considered at high risk of torso bleeding. In this manner, the femoral site can be used for blood pressure monitoring and serial blood gas chemistry analysis to aid with resuscitation and used for placement of a balloon catheter in more controlled circumstances should the need arise. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21248918\"><span class=\"h2\">Others</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Balloon aortic occlusion for hemorrhage from compressible sites in the extremities has not been studied to date, although tourniquets for extremity hemorrhage have proven to be very effective. REBOA deployment prehospital or prior to transport to a referral trauma center has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/57-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-60</a>]. However, such &quot;extended&quot; indications for REBOA should be carefully evaluated in the setting of a research protocol by centers facile with this technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H670359\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are not candidates for resuscitative thoracotomy should not be considered for REBOA at this time. Furthermore, patients with penetrating thoracic trauma or evidence of thoracic hemorrhage should not undergo REBOA. A relative contraindication to REBOA is inability to obtain femoral vascular access, which may be an issue for those patients who have undergone prior femoral vascular procedures or who have stigmata of significant peripheral vascular disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351707913\"><span class=\"h1\">AORTIC ANATOMY AND ZONES OF DEPLOYMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351707980\"><span class=\"h2\">Zones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To facilitate appropriate balloon placement, the aorta has been characterized into three functional zones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F101783\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101783 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Zone I extends from the left subclavian artery to the celiac trunk, and occlusion in this region will control inflow to the abdominal viscera as well as to the pelvis and lower extremities. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Zone II lies between the celiac trunk and the lowest renal artery and has traditionally been considered a zone of no occlusion, although the consequences of Zone II occlusion have not been specifically assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Zone III is comprised of the infrarenal aorta, and occlusion in this region controls pelvic and lower extremity inflow.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351709835\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given that most patients undergoing resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion (REBOA) will undergo definitive surgery to control hemorrhage, prophylactic antibiotics should be administered, but, given the life-threatening situation, REBOA placement should not be delayed waiting for antibiotic infusion.

Common examples include the Coda Balloon and the Q50. As a result, most endovascular balloons require a large-caliber sheath (12 Fr or greater) to support placement of the large balloon (up to 50 mm in diameter) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Trauma patients have a morphologically normal aorta, with maximum diameters reported in the 25- to 30-mm range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Current systems use a conventional over-the-wire method of deployment, which is an effective delivery method but necessitates the use of a long wire, which can be cumbersome in an emergency setting, especially outside the operating room. Novel devices that are not uniformly available (eg, ER-REBOA catheter), are low profile (7 Fr), and do not require a wire have been developed specifically for emergency occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. These devices have yet to undergo rigorous clinical evaluation. </p><p>Real-time imaging, typically using fluoroscopy, is preferred with available balloon catheter systems to ensure that wires and catheters are not advanced too proximally or into aortic side branches, which could lead to complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Blind placement of aortic occlusion balloons by inexperienced operators in patients without a definite need clearly can lead to significant complications. Imaging is also required to ensure that the balloon is positioned appropriately within the desired aortic zone. Several studies have demonstrated a linear relationship between torso height and aortic length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/61,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,63</a>].

Trauma surgeons should be taught and can learn to gain arterial access and safely place aortic occlusion balloons, particularly in high-volume trauma centers. However, moving beyond the control stage to any form of endovascular treatment should include the assistance of a vascular surgeon.

Thus, in patients with appropriate potential indications, prompt REBOA placement has the potential to save lives while delayed insertion or misplacement can introduce significant delays to the management of critical patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].

Prior to initiating REBOA, the appropriate sterile equipment must be assembled (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F88039\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88039 \">table 1</a>).

The common femoral artery (CFA) is used most commonly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51298\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51298 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Transbrachial access has been described in one trauma case but may more often be applied to ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/31,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,67</a>]. First, a sterile field must be created sufficient to permit operative access to the CFA and its branches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F101783\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101783 \">figure 1</a>), if it becomes necessary. One of three methods of arterial access can be used: percutaneous access with a needle (eg, 5-Fr micropuncture) and wire using a &quot;Seldinger&quot; technique, surgical cut-down, or a wire exchange through an existing arterial line. Ultrasound guidance for femoral access can be useful, if available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arterial-catheterization-techniques-for-invasive-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arterial catheterization techniques for invasive monitoring&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once a wire has been passed retrograde from the common femoral artery into the external iliac artery, a 30- to 45-cm sheath can be passed over the wire to serve as the access platform. It is important to use a sheath size that will accommodate the balloon catheter planned for use and also to advance any wires or sheaths with caution, stopping if resistance is encountered. Once a sheath has been inserted successfully and secured into place, the wire and tapered introducer can be removed. It is good practice at this stage to withdraw blood from the sheath and flush it with 0.9% saline with heparin (10 Units <span class=\"nowrap\">heparin/mL</span> saline). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1199278468\"><span class=\"h2\">Insert the balloon catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A long &quot;working&quot; wire (eg, Rosen, intermediate stiffness) can then be inserted through the sheath and advanced into the aorta. A two-step wire exchange is preferred by some to place a stiffer wire (eg, start with a J wire and upgrade to an Amplatz). Ideally, the wire should be inserted under fluoroscopic guidance to ensure that it remains within the thoracic aorta and has not deviated into a visceral branch or the aortic arch, but serial digital radiographs can also be used. </p><p>Although experience is limited for this indication, another option is to use transabdominal ultrasound (if available) to identify and position the wire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/68-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-71</a>]. A subxiphoid view, such as that obtained during focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST), is thought to be optimal, since the imaging window through the left lobe of the liver includes a view of the thoracic aorta. This technique enables confirmation of central aortic wire position; however, the technique has only been described during elective endovascular procedures and has not been validated in the emergency department setting. If none of these is available, the experienced interventionalist can use external landmarks and catheter markings. In a systematic review, &quot;fluoroscopy-free&quot; (landmark only, landmark plus ultrasound or radiographic confirmation) deployment was reported to have a low rate of serious complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Computed tomographic measurements have also been used to determine safe insertion depths for both Zone I and Zone III placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/63,72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,72,73</a>]. A cadaver-based study concluded that the use of midsternum external landmark technique had a nearly 100 percent likelihood of successful Zone I deployment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Whether computed tomography (CT)-based measurements are more reliable for balloon placement compared with external landmark or ultrasound-based landmarks requires prospective evaluation.</p><p>The balloon catheter (eg, CODA) can then be mounted on the wire and advanced into position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F101784\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101784 \">picture 1</a>). Care must be taken to ensure contact with the wire outside the patient at all times and to stop advancing the catheter if resistance is encountered. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1199278474\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflate the balloon catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 30-mL Luer lock syringe should be filled with a 50:50 mix of 0.9% saline and iodine-based contrast solution. This should be attached to the balloon port, and the balloon should then be inflated, ideally under fluoroscopic control (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F101785\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef101785 \">image 1</a>). It is important to maintain the long sheath in place just below the balloon to provide support and prevent the balloon from being pushed inferiorly as it inflates. As the balloon adopts the contour of the aorta and resistance is felt in the syringe, inflation is complete. The wire should be left in the balloon catheter to stiffen the catheter shaft and avoid balloon migration. </p><p>A clinical method of confirming aortic, rather than iliac, artery placement is to palpate for the contralateral femoral pulse, which should be absent. Additionally, an absent left brachial pulse should alert the operator to a distal arch placement, proximal to the left subclavian artery. Once content with the position of the balloon catheter, the apparatus must be secured to the patient's leg. This must be in such a way that will maintain integrity of the sterile field and permit readjustment of the balloon catheter if required.</p><p>An ultrasound technique for balloon positioning has also been described for infrarenal occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Insufflation of the balloon with a solution containing a microbubble contrast agent enhances ultrasound observability. Again, human data in an emergency setting are lacking, and such techniques should be considered experimental. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351707872\"><span class=\"h2\">Identify and control bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the balloon is placed outside the operating room, the wire and the balloon should be secured upon balloon inflation as a unit to the patient's leg for transport. The inflating syringe should remain attached to the balloon port with the stopcock in the off position. This syringe must be carefully monitored during transport. The next step in management should be determined by the attending trauma surgeon. In all cases, damage control resuscitation should continue. Typically, patients will be taken for emergent operative or endovascular control of hemorrhage if they are not already in the operating room. Although obtaining a CT of the head <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> torso with the balloon in place has been described, this risks prolonged ischemic time and delays definitive hemorrhage control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of damage control surgery and resuscitation in patients sustaining severe injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1199278480\"><span class=\"h2\">Deflate the balloon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This step must be undertaken following communication with the anesthesia team. Ideally, definitive hemostasis will have been achieved, along with sufficient resuscitation to generate normal hemodynamic indices. This is to ensure that significant bleeding does not occur and that the patient is suitably resilient to the reperfusion injury following balloon deflation. </p><p>On occasion, it may be clinically necessary to deflate the balloon partially, either to identify a bleeding focus or to permit transient reperfusion between occlusion periods. If this is required, again, any decisions must be made in conjunction with the anesthesia team, who should be ready to volume load the patient and add vasoactive medications as needed to avoid a precipitous cardiovascular collapse following balloon deflation. Furthermore, once the balloon is fully deflated, it is prudent to leave the catheter in place until the surgical or endovascular maneuvers are completed in case emergent reinflation is required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1199278486\"><span class=\"h2\">Remove the balloon catheter and sheath</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the balloon catheter and sheath are no longer required, they should be removed. The balloon catheter can be removed from the sheath without any special consideration, but sheath removal requires management of the arteriotomy. This can be accomplished by one of three methods: operative exposure and direct repair, the use of a closure device (eg, Perclose ProGlide if placed prior to sheath insertion), or direct pressure for sheath sizes of less than 7 Fr.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351707551\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data for the outcomes of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion (REBOA) are limited. In many cases, REBOA may not substantially alter the outcome, either because the patient's injuries could be handled with conventional techniques or because the injuries are devastating. As an example, in one retrospective review of 259 patients comparing REBOA and resuscitative thoracotomy, there were no differences for in-hospital mortality or other outcomes (eg, ventilator-free days, intensive care unit-free days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Survival may be improved for some patients, but identifying which patients will remain difficult. (See <a href=\"#H351701259\" class=\"local\">'Potential indications'</a> above.) </p><p>Outcomes for REBOA have been evaluated at several large trauma centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The evidence supporting REBOA is evolving and consists of observational data primarily from institutional case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/17,42,54,75,77-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,42,54,75,77-79</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Zone I &ndash; In the largest study evaluating outcomes for Zone I REBOA, 452 patients with a mean injury severity score of 36 were compared with a matched non-REBOA cohort using the Japanese Trauma Databank [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. The overall mortality rate was 76 percent. Mortality was significantly increased for those who underwent REBOA compared with those who did not (odds ratio 0.30, 95% CI 0.23-0.40). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In one report from two Level 1 trauma centers in the United States, four patients with hemorrhagic shock were treated with using Zone I REBOA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Each patient also required operative hemorrhage control with one nonhemorrhagic death due to traumatic brain injury. Three other series from Japan report on a total of 45 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/17,78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,78,79</a>]. One of these presented seven patients with solid organ and pelvic injury, each of whom was managed nonoperatively using endovascular techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. REBOA was employed during the initial resuscitation to stabilize patients, with one reported fatality. Another series described 14 patients with a mixture of abdominal injury patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. There were nine fatalities, with survivors requiring significantly shorter occlusion times (46 versus 224 minutes). A series of 24 severely injured patients with a predicted survival of 12.5 percent where REBOA was used achieved an actual survival of 29.2 percent, representing a major gain in survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. That group also reported three vascular complications resulting in lower extremity amputation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A study of patients with extrathoracic bleeding compared 24 patients undergoing REBOA with 72 patients who underwent resuscitative thoracotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The groups were well matched for injury characteristics. The mortality rate was significantly lower for the REBOA compared with resuscitative thoracotomy groups (9.7 versus 37.5 percent). Each arterial access site was repaired with open surgery, and there were no reported access site complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Zone III &ndash; Two groups have reported case series of patients with isolated pelvic fractures whose management included Zone III occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/54,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,75</a>]. The largest experience is a report of 13 patients in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The overall cohort had a high injury burden with a mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) of 48&plusmn;16 and a mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 41&plusmn;26 mmHg. The predicted survival was 39 percent with an actual survival of 46 percent. All fatalities were from hemorrhagic shock with four deaths due to a failure of hemorrhage control and three due to multiorgan failure. A later study reported two patients injured by a blunt mechanism who presented with an SBP of 70 and 85 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Following Zone III REBOA, the SBP rose to 135 and 125 mmHg respectively. Both patients went on to definitive hemostasis (pelvic angioembolization), but one of the patients eventually died from a traumatic brain injury.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351701498\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risks associated with REBOA are poorly defined. Since most patients do not have autopsy, it may be difficult to identify injuries attributable to REBOA.</p><p>Reported complications from REBOA include arterial injury at the access site or the aorta, thromboembolic complications from the balloon <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sheath, and end-organ failure. The most comprehensive report on complications in REBOA is a retrospective review that included 46 patients from the American Association for Surgery of Trauma (AAST) AORTA registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Complications of REBOA were overall uncommon and included pseudoaneurysm in 2.1 percent, embolism in 4.3 percent, and no limb ischemia events. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1199278518\"><span class=\"h1\">ONGOING CHALLENGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, the available technology was designed for balloon inflation of stent-grafts for endovascular aortic repair, most typically for aneurysmal disease. </p><p>The ideal resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion (REBOA) catheter would be low profile, with a balloon of sufficient diameter to occlude a morphologically normal aorta. Placement techniques could be improved with wires that have a low risk for side-branch cannulation in such a manner that would not require fluoroscopy. Attributes such as these would simplify and enhance the safety and ease of deployment of a REBOA catheter. Future efforts need to be directed toward proliferation of endovascular devices and methodology specifically for use in trauma. Aortic devices are just beginning to be targeted to the trauma population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-blunt-thoracic-aortic-injury#H255247669\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical and endovascular repair of blunt thoracic aortic injury&quot;, section on 'Endografts and sizing'</a>.)</p><p>As with the transition from open to endovascular repair for many vascular pathologies, trauma and acute care surgeons need to acquire the necessary guidewire and catheter skills, either through special skills training or ideally as a part of residency training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma/abstract/64,82-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,82-84</a>].</p><p>Finally, a resuscitative environment that is conducive to rapid assessment of the need for REBOA and immediate resources by which to undertake the procedure quickly are needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1199278524\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noncompressible torso hemorrhage is a leading cause of trauma mortality. Torso hemorrhage may originate from arterial, venous, or combined sources within the chest, abdomen, or pelvis or from noncompressible sites in the axilla or groin (ie, junctional hemorrhage). Management of hemorrhage generally consists of direct pressure to limit external bleeding, but the inability to directly compress vessels in the torso can lead to exsanguination. (See <a href=\"#H669602\" class=\"local\">'Torso hemorrhage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic occlusion as a part of trauma management can decrease the amount of bleeding distal to the occluded site and can provide a window of opportunity for resuscitation and definitive hemorrhage control. Options for aortic occlusion include direct clamping through an open incisional technique and resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion (REBOA). REBOA is a hemorrhage control and resuscitation adjunct that has the advantage of being less invasive than open thoracotomy, and preemptive placement prior to full cardiovascular collapse is possible. (See <a href=\"#H1199278444\" class=\"local\">'Resuscitative aortic occlusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Precise indications for REBOA in trauma remain poorly defined, but patients who are not candidates for resuscitative thoracotomy should not be considered for REBOA. Further, REBOA does <strong>not</strong> replace resuscitative thoracotomy in patients with circulatory arrest after penetrating chest trauma. REBOA can be considered for patients with abdominal or pelvic hemorrhage who have a detectable pulse but whose systolic blood pressure remains 80 mmHg or less. Thoracic aortic occlusion (Zone I) should be considered in exsanguinating abdominal injury. Infrarenal aortic occlusion (Zone III) should be considered in hypotensive patients with severe pelvic fractures. For patients with torso trauma at risk for hemorrhagic shock, access for REBOA can be obtained preemptively in the emergency department or in the operating room and used for placement of the balloon catheter should the need arise. (See <a href=\"#H351701259\" class=\"local\">'Potential indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H351707913\" class=\"local\">'Aortic anatomy and zones of deployment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The REBOA catheter is placed and positioned in a stepwise manner using fundamental endovascular techniques, ideally using fluoroscopy to guide balloon placement. The essential steps for use of a REBOA include arterial access and sheath placement (typically common femoral artery), balloon catheter insertion, balloon inflation, definitive operative hemorrhage control, balloon deflation, and sheath removal. (See <a href=\"#H351709835\" class=\"local\">'Preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with no method of aortic occlusion, REBOA is associated with significantly reduced mortality, but prolonged occlusion times are associated with increased mortality. Reported complications from REBOA include arterial injury at the access site or the aorta, thromboembolic complications from the balloon <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sheath resulting in limb ischemia, and end-organ failure. (See <a href=\"#H351707551\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further study is needed to determine the ideal timing of REBOA placement, the tolerable duration of balloon inflation, and the full spectrum of eligible patients who may benefit from this innovative resuscitative procedure.
