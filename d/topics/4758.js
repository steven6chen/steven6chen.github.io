CF-related liver disease (CFLD) is a broad term that has been used to define a spectrum of liver involvement in CF. The recognition of CFLD is increasing due to early diagnosis of CF, improved life expectancy, and greater awareness of CFLD leading to screening and monitoring for CFLD. The most significant form of CFLD is cirrhosis with or without portal hypertension. Patients with CF cirrhosis present almost exclusively during childhood, with portal hypertension and associated complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is unclear if milder forms of CFLD can identify individuals who will progress to advanced CFLD, and thus available screening tests have targeted nonspecific markers of liver involvement. Early identification of advanced CFLD (prior to the development of complications of portal hypertension) allows prospective monitoring for and treatment of complications, which include malnutrition, variceal bleeding due to portal hypertension, and occasionally liver failure. Other hepatobiliary complications of CF include cholelithiasis (gallstones), cholecystitis, and microgallbladder. </p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of CFLD will be discussed in this topic review, and associated disorders of the gallbladder will be discussed briefly. Other topic reviews relevant to the management of a patient with CF and hepatobiliary disease include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of gastrointestinal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Nutritional issues&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Assessment and management of pancreatic insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of the treatment of lung disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17458818\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term CF-related liver disease (CFLD) has been used to describe a wide range of manifestations, from common but inconsequential elevations of transaminases to cirrhosis with portal hypertension. Advanced CFLD, biliary cirrhosis, often has onset during the first decade of life and tends to progress from cirrhosis to portal hypertension by adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>CFLD has been defined as the presence of at least two of the following findings: hepatomegaly, abnormalities of liver biochemistries, characteristic abnormalities on liver ultrasound, and abnormal liver biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>] (see <a href=\"#H17461170\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below). </p><p>However, it may be useful to consider classification of liver disease using a more phenotypic description that differentiates between advanced CFLD and other forms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114904\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114904 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The prevalence of the most common forms of liver involvement in CF is shown in this table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F100004\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100004 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Mild forms of CFLD are common and are generally asymptomatic. During the first two years of life, up to 50 percent of individuals with CF have elevations of aminotransferase activity and this may be transient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/3,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,8</a>]. In two series of pediatric patients with CF who underwent rigorous screening, 30 to 40 percent exhibited some evidence of elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP), with most cases presenting within the first 12 years of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In a prospective study of children identified by newborn screen and followed for up to 20 years, 95 percent had at least one abnormal liver enzyme value, and persistently elevated AST, ALT, or GGTP occurred in up to 30 to 40 percent of individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. With the advent of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator and corrector therapies, screening for liver enzyme abnormalities will be more common as this is part of the safety monitoring for these medications. In children and adults with CF who have more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes, abnormalities are very common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Two studies have suggested that early elevations of GGTP, even persistent elevations near the upper limits of normal (ie, 35 to 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L),</span> are associated with subsequent development of advanced liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]. The frequency of ultrasound imaging abnormalities is about 20 percent, with a spectrum of abnormalities described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In autopsy studies that were performed before the modern era of CF management and outcome, focal biliary cirrhosis and fibrosis were reported in 10 to 20 percent of patients with CF by one year of age and up to 80 percent in adults; in many of these patients the liver involvement is focal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p>Noncirrhotic portal hypertension associated with focal nodular hyperplasia is increasingly found in adults with CF and appears to have a vascular component to the pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. However, this disease process appears to be distinct from the progressive cirrhosis seen in children. </p><p>Advanced CFLD (cirrhosis with portal hypertension) is the most clinically important manifestation of CFLD and is closely associated with poor outcome. CF cirrhosis occurs in 7 to 10 percent of individuals with CF, as reported by CF registries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In the modern era, about 5 percent of children &lt;13 years of age with CF have imaging findings suggestive of cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Other clinical clues to cirrhosis include low or even normal but declining platelet count and splenomegaly. Virtually all patients with advanced CFLD have severe mutations (Class I to III) in the CFTR gene, such as the F508del (delta F508) mutation, and are pancreatic insufficient. However, not all patients with these mutations develop advanced CFLD even in the same family. Additional risk factors for advanced CFLD include male gender, Hispanic ethnicity, and heterozygosity for the Pi z allele of alpha-1-antitrypsin. </p><p>Among patients with cirrhosis, variceal bleeding develops in approximately 7 percent of individuals within 10 years of being diagnosed with cirrhosis, and is the presenting feature in about one-half of those cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although the bleeding can be life-threatening, all-cause mortality is similar in individuals with CF cirrhosis with or without bleeding. CF cirrhosis is also associated with CF-related diabetes (CFRD), and both of these disorders are predictors of mortality, independent of pulmonary function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. While children or adults with CF cirrhosis may continue to have preserved synthetic liver function for many years (compensated cirrhosis), some will decompensate early in life. The majority of liver transplants for this disorder are performed in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. As an example, in the United States between 1987 and 2009, 210 children or adolescents underwent liver or liver-lung transplantation for CFLD, compared with 84 adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17458986\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the liver, CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR) is located on the apical membrane of the biliary epithelium, not in the hepatocyte. CFTR is thought to control water and solute movement through chloride and bicarbonate secretion, thus promoting bile flow. When CFTR is dysfunctional, it causes thick and tenacious bile that has less bicarbonate and congests intrahepatic bile ducts. Other factors that may contribute to the development of liver disease in CF include impaired secretion of mucins from the submucosal glands and increased glycine-conjugated bile acids. Both of these factors are thought to contribute to the decreased flow and increased viscosity of the bile. Obstruction of the biliary ductules causes the release of proinflammatory agents and growth factors that induce the synthesis of collagen in the portal tracts, leading to progressive fibrosis and eventually cirrhosis. Another proposed mechanism of liver disease in CF is the gut-liver axis theory, in which an altered gut microbiome indirectly contributes to the development of liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This mechanism has been shown to impact the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and a pilot study in CF suggests that the factors necessary (increased intestinal permeability, intestinal mucosal inflammation, and altered microbiome) exist in CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The progression to cirrhosis may be rapid or may take years to decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Interestingly, most patients with severe CF-related liver disease (CFLD) do not become classically cholestatic or jaundiced, and hepatic synthetic function usually is preserved.</p><p>Abnormalities of the hepatobiliary system occur almost solely in patients with severe CFTR mutations, which lead to the impaired synthesis, modification, or regulation of the CFTR protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, patients with the same CFTR genotype are often discordant for CFLD phenotype, suggesting that variation in genes other than CFTR may be an important determinant of susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In particular, the SERPINA1 Z allele has been associated with an increased risk for advanced CFLD, although this accounts for only a small percentage of all patients with advanced CFLD. In addition, CF-related cirrhosis and portal hypertension may accelerate at an early age in the setting of pulmonary exacerbations, repeated infections, or malnutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Other factors that may contribute to CFLD include malnutrition, essential fatty acid deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and ethanol ingestion in older patients. Each of these factors can be associated with hepatic steatosis (the accumulation of fat in the liver), which may cause elevation in liver transaminases, however, it is unclear if hepatic steatosis progresses to cirrhosis in CFLD. In CF infants with meconium ileus (MI), exposure to prolonged parenteral nutrition or a history of abdominal surgery may contribute to the development of cholestasis, which may resolve when feedings are resumed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17459020\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple presentations of liver involvement in CF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F100004\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100004 \">table 2</a>). The most clinically important form is biliary cirrhosis, which is slowly progressive and can lead to portal hypertension and nutritional issues. More common but less clinically important manifestations of liver disease include asymptomatic elevation in aminotransferases (up to 45 percent of individuals with CF) and hepatic steatosis (up to 60 percent of individuals with CF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2958358238\"><span class=\"h2\">Progression to cirrhosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>About 40 percent of individuals with CF develop clinically detectable CF-related liver disease (CFLD) during childhood or adolescence (characterized by persistently elevated aminotransferase levels, hepatomegaly, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ultrasonographic abnormalities), and about 20 percent of these (5 to 10 percent of individuals with CF) go on to develop cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Several case series that used universal screening procedures demonstrated that CF cirrhosis usually develops during childhood or adolescence, with no incident cases beyond the age of 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>]. Similarly, the CF Foundation (CFF) data registry reports approximately equal percentages of patients with CF cirrhosis (and specific manifestations thereof, such as varices) in the &lt;18 and &gt;18 age groups, suggesting that most cases present before age 18 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Noncirrhotic portal hypertension and intrahepatic cholangiopathies are disorders that are primarily found in adults with CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/18,19,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,31,32</a>]. </p><p>Liver involvement usually comes to attention when routine screening in an asymptomatic patient reveals abnormal liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alkaline phosphatase or by abnormalities on physical examination (hepatomegaly or splenomegaly). Some individuals have evidence of portal hypertension at presentation or as the disease progresses, characterized by splenomegaly, which results in splenic sequestration and therefore decreased platelet count in the peripheral blood. Serum bilirubin levels are generally not elevated until late in the disease course, as is typical for cirrhosis. Screening for and diagnosis of progressive CFLD are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H17459509\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension have associated risks for variceal hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. A large registry study reported that patients with CF cirrhosis have a 10-year cumulative risk of variceal hemorrhage of 6.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Most patients with cirrhosis remain in a state of compensated cirrhosis for years or decades. Eventually, some progress to decompensated cirrhosis, heralded by ascites, liver failure with synthetic dysfunction (coagulopathy and hypoalbuminemia), or hepatic encephalopathy. Cutaneous manifestations such as jaundice, palmar erythema, and spider hemangiomata develop late in the disease course.</p><p>Histologically, CFLD is characterized by proliferation of the bile ducts and portal fibrosis, with accumulation of amorphous pink material within the bile ducts when stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F99940\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef99940 \">picture 1</a>). In the earlier phases, the lesions may have a patchy distribution, which has been termed &quot;focal biliary cirrhosis&quot; in autopsy studies. With disease progression, cirrhosis develops, characterized (as in other forms of cirrhosis) by the development of collagenous bridges between nearly all portal and central venous areas, encircling nodules of varying sizes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F99941\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef99941 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/3,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H621670816\"><span class=\"h2\">Other manifestations of liver disease</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H621670302\"><span class=\"h3\">Neonatal cholestasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fewer than 10 percent of infants with CF develop cholestatic liver disease during the neonatal period. The majority of infants with cholestasis also have meconium ileus (MI). Those who do present in infancy present with prolonged conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Rarely, biliary obstruction can be very severe during infancy, mimicking biliary atresia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F99938\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef99938 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of cholestasis in neonates and young infants&quot;</a>). The hepatomegaly and cholestasis tend to regress during the first few months of life with improvements in nutrition, and this presentation does not predict later cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Similarly, isolated elevations in aminotransferase activity prior to two years of age are often transient and generally do not predict later CFLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. However, persistent elevations liver enzymes were associated with an increased risk for advanced CFLD in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H621670549\"><span class=\"h3\">Hepatic steatosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatic steatosis is the most commonly observed pathologic abnormality in CFLD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F99939\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef99939 \">picture 4</a>) and can be found in up to 60 percent of individuals with CF, with a wide range in prevalence depending on the patient population and methods used to determine steatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/3,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,39,40</a>]. The sonographic or histologic finding of steatosis is sometimes attributed to iatrogenic or environmental factors, particularly malnutrition and essential fatty acid deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] (see <a href=\"#H17458986\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above). The relationship between hepatic steatosis and the development of focal biliary cirrhosis in CF is unclear. Steatosis is thought to be a benign finding among children with CF. Even in severe cases, in which the steatosis becomes panacinar or more widespread, inflammation and other features of steatohepatitis generally are absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17459509\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of the evaluation is to confirm that abnormalities are due to liver involvement associated with CF and to detect advanced CF-related liver disease (CFLD) and distinguish it from other liver abnormalities that are relatively benign (eg, steatosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mild elevations of aminotransferases).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17461203\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Annual screening for CFLD is recommended for all individuals with CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/3,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination &ndash; Examine the patient for hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, noting contour, liver span, and texture by both palpation and percussion. It is important to note that hepatomegaly may be asymmetric (due to regenerative nodules), producing subxiphoid hepatomegaly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory testing &ndash; Measure platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP), and alkaline phosphatase at least annually. Abnormalities in AST, ALT, and GGTP are common in CF and have low specificity and sensitivity for CFLD. If the results are abnormal but the patient has no hepatosplenomegaly or other symptoms, it is reasonable to observe and repeat the screen 6 to 12 months later. In CFLD, GGTP or alkaline phosphatase are often elevated out of proportion to AST and ALT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A large drop in platelet count relative to baseline should be vigilantly followed up, even if does not meet laboratory criteria for thrombocytopenia, because this finding may be a harbinger of portal hypertension. Low albumin, particularly if paired with coagulopathy, is a sign of synthetic compromise and can signal decompensated cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"#H17463685\" class=\"local\">'Further evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>If the above measures are persistently abnormal, then the next step is complete abdominal ultrasonography, with or without Doppler measurements of hepatic blood flow. Ultrasonography can detect abnormalities, which include coarseness of liver parenchyma, nodularity of the liver edge, and increased periportal echogenicity, and can exclude gallstones as a cause of intermittently elevated GGTP. Whether or not ultrasound (either by itself or combined with other clinical parameters) can predict progression to cirrhosis in patients with CF is being explored in a multicenter study in a collaboration with the CF Foundation (CFF) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01144507&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPPDb/6llA8bWNb3M2xKyWjNa6nJc3vR8YNinCSB+4Yz8g==&amp;TOPIC_ID=99126\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT01144507</a>). Doppler can measure reversal of blood flow in the portal vein or a recanalized umbilical vein, which may be seen in both cirrhotic and noncirrhotic portal hypertension. Evidence of advanced CFLD includes splenomegaly, large collateral veins, or ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/3,28,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,28,43</a>]. Although uncommon, patients with right heart failure due to pulmonary disease (cor pulmonale) may have additional sonographic findings of hepatic congestion and dilated hepatic veins.

The intensity of the evaluation should be guided by the clinical presentation. In patients with persistent aminotransferase elevations, the evaluation should include a careful history, asking specifically about the neonatal course, history of jaundice, change in activity level, abdominal pain or nausea, weight loss, medication intake including over-the-counter medications and supplements, history of blood transfusions, and family history of liver disease. The physical examination includes careful evaluation for hepatosplenomegaly, and for manifestations of chronic liver disease such as jaundice, spider angiomata, palmar erythema, and ascites, although these are uncommon in CFLD. Signs or symptoms of nutritional deficiencies should also be noted.</p><p>Additional laboratory evaluation for CFLD may include markers of liver synthetic function such as albumin and prothrombin time with international normalized ratio<strong> </strong>(INR). A complete blood count, specifically platelet count, is useful to screen for hypersplenism, which is associated with portal hypertension. Screening for other causes of liver disease should be performed, including infectious hepatitis (eg, hepatitis B and C), Wilson disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, hemochromatosis, drug toxicity, and autoimmune disease.

It is clearly indicated in adults. Endoscopic band ligation should be performed for patients who have experienced prior variceal bleeding (secondary prophylaxis), particularly those who have varices with characteristics that suggest a high risk for bleeding (eg, red wale or overlying ulcer), although specific data are lacking in the CF patient population. Multiple courses of band ligation may be needed after a first variceal bleed, and tend to have a lower risk of bleeding than sclerotherapy. Although esophageal varices in adult patients without CF are often treated with nonselective beta-adrenergic blockers, these agents are generally avoided in patients with CF because of their potential to cause bronchoconstriction. Moreover, beta-adrenergic blockers usually are avoided in children with portal hypertension because children rely on reflex tachycardia to compensate for acute variceal bleeding. In an acute variceal bleed, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> may be used to decrease splanchnic flow, thus decreasing the tension on gastroesophageal varices.

They can include medical therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a> (UDCA) and antibiotics, therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and segmental liver resection. Multidisciplinary treatment approaches have demonstrated the best outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2672206304\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Among these, biliary cirrhosis is most likely to cause progressive liver disease, with associated complications and mortality. (See <a href=\"#H17459020\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cirrhosis develops in about 10 percent of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). The disease usually develops during childhood and in its most severe form progresses to portal hypertension. Most such patients remain in a state of compensated cirrhosis for years or decades. Eventually, some progress to decompensated cirrhosis, heralded by gastrointestinal bleeding, ascites, liver failure with synthetic dysfunction (coagulopathy and hypoalbuminemia) or hepatic encephalopathy. (See <a href=\"#H2958358238\" class=\"local\">'Progression to cirrhosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with CF should be evaluated annually for CFLD by examining for hepatosplenomegaly, and laboratory testing, including platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP), followed by abdominal ultrasonography, if needed. This screening process is particularly important for patients with a severe CF genotype (eg, homozygous for the F508del mutation). (See <a href=\"#H17459509\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with CFLD require rigorous nutritional management with close monitoring and supplementation of energy and fat-soluble vitamins. Those with cirrhosis should avoid nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications (NSAIDs) to minimize risks of gastrointestinal bleeding, and take measures to minimize infectious and toxic insults to the liver. (See <a href=\"#H17460874\" class=\"local\">'Nutrition'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1061654905\" class=\"local\">'Risk reduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ursodeoxycholic acid</a> (UDCA) is commonly used in the management of CFLD, but has not been adequately studied, particularly regarding whether it has a role in the treatment of subclinical or other early forms of CFLD. Limited clinical evidence suggests that UDCA at moderate doses may improve biochemical parameters in patients with CFLD. However, there is no good evidence that it improves other outcomes, and indirect evidence from other cholestatic liver diseases suggest that high doses may be detrimental.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We suggest using UDCA for children who have established cholestasis due to CFLD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>) (eg, serum conjugated bilirubin &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [17.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]),</span> treating with doses of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span>. Many clinicians do not use UDCA for children with subclinical or milder forms of CFLD, but practice varies for this group of patients; there is no specific evidence that it is harmful in CF. (See <a href=\"#H106943356\" class=\"local\">'Ursodeoxycholic acid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who develop portal hypertension are at risk for complications including hemorrhage from esophageal varices, ascites, malnutrition, hepatopulmonary syndrome, and portopulmonary hypertension; these complications may be indications for liver transplantation. Liver transplantation also may be indicated for patients with progressive hepatic dysfunction, which is suggested by falling albumin and coagulopathy. (See <a href=\"#H17460950\" class=\"local\">'Management of specific complications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17463268\" class=\"local\">'Liver transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gallbladder disease associated with CF include microgallbladder, cholelithiasis (gallstones) and cholecystitis. Evaluation and management is similar to that for patients without CF. (See <a href=\"#H15043024\" class=\"local\">'Gallbladder disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116001072\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The authors and editorial staff are grateful to Deborah Schady, MD, for providing the histologic images for this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Stonebraker JR, Ooi CY, Pace RG, et al.
