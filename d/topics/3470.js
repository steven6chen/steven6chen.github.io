In addition, the association between CKD and cardiovascular events may be stronger among black as compared with white individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/31,35,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,35,52</a>].</p><p>The best data come from a meta-analysis of general population cohorts that included 105,872 participants with urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) measurements and 1,128,310 participants with urine protein dipstick measurements; all had documented baseline estimated GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Compared with participants whose estimated GFR was 95 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, hazard ratios (HR) for all-cause mortality during 7.9 years of follow-up were 1.18 (95% CI 1.05-1.32), 1.57 (95% CI 1.39-1.78), and 3.14 (95% CI 2.39-4.13) for estimated GFRs of 60, 45, and 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. Similar outcomes were observed for cardiovascular mortality, and similar results were obtained in older and younger individuals (age greater than 65 years versus 65 years or less). A higher risk for all-cause mortality was observed at estimated GFRs greater than 105 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>; however, this association may reflect either reduced muscle mass from ill health leading to a lower creatinine value, or a high prevalence of individuals with diabetes or obesity causing hyperfiltration and a low creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Proteinuria was independently associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Compared with an albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) of 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mmol</span> (6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g),</span> the adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was 1.20 (95% CI 1.15-1.26); 1.63 (95% CI 1.50-1.77); and 2.20 (95% CI 1.97-2.51) for ACRs of 1.1 (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g);</span> 3.4 (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g);</span> and 33.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mmol</span> (300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g),</span> respectively. Similar findings were observed for cardiovascular mortality. An ACR greater than 3.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mmol</span> (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g)</span> was associated with a greater than twofold mortality risk for all levels of estimated GFR except the lowest (&lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). Among participants with dipstick determination of proteinuria, a trace urine positive dipstick was also associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality for all levels of kidney function, although large heterogeneity was present between studies that provided only dipstick measurement of protein.</p><p>Given that CKD alone appears to increase the risk of CHD in the general population, it is not surprising that the Framingham risk score, the traditional method to analyze future cardiovascular risk among individuals without CKD, provides poor overall accuracy in predicting cardiovascular events in patients with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>], while inclusion of estimated GFR and ACR with traditional cardiovascular risk factors improves the ability to forecast events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. This may be partly due to the markedly increased cardiac event rate and overall death rate among such patients. Attempts have been made to improve the predictive accuracy of the Framingham risk equations by including renal parameters. Such efforts have been successful in some but not all populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/55,58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,58,59</a>], suggesting that new prediction equations must be developed to help predict future events among patients with CKD.</p><p>Despite the preponderance of evidence in favor of an increase in risk with CKD alone, a few studies have found that less severe renal disease is not an independent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Association between CKD and CHD among those at high cardiovascular risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous secondary analyses of studies that enrolled patients with known risk factors for cardiovascular disease (such as hypertension and diabetes), or preexisting cardiovascular disease, have shown that the presence or development of various degrees of renal dysfunction is independently associated with cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/18,50,51,57,62-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,50,51,57,62-72</a>]. In addition, accounting for estimated GFR and ACR in conjunction with traditional risk factors improves the ability to predict cardiovascular events in patients at high cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>The magnitude of the association of kidney function, albuminuria, and outcomes was illustrated in a collaborative meta-analysis of 10 cohorts with 266,975 patients who had hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or a combination of these disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Compared with a reference estimated GFR of 95 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, the hazard ratios for cardiovascular mortality were 1.11 for an estimated GFR of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, 1.73 for an estimated GFR of 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and 3.08 for an estimated GFR of 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Similar findings were noted for all-cause mortality, and the associations were similar in younger and older patients. A monotonic association between higher ACR and risk of both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality was also noted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">CKD as a CHD risk equivalent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The above evidence that mild to moderate CKD is associated with an adverse cardiovascular prognosis led both the National Kidney Foundation and the American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association to recommend that CKD be considered a CHD risk equivalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/1,73-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,73-76</a>]. Consistent with this, the number of cardiovascular events attributable to CKD in the Alberta Kidney Disease Network and Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC) studies were comparable to the number of events attributable to diabetes, another factor considered to be a CHD risk equivalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/35,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,77</a>].</p><p>In addition, the nine-year rates of cardiovascular death among 1899 individuals in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) were as follows (CKD was defined as an estimated GFR less than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of myocardial infarction, but no diabetes or CKD: 15.7 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of diabetes, but no myocardial infarction or CKD: 15.8 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of CKD, but no myocardial infarction or diabetes: 13 percent</p><p/><p>Although CKD was a powerful risk factor for cardiovascular disease in these and other studies, the generalization that CKD is a CHD risk equivalent for all persons with CKD may not be warranted for several reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some studies contradict the concept that CKD is a CHD risk equivalent. In the Alberta Kidney Disease Network cohort, for example, the four-year incidence of myocardial infarction was nearly threefold higher among those who had a prior history of myocardial infarction (7.7 percent) compared with those without a prior history of myocardial infarction but who had CKD (2.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. The incidence of myocardial infarction among those who had a prior history of myocardial infarction but no diabetes and no CKD was more than twice the incidence among those with CKD but not prior myocardial infarction. Similarly, a secondary analysis from the ARIC study suggested that the risk associated with CKD was not comparable to the risk associated with a prior myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of heart disease in those with CKD appears to vary based upon absolute level of renal function and degree of proteinuria, as well as the rate at which these factors change. The simultaneous presence of both decreased renal function and increased proteinuria further enhance the risk for cardiovascular disease compared with the risk associated with either problem alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/19-21,62,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21,62,77</a>]. In addition, the rate of decline of kidney function and the rate of increase of proteinuria also correlate with varying risks of adverse cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/80-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">80-82</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Even patients with the same degree of renal dysfunction may <strong>not</strong> have the same risk of cardiovascular disease since the risk of cardiovascular disease in a patient with CKD is in part related to the presence and extent of significant comorbidities. As an example, the overall risk for a 25-year-old nonsmoking man with moderate CKD due to IgA nephropathy is not the same as that of a 65-year-old man with a similar degree of CKD but with a long history of smoking, hypertension, and elevated serum cholesterol levels. Thus, the proper assessment of overall cardiovascular risk in patients with CKD requires an adequate assessment for the presence and severity of the other major risk factors for cardiovascular disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of established risk factors for cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The concept of CHD risk equivalency was developed by expert panels as a means to help clinicians make decisions about how aggressively to treat their patients to prevent CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. As an example, while it is fairly simple to identify a patient who has diabetes or CKD, and thus institute aggressive therapy for secondary prevention of CHD, it is more cumbersome to calculate every patient's 10-year cardiovascular risk. Approximately half of adults in the United States with CKD have another CHD risk equivalent, specifically a prior history of myocardial infarction or stroke, diabetes, angina, or a calculated Framingham 10-year CHD risk greater than 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Thus, the question of whether CKD is a CHD risk equivalent is germane to whether millions of additional patients with CKD should receive aggressive therapy to lower their LDL cholesterol and blood pressure, and whether they should receive antiplatelet therapy. In general, many expert panels are moving away from the concept of &quot;risk equivalency&quot; and are, instead, basing their recommendations for preventative therapies upon the predicted 10-year CHD risk. These issues are discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Reduction of CHD risk in patients with CKD'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations of the data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One possible limitation in nearly all of the above reports is that kidney function was indirectly estimated. Since the various estimates provide results that may differ from each other, the association between kidney function and cardiovascular risk is affected by the method selected to estimate kidney function. The association may be further compromised because some of the formulas utilized are based directly upon variables linked with cardiovascular risk, such as age, weight, and body mass index.</p><p>This difficulty was shown using data from 8592 participants in the PREVEND study, in which the association between various cardiovascular risk factors and kidney function was examined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86</a>]. Kidney function was estimated using creatinine clearance (based upon two 24-hour urine collections), and the Cockcroft-Gault and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]; the various cardiovascular risk factors examined included blood pressure, serum cholesterol and glucose levels, age, sex, weight, waist-to-hip ratio, and body mass index. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function#H20659769\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;, section on 'Estimation equations'</a>.)</p><p>Markedly different relationships emerged when each method for estimating kidney function was plotted against each cardiovascular risk factor. These varied relationships were most pronounced for age, weight, and body mass index, and less pronounced (but still statistically significant) for blood pressure, and serum cholesterol and glucose levels. As a result, caution must be exercised when studying the relationships among cardiovascular risk factors, indirect estimates of kidney function, and cardiovascular risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H786389950\"><span class=\"h3\">Cystatin C and other markers of kidney function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another potential limitation of kidney function estimates in the vast majority of studies mentioned above is that level of GFR may not be accurately assessed using creatinine-based equations, particularly in those with estimated GFR values greater than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. In these individuals, cystatin C and other markers of kidney function (such as beta-trace protein and beta-2-microglobulin) may be more sensitive measures of decreased GFR, and also more strongly associated with fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, than creatinine and creatinine-based estimates of GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/41-48,87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-48,87,88</a>]. As an example, the risk of death relative to the cystatin C concentration increased in a dose-response fashion in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Relative to the first quintile, the adjusted hazard ratio of cardiovascular death for the third, fourth, and fifth quintiles (the fifth quintile further subdivided into thirds) of cystatin C levels were 1.93, 1.99, and 2.48 to 2.83, respectively. In contrast, a significant association with adverse outcomes was only observed among those in the lowest quintile of GFR estimated from the plasma creatinine concentration. In addition, compared with creatinine-based estimation of GFR, estimation using a cystatin C-based equation improves risk stratification for mortality, cardiovascular events, and end-stage renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;, section on 'Serum cystatin C'</a>.)</p><p>These results suggest that elevated plasma cystatin C concentration may be a more accurate measure of cardiovascular risk than elevated plasma creatinine concentration. However, some have postulated that non-renal determinants of cystatin C levels, such as increased inflammation and other cardiovascular factors, may underlie this association. In addition, cystatin C is not routinely used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H599735133\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESENCE OF TRADITIONAL AND NONTRADITIONAL CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS IN CKD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with CKD often have numerous traditional and nontraditional risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease. Traditional risk factors appear to be associated with much larger absolute increases in risk in the earlier stages of CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H599735140\"><span class=\"h2\">Traditional risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension (which may be accompanied by left ventricular hypertrophy), smoking, diabetes, dyslipidemia and older age, are highly prevalent in CKD populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/1,90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,90,91</a>]. The number of cardiovascular risk factors appears to correlate with the severity of kidney dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. These are discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-acute-and-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in acute and chronic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of established risk factors for cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with CKD are also more likely to have the metabolic syndrome, which could contribute to the increase in cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/3,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,92</a>]. This syndrome is defined as some combination of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, elevated serum glucose, abdominal obesity, and hypertension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-metabolic-syndrome-insulin-resistance-syndrome-or-syndrome-x\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance syndrome or syndrome X)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H599735147\"><span class=\"h2\">Nontraditional risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Possible risk factors that are relatively unique to patients with moderate to severe CKD include retention of uremic toxins, anemia, elevated levels of certain cytokines, positive calcium balance, abnormalities in bone mineral metabolism, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an &quot;increased inflammatory-poor nutrition&quot; state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/4,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,93</a>]. How these risk factors may lead to cardiovascular disease is unclear. As an example, disorders of bone mineral metabolism in patients with CKD have often been linked to coronary artery calcification. However, while there is a consistent association between CKD and a higher burden of coronary artery calcification, the associations among phosphorus, calcium, and parathyroid hormone with coronary artery calcification in these patients is inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/94-96\" class=\"abstract_t\">94-96</a>].

Hyperhomocysteinemia has also been inconsistently associated with increased cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/100-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">100-102</a>].</p><p>There is also a relationship between cardiovascular disease and moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria&quot;) among nondiabetic patients with normal estimated GFR. However, some disagree with the <span class=\"nowrap\">K/DOQI</span> and KDIGO working groups that isolated moderately increased albuminuria (ie, without a reduction in GFR or some other renal abnormality) necessarily reflects kidney disease among nondiabetic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

The risk of death, particularly due to cardiovascular disease, is typically higher than the risk of eventually requiring renal replacement therapy. However, this risk varies with age and other factors. In many studies, older patients with less severe CKD and lower levels of proteinuria are more likely to die (usually due to cardiovascular disease) before needing renal replacement therapy, while younger patients with proteinuria and diseases localized to the kidney are more likely to ultimately need renal replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/18,53,69,103-107\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,53,69,103-107</a>].

A 2006 survey of the published literature noted that 75 percent of coronary artery disease trials excluded patients with CKD and only 7 percent reported baseline renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>].

We do not agree with applying this paradigm to all patients. As an example, it is unknown whether a 25-year-old nonsmoker with IgA nephropathy, normal serum creatinine concentration, and normal blood pressure is at increased cardiovascular risk in the absence of progressive disease. Such patients should clearly be followed carefully and patient values should be taken into account when considered how aggressively one would modify coronary risk factors.

One randomized trial, the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) trial, specifically evaluated cholesterol lowering with a statin to prevent major vascular events in patients with CKD.</p><p>The findings from the SHARP trial echoed the observations made in CKD subgroups from other randomized trials: treatment of patients with CKD not requiring dialysis with a statin leads to a significant reduction in cardiovascular events. Patients who received statin therapy in SHARP also received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a>, although it is not clear if ezetimibe contributed to the clinical benefit. A detailed discussion of these findings and recommendations regarding statin use in CKD are presented elsewhere.

Whether statin therapy would be beneficial in younger patients who have CKD due to primary kidney disease (such as IgA nephropathy or autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease) rather than a systemic disease (such as diabetes) is unclear. We would initiate statin therapy in most patients who have an estimated GFR less than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> ; detailed recommendations are presented elsewhere.

When the results of multiple trials are considered, each using a fixed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a> dose, the rate of major cardiovascular events falls linearly with the reduction in LDL cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. However, there is as yet no good evidence that titrating statin therapy to achieve specific target LDL levels in patients at increased cardiovascular risk is associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes. Hence, the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines on management of dyslipidemia in CKD did not base their suggestions upon target levels of LDL cholesterol. Rather, they recommend standard doses based upon cardiovascular risk and level of estimated GFR.

However, no specific antihypertensive drug (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) provides preferential cardiovascular benefit, at least in patients with non-proteinuric CKD.

However, antiplatelet therapy also significantly increased the rate of major bleeding (4.4 versus 2.9 percent, or 15 additional major bleeding events for every 1000 patients treated). Antiplatelets had no effect on stroke or mortality.

As an example, a study of 889 patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) evaluated the association between renal dysfunction, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and in-hospital management and outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Renal dysfunction was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving percutaneous coronary intervention, and a reduction in the use of a GP <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> inhibitor, although the frequency of coronary artery bypass grafting was similar in those with and without renal dysfunction. Less frequent utilization of angiography, revascularization, and standard medical therapy (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta blockers) in CKD patients after ACS has also been observed in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-kidney-disease-and-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/123,124\" class=\"abstract_t\">123,124</a>].</p><p>However, not all of the usual treatments used in patients with normal renal function should be universally applied in patients with CKD.

The mechanisms which underlie the poor prognosis in patients with CKD are not entirely clear.</p><p>One possibility is that patients who have a coronary event and abnormal kidney function are more likely to have other predictors of adverse outcomes such as older age, hypotension, and lower body weight; these factors may confound the associations observed in the various studies despite statistical adjustment. A second potential explanation is that the adverse outcome (eg, death, recurrent vascular event) ascribed to worse kidney function may instead reflect a more severe acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Because only baseline creatinine values (at the time of presentation with an ACS) were used in most studies to define the presence of CKD, patients with hemodynamic compromise would have been more likely to be defined as having CKD. The formulas used to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) based upon serum creatinine are predicated on there being a <strong>stable</strong> creatinine concentration.

These associations have been shown in both community-based populations (ie, cohorts that were not selected specifically to enroll individuals with chronic kidney disease [CKD] or cardiovascular disease) and in populations of patients at high cardiovascular risk (ie, cohorts in which patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular disease risk factors were specifically recruited). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Chronic kidney disease as an independent risk factor for CHD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with CKD often have numerous traditional and nontraditional risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease. Traditional risk factors (hypertension, smoking, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and older age) appear to be more important risk factors during the earlier stages of CKD. Nontraditional risk factors include uremic toxins, anemia, elevated levels of certain cytokines, an increased calcium load, abnormalities in bone mineral metabolism, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an increased inflammatory-poor nutrition state.

However, this risk varies with age and other factors. In many studies, older patients with less severe CKD and lower levels of proteinuria are more likely to die (usually due to cardiovascular disease) before needing renal replacement therapy, while younger patients with proteinuria and diseases localized to the kidney are more likely to ultimately need renal replacement therapy.
