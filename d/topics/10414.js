In women with a history of heart failure (HF) or other cardiovascular disorders, these demands can lead to clinical decompensation. In addition, women without a history of cardiovascular disease can develop HF due to diseases acquired during pregnancy, such as peripartum cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Cardiovascular and hemodynamic changes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peripartum cardiomyopathy: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HF is a complex clinical syndrome that can result from any structural or functional cardiac disorder that impairs the ability of the ventricle to fill with or eject blood. It is characterized by specific symptoms, such as dyspnea and fatigue, and signs, such as fluid retention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because of concerns related to potential adverse effects on the fetus and the mother, medication use to treat HF during pregnancy is challenging. This is an important issue in women with both chronic and acute HF. For example, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor which are part of the standard long-term therapeutic regimen in nonpregnant patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction, are <strong>contraindicated</strong> during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and receptor blockers in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Management of women with HF who are breastfeeding requires consideration of the levels of drugs in breast milk with possible adverse effects in the nursing infant as well as potential effects of medications on lactation.</p><p>The evaluation and management of HF during pregnancy and breastfeeding will be reviewed here. The general approach to pregnancy in women with known congenital or acquired heart disease, treatment of peripartum cardiomyopathy, treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy during pregnancy, and overviews of the management of acute and chronic HF are presented separately.

HF is also classified as being predominantly right <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> left sided. In women of childbearing age with congenital heart disease, right HF is an important issue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic versus acute conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Issues related to HF management arise in two types of settings in women who are pregnant or considering pregnancy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with a history of chronic HF or other cardiovascular disorders can present in a stable condition either prior to or in the early stages of pregnancy. In such patients, management focuses on the adjustment of chronic medical therapies and monitoring for decompensation.<br/><br/>Conditions that increase the risk of developing HF during pregnancy include cardiomyopathy (eg, dilated cardiomyopathy or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis, and severe mitral or aortic regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-heart-failure-during-pregnancy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In addition, the growing population of adult women with congenital heart disease includes some at risk of HF during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-heart-failure-during-pregnancy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Ischemic heart disease is uncommon in this population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired heart disease and pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-congenital-heart-disease-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with congenital heart disease: General principles&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women can present with decompensated HF during pregnancy or in the peripartum period. Such decompensation can occur in patients with pre-existing disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-heart-failure-during-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], or it can be the result of disease acquired during pregnancy. Because pregnancy can be proarrhythmic, women with pre-existing lesions such as mitral stenosis can develop arrhythmias during pregnancy that precipitate HF. Examples of cardiovascular disorders that can develop during pregnancy include peripartum cardiomyopathy, infective endocarditis, sepsis, and pericardial disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peripartum cardiomyopathy: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61508265\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HF can occur with a reduced LVEF (HFrEF with LVEF &le;40 percent) or preserved EF (HFpEF with LVEF &ge;50 percent); HF with LVEF of 41 to 49 percent is generally considered borderline HFpEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-heart-failure-during-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The LVEF is most commonly determined by echocardiography.

Stable as well as decompensated patients require joint cardiac and obstetric care, including baseline and follow-up maternal transthoracic echocardiograms as well as fetal ultrasound examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-heart-failure-during-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Stable patient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with a history of HF or other cardiovascular disorders often present in a stable, well-compensated condition prior to or in the early stages of pregnancy. The initial approach to such patients involves assessing the cardiovascular risks associated with pregnancy and discussing these risks with the patient. There are increased risks for both the mother and for the <span class=\"nowrap\">fetus/neonate</span> (low birth <span class=\"nowrap\">weight/prematurity)</span>.

However, nitroprusside should be used only when all other interventions have failed and when it is essential for maternal well&ndash;being. Even under these conditions, the dose and duration of therapy should be minimized due to the metabolism of this agent to thiocyanate and cyanide, which has resulted in fetal cyanide poisoning in animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-heart-failure-during-pregnancy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].
