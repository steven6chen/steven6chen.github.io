It may cause significant symptoms and impair both functional status and quality of life. Without therapeutic intervention, affected patients are at increased risk for mortality (1.5- to 1.9-fold in the Framingham Heart Study) and morbidity (thromboembolic events and limiting symptoms). </p><p>In AF, the loss of the regular and organized contraction of the left atrium as well as the subsequent increase in ventricular rate, lead to both immediate and long-term adverse consequences: deterioration in hemodynamics secondary to increased heart rate and loss of atrioventricular (AV) synchrony, an increased risk for stroke and other embolic events from left atrial thrombi, and progressive dysfunction of the left atrium and left ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H5421069\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> below.)</p><p>For each patient with AF, a decision should be made as to which approach will be used for long-term management. The following points should be kept in mind irrespective of strategy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both strategies can fail both in the short and long terms. As a consequence many patients need to be reconsidered for the alternate strategy as the natural history of their disease progresses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with AF, irrespective of strategy <span class=\"nowrap\">chosen/rhythm,</span> should have their thromboembolic risk assessed and be managed accordingly.

This issue is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-new-onset-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of new onset atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5421069\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A rhythm-control strategy uses antiarrhythmic drug therapy, radiofrequency catheter ablation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a surgical procedure performed at the time of open heart surgery to maintain sinus rhythm (SR). Many patients who remain in SR require rate slowing drugs (in the event of return to atrial fibrillation [AF]) long term as well as chronic antithrombotic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H5421857\" class=\"local\">'Thromboembolic risk'</a> below.)</p><p>A rate-control strategy uses drugs that block (slow conduction through) the atrioventricular (AV) node such as beta blockers, rate-slowing calcium channel blockers, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>. AV nodal ablation plus ventricular pacing to control symptoms is also considered when pharmacologic therapy is ineffective. Rate control goals are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Pharmacologic therapy&quot;, section on 'Rate control goals'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5421857\"><span class=\"h1\">THROMBOEMBOLIC RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thromboembolism is the most important adverse outcome of atrial fibrillation (AF). Unfortunately, clinical maintenance of sinus rhythm (SR) does not reduce the frequency of clinical thromboembolization. The AFFIRM and RACE trials demonstrated that embolic events occurred with equal frequency regardless of whether a rate control or rhythm-control strategy was pursued; furthermore, most embolic events (113 of 157 ischemic strokes in AFFIRM and 29 of 35 embolic events in RACE) occurred after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> had been stopped or when the International Normalized Ratio (INR) was subtherapeutic (less than 2.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. These findings indicate that at-risk patients in whom a rhythm-control strategy is pursued still require chronic anticoagulation, even if it seems that SR is maintained. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are at least three explanations for the failure of rhythm control to reduce embolic risk:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite successful cardioversion and antiarrhythmic drug therapy, the recurrence rate of either intermittent (paroxysmal) or persistent (chronic) AF is 35 to 60 percent at one year with intermittent monitoring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69285\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69285 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>] and up to 88 percent with continuous monitoring (permanent pacemaker with AF detection function and electrogram storage) for more than 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In the AFFIRM trial described below, there was a high crossover rate from rhythm to rate control (17 and 38 percent of patients at one and five years), due primarily to inability to maintain SR and drug intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. <br/><br/>Up to 90 percent of recurrences are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] (likely because of the use of rate controlling medications) and asymptomatic episodes lasting more than 48 hours are not uncommon, occurring in 17 percent of patients in a report using continuous monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. During these prolonged episodes of AF, left atrial thrombi can form that may cause clinical thromboembolism. The continuous monitoring study also showed that 40 percent of patients had episodes of AF-like symptoms in the absence of AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Even very brief episodes of AF can increase stroke risk. In a study using pacemakers for arrhythmia detection in patients without a history of AF, AF duration for greater than five minutes increased the risk of thromboembolic events sixfold compared with patients with similar or greater CHADS2 score and no detected AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with nonvalvular AF that is not due to a reversible disease (eg, hyperthyroidism, cardiac surgery) often have other predisposing factors for thromboembolism even when they are in SR. These include complex aortic plaque and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombotic therapy in patients with heart failure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from aortic plaque: Thromboembolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>There may be discordance between the body of the left atrium, demonstrating sinus mechanism, while the atrial appendage displays an AF contraction pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thus, the implementation of either strategy requires the assessment of the need for antithrombotic therapy. Issues related to risk stratification and the approach to antithrombotic therapy in patients with AF are discussed in detail separately.

The recommended approach to such patients is presented separately.

Two large trials, AFFIRM and RACE, will be discussed in detail. One trial demonstrated improved quality-of-life scores with rhythm control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A large, 2012 observational study found a lower risk of death at both five and eight years of follow-up with rhythm control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">AFFIRM trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AFFIRM, the largest trial, randomly assigned 4060 patients with recurrent AF to rate control (using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, beta blocker, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> calcium channel blocker) and anticoagulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or to rhythm control with the most effective antiarrhythmic drug, with the use of warfarin left up to the discretion of the investigator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients had to be at least 65 years of age (mean age 70) or have other risk factors for stroke or death and there could be no contraindications to antiarrhythmic or anticoagulation therapy. All patients were initially anticoagulated, but those in the rhythm control arm who maintained sinus rhythm (SR) could be withdrawn from warfarin.</p><p>In the rate control arm of the study, the goals were a ventricular rate of 80 beats per min at rest and 110 beats per minute during a six-minute walk test. At five years, 35 percent of patients were in SR (compared to 63 percent with rhythm control), while over 80 percent of those still in AF had &quot;adequate heart rate control.&quot; Over 85 percent of patients in the rate control arm were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>. Radiofrequency ablation of the atrioventricular node (AV) was required in 105 patients (5 percent) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Nonpharmacologic therapy&quot;</a>).</p><p>In the rhythm control arm of the study, SR was maintained in 82 and 63 percent of patients at one and five years; only 1 percent underwent nonpharmacologic therapy to maintain rhythm control. The most frequently used initial antiarrhythmic drugs were <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> (38 percent) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> (31 percent). By the end of 3.5 years of follow-up, 63 percent of patients had had at least one trial of amiodarone.</p><p>Among patients initially assigned to rhythm control, crossover to rate control occurred in 17 and 38 percent of patients at one and five years, primarily due to inability to maintain SR and drug intolerance. In those originally assigned to rate control, the crossover rate to rhythm control was lower at 8 and 15 percent, primarily due to failure to control symptoms due to AF and heart failure.</p><p>After a mean follow-up of 3.5 years, the following findings were observed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was a trend toward a decrease in the rate of occurrence of the primary end point (all-cause mortality) with rate control (21.3 versus 23.8 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 0.87, 95% CI 0.75-1.01) &#160;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61608\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61608 \">figure 2</a>). There was no difference between the two groups in the incidence of cardiac death, arrhythmic death, or deaths due to ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Two prespecified subgroups had a significant reduction in mortality with rate control: those without a history of heart failure (adjusted HR 0.69) and those aged 65 years or older (HR 0.76) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was no significant difference in the composite secondary end point of death, ischemic stroke, anoxic encephalopathy, major bleeding, or cardiac arrest. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was no significant difference in global functional status or quality of life in the initial report. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The number of patients requiring hospitalization during follow-up was significantly lower in the rate control group than in the rhythm control group (73 versus 80 percent).</p><p/><p>A subsequent report provided evidence that the trend toward increased mortality with rhythm control was due to the deleterious effects of antiarrhythmic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In this analysis, the use of antiarrhythmic drugs was associated with a significant increase in mortality (HR 1.49), while the presence of SR was associated with a significant reduction in mortality (hazard ratio 0.53). It could not be determined if the latter effect was due to SR itself or to AF being a marker for a confounding factor or factors that affect survival, such as heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">RACE trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The RACE trial enrolled 522 patients (mean age 68) with recurrent persistent AF or atrial flutter less than one year in duration who had required one to two cardioversions within the prior two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-fibrillation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>.)</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned to rate control using the same AV nodal blocking drugs as used in AFFIRM or to rhythm control. Successful rate control was defined as a ventricular rate below 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> and no symptoms. Initial therapy for rhythm control was <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>. If AF recurred within six months, antiarrhythmic drug therapy was changed; if AF again recurred within six months, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> was substituted. A late recurrence, after more than six months of therapy, was treated with repeat cardioversion and continuation of the same antiarrhythmic agent.</p><p>The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, admission for heart failure, thromboembolic event, severe bleeding, pacemaker implantation, or severe side effects from antiarrhythmic drugs. After a mean 2.3-year follow-up, the following findings were observed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significantly fewer patients were in SR in the rate control group (10 versus 39 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was an almost significant trend toward a lower incidence of the primary end point with rate control (17.2 versus 22.6 percent with rhythm control, HR 0.73, 90% CI 0.53-1.01) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74434\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74434 \">figure 3</a>). There was no difference in cardiovascular mortality (6.8 versus 7 percent).

Improvement in quality of life was associated with symptomatic AF at baseline, a short duration of AF, and the presence of SR at the end of follow-up, rather than the assigned strategy.</p><p/><p>It has been thought that restoration and maintenance of SR may be of particular importance in patients with cardiomyopathy and symptomatic heart failure who have AF, based upon the expectation that hemodynamics would improve and heart failure would be more easily controlled in such patients if they were in sinus rhythm.

After a mean follow-up of 3.1 years, the following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Death occurred in 49.5 percent of the entire cohort (the mean age at baseline was 79 years).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiarrhythmic medication was prescribed in 24.5 percent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the first six months, there was a small increase in the risk of death for patients treated with rhythm control (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.14).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality was similar between the two groups until year four. However, the relative risk of death, comparing rhythm to rate control, fell thereafter and the risk was lower at five and eight years (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.96 and 0.77, 95% CI 0.62-0.95, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The data from the clinical trials suggest that both rate and rhythm control are acceptable approaches, with comparable rates of mortality and stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/11,12,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,20</a>]. As discussed below, we prefer a rate-control strategy in most relatively asymptomatic patients with rhythm control in symptomatic patients.</p><p>However, an individual patient may do better with one or the other, and in many cases only after trying one strategy is utility known. When choosing a strategy, the major factors that should be considered are the relative ability of each strategy to control symptoms and the relative burdens imposed by each.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Preference for rate control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most asymptomatic patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), particularly recurrent AF, we prefer rate control as the initial approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/19,21,22,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21,22,27</a>].

A meta-analysis of above five trials, in which AFFIRM accounted for 77 percent of the patients, found a strong trend toward a reduction in all-cause mortality with rate control (13.0 versus 14.6 percent with rhythm control, odds ratio 0.87, 95% CI 0.74-1.02) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Thus, many experts see the failure to demonstrate improved outcomes with rhythm-control strategies as a reflection of the inadequacies of available therapies, rather than a clinical equivalence between AF with rate control and sinus rhythm.</p><p>Despite the general preference for a rate-control strategy, and the difficulty in demonstrating improved outcomes with rhythm control, there are several situations in which rhythm control is preferable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Failure of rate control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two manifestations of failure of rate control:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent symptoms (palpitations, dyspnea, lightheadedness, angina, and near syncope) despite adequate rate control.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodynamic-consequences-of-atrial-fibrillation-and-cardioversion-to-sinus-rhythm#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodynamic consequences of atrial fibrillation and cardioversion to sinus rhythm&quot;, section on 'Adverse hemodynamics in AF'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rhythm- and rate-control strategies are associated with similar rates of mortality and serious morbidity, such as embolic risk, which is best addressed using anticoagulation based on the CHADS2 or CHA2DS2-VASc criteria. (See <a href=\"#H5421857\" class=\"local\">'Thromboembolic risk'</a> above.)<br/><br/>In addition, assessments of quality of life have not shown significant differences between the two in most studies. (See <a href=\"#H5421069\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)<br/><br/>A rate-control strategy generally uses drugs that block the atrioventricular (AV) node, such as beta blockers, rate-slowing calcium channel blockers, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>. AV nodal ablation plus ventricular pacing is another option.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The principal reasons to prefer a rate-control strategy include simplification of the medical regimen, lower cost, and less concern about the risks of antiarrhythmic drug therapy (such as torsades de pointes) or radiofrequency catheter ablation. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Preference for rate control'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients managed by either rate or rhythm control must be assessed for their thromboembolic risk. Therapy should be initiated when appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H5421857\" class=\"local\">'Thromboembolic risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic AF patients who are 65 years or older, we suggest a rate-control as opposed to a rhythm-control strategy using medical therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). This recommendation places a high priority on concerns about side effects of antiarrhythmic drug therapy or radiofrequency catheter ablation. Patients for whom a rhythm-control strategy may be reasonable include those who continue with clinically significant symptoms on a rate-control strategy. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Preference for rate control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with AF younger than age 65, particularly those who are symptomatic, we suggest a rhythm control as opposed to a rate-control strategy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). This recommendation places a high priority on relief of symptoms as well as the potential, but as of yet unproven benefit, from remaining in sinus rhythm over long periods of time. For younger, asymptomatic patients who are concerned about the potential side effects of antiarrhythmic drug therapy, and who are not inclined to undergo radiofrequency catheter ablation, a rate-control strategy is reasonable. In these patients, an informed discussion of the benefits and risks of antiarrhythmic drug therapy is critically important.
