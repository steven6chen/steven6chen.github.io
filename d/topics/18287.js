The scale can be completed in less than five minutes in the waiting room immediately before seeing the clinician. Although the instrument was originally developed as a screening tool, we find it is also useful for monitoring response to treatment. Items asking about the somatic symptoms of depression such as sleep and appetite are not included in the scale because these symptoms are common in pregnant women who are not depressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-pregnant-women-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The scale is acceptable to most women and clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-pregnant-women-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], easy to score, and is available in over 50 languages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-pregnant-women-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Responses are scored 0, 1, 2, or 3, with a maximum score of 30. In studies that evaluated the instrument as a screening tool, scores &ge;12 or 13 identified most women with major depression. However, many studies used a cutoff score of &ge;10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-pregnant-women-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>An alternative to the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale is the self-report, nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 2</a>). However, the Patient Health Questionnaire includes items about changes in appetite, energy, and sleep, which may reflect the physical effects of pregnancy rather than depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-pregnant-women-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>General information about monitoring depressive symptoms during treatment is discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-antenatal-unipolar-major-depression-treatment#H2096812256\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe antenatal unipolar major depression: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Weighing the risks'</a>.) </p><p>Antenatal major depression is frequently managed with pharmacotherapy. In a nationally representative survey in the United States that identified pregnant women who were treated for major depression (n = 375), the most common form of treatment was medications (received by 40 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-pregnant-women-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, it is estimated that among all pregnant women in the United States, antidepressants are used by more than 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-pregnant-women-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. However, the stigma and shame that is associated with depression can be exacerbated during pregnancy, and may lead women to avoid using pharmacotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-pregnant-women-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/21,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,31</a>].</p><p>Although it is not clear if the effectiveness of antidepressants is the same in pregnant and nonpregnant women, we generally look to the data from the general population of adults. One indication that antidepressants have their expected effect in antenatal depression is the observation that discontinuation of antidepressants during pregnancy is associated with depressive relapses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-antenatal-unipolar-major-depression-treatment#H3665802262\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe antenatal unipolar major depression: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Unplanned pregnancies and discontinuing antidepressants during pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p>For depressed, pregnant women who are treated with antidepressants, we suggest that clinicians attempt to minimize fetal exposure by using monotherapy and doses at the low end of the therapeutic range, especially during the first trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-pregnant-women-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/4,8,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,32,33</a>]. As an example, in managing depression with insomnia, it may be feasible to select a sedating antidepressant, rather than a more activating drug combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trazodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trazodone</a> or a benzodiazepine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-pregnant-women-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>We suggest initiating antidepressants at low doses (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> at 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a> at 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-pregnant-women-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. One reason is that the gastrointestinal side effects of some antidepressants may be aggravated during pregnancy. However, in prescribing the lowest effective dose, it is important to strive for remission and to avoid inadequate doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-pregnant-women-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/8,21,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,21,35,36</a>]. There is little to no evidence that lower doses decrease the risk of adverse obstetrical and neonatal outcomes. In addition, undertreatment exposes the fetus to both the medication and the mother&rsquo;s persistent depression. </p><p>Antidepressant drug doses may need to be increased as the pregnancy progresses, because prenatal pharmacokinetic changes may decrease antidepressant serum concentrations and possibly diminish treatment effects, especially during the third trimester. A literature review of prospective and retrospective studies found that pregnancy was associated with increased activity of hepatic enzymes induced by hormones, as well as an increased volume of distribution and increased hepatic and renal blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-pregnant-women-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Thus, dose increases within the therapeutic dose range may be indicated for antidepressants such as certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvoxamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a>) and tricyclics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipramine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a>). </p><p>In addition to monitoring symptoms (see <a href=\"#H3663642665\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring symptoms'</a> above) to guide dosing, clinicians should monitor serum drug concentrations for certain medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipramine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a>) with established therapeutic ranges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-pregnant-women-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

However, it is reasonable to use a serum level obtained prior to pregnancy during a period of euthymia as a target level during pregnancy. In addition, therapeutic reference ranges for SSRIs have been suggested by practice guidelines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects#H14789327\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;, section on 'Medical tests and plasma levels'</a>.) &#160; </p><p>Antidepressants that are prescribed during the third trimester are generally maintained through delivery; following delivery, we continue to use the same dose that was prescribed before delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-pregnant-women-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/35,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37</a>]. There is no evidence that tapering or discontinuing antidepressants at term reduces the risk of neonatal complications, and tapering or stopping antidepressants can increase the maternal risk of perinatal relapse. It is generally agreed the risks of postnatal depression (especially recurrent episodes) exceed the risks of neonatal complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-major-depression-in-pregnant-women-general-principles-of-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-unipolar-major-depression-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis#H5075538\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum unipolar major depression: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Adverse consequences'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infants-with-antenatal-exposure-to-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris-and-serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris#H90522785\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infants with antenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)&quot;, section on 'Neonatal effects'</a>.)</p><p>Some health care systems obtain a high resolution ultrasound in all pregnant patients at approximately week 18 of the pregnancy. For pregnant patients who are treated with antidepressants in health care systems that do not routinely monitor patients with ultrasounds, this should be discussed with the obstetrician. We recommend an ultrasound if the patient has a personal or family history of cardiac disease, or is receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a>. Echocardiography is also obtained if there is any suspicion of fetal cardiac disease or when paroxetine is used.
