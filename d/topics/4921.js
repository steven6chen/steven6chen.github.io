Losing too much water is a problem, because the body needs a certain amount of water to work normally. Another word doctors sometimes use is &quot;hypovolemia.&quot;</p><p>Dehydration can be mild or severe. Mild dehydration doesn't usually cause problems. But if mild dehydration isn't treated, it can get worse. Severe dehydration is a medical emergency and can be life-threatening.</p><p>Children are at higher risk for dehydration than adults. There are a few reasons for this:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Their bodies are smaller</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are more likely to get viruses that cause vomiting and diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Babies and young children depend on adults to give them liquids, and might not be able to tell someone if they are thirsty.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11005474\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes dehydration?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dehydration happens when your body loses more water than you take in from drinking and eating.</p><p>It's normal for people to lose some water from their bodies every day, for example, in their urine and bowel movements. But some things make people lose a lot of water. In children, this can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems or medicines that cause a person to urinate more than usual</p><p/><p>Some things keep people from taking in enough water. For example, children might not drink or eat if they have an upset stomach or sore throat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11005489\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of dehydration?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with mild dehydration might not notice any symptoms.</p><p>As dehydration gets worse, it can cause symptoms such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling thirsty</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinating less often, or having dark yellow or brown urine</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A dry mouth or cracked lips</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No tears when the child cries</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired or confused</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling dizzy or light-headed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eyes that look sunken in the face</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;sunken fontanel&quot; in babies &ndash; A fontanel is a gap between the bones in a baby's skull. When babies are dehydrated, the fontanel on the top of their head can look or feel caved in.</p><p/><p>Severe dehydration can make people stop breathing normally or go into a coma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11005504\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call the doctor or nurse if your child has any symptoms of dehydration.</p><p>You should also call if your child:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has diarrhea that lasts more than a few days</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has vomiting that lasts more than 1 day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can't keep any fluids down</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomits blood or has bloody diarrhea</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hasn't had anything to drink in many hours</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hasn't needed to urinate in the past 6 to 8 hours (in older children), or hasn't had a wet diaper for 4 to 6 hours (in babies and younger children)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11005519\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for dehydration?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Doctors can do blood and urine tests to check for dehydration and see how severe it is. Your child's doctor might also do tests to look for the cause of the dehydration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11005536\"><span class=\"h1\">How is dehydration treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dehydration is treated with fluids.</p><p>Children with severe dehydration usually need to be treated in the hospital. Treatment might involve getting fluids through an &quot;IV,&quot; which is a thin tube that goes into the vein, or getting small sips of a special fluid designed for children with dehydration.</p><p>If your child only has mild dehydration, you can also treat it by giving them fluids to drink. You'll know that the treatment is working when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child urinates more often and the urine looks pale yellow or clear.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your baby has more wet diapers.</p><p/><p>Some fluids help treat dehydration better than water, because they give the body the right amount of water and salts. You should use the following fluids to treat your child's dehydration:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oral rehydration solutions</a> &ndash; These are special drinks meant to help with dehydration, such as Pedialyte. You can buy them in a store or pharmacy. Try to give your child a few teaspoons of fluid every few minutes. If your baby won't drink it from a bottle or cup, you can feed him or her with a spoon or syringe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast milk &ndash; Babies who breastfeed should continue to breastfeed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apple juice mixed with an equal amount of water</p><p/><p>The child can return to their normal diet once they are no longer dehydrated. Keep giving extra fluids if your child's vomiting or diarrhea continues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11005551\"><span class=\"h1\">Can dehydration be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To help prevent dehydration, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure your child drinks plenty of fluids, especially if he or she is sick and has a fever.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give your baby or young child an oral rehydration solution as soon as he or she starts vomiting or having diarrhea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give your child extra fluids when it's hot out, or if he or she is exercising.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11005566\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=viral-gastroenteritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Viral gastroenteritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heat-stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heat stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotavirus-infection-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rotavirus infection (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-diarrhea-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acute diarrhea in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-in-infants-and-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting in infants and children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
