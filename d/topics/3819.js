As mentioned above, infants and young children may be unable to articulate the source of their discomfort and are more likely to present with irritability. (See <a href=\"#H530842128\" class=\"local\">'Age of the patient'</a> above.)</p><p>Headaches associated with CNS tumors generally are thought to be due to increased ICP. These headaches are classically described as an early morning headache that is often relieved by vomiting. However, many children do not present with these classic symptoms. This was illustrated in a case series of 200 children with CNS tumors that recorded the pattern of headaches in 71 of 112 patients who presented with headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Headaches were nocturnal or occurred in the early morning in 43 patients, occurred during the daytime or early evening in 15, and were continuous in the remaining 13.</p><p>Headaches may be either focal or diffuse. A misdiagnosis of migraine or tension headaches is sometimes made prior to detecting the CNS tumor. However, the presence of other CNS manifestations with the headache can differentiate headaches associated with increased ICP from other causes. In the case series described above, all patients with headaches had one or more other symptom suggestive of a brain tumor (eg, vomiting, vision impairment, unsteady gait, changes in behavior or school performance, sleep disturbances, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> growth impairment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Children with persistent headaches should be assessed by a thorough history and physical examination for any signs and symptoms suggestive of CNS tumors. A child with a history of headaches accompanied by other signs of increased ICP or localizing neurologic symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67480\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67480 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51623\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51623 \">table 2</a>) should be further evaluated by neuroimaging.

Posterior fossa tumors are particularly likely to cause nausea and vomiting.</p><p>Because nausea and vomiting are nonspecific symptoms, children who present with isolated nausea and vomiting may have a prolonged symptom interval prior to diagnosis of the CNS tumor. It is therefore important for clinicians to have a high index of suspicion for brain tumor when evaluating children with recurrent or persistent nausea and vomiting. Often it is the development of additional signs and symptoms (eg, unsteady gait, headaches, cranial nerve palsies) that alerts the clinician to the possibility of a brain tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a retrospective study of 21 infants and young children (&lt;3 years of age) diagnosed with brain tumors at a single institution, three of the children (14 percent) presented with vomiting and underwent initial evaluation with abdominal imaging where working diagnoses were pyloric stenosis, viral gastritis, or gastrointestinal reflux and were later found to have large and aggressive brain tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530843030\"><span class=\"h3\">Ataxia and gait abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ataxia and difficulty with coordination are frequently present in children with posterior fossa lesions. Initial cerebellar dysfunction may be insidious with clumsiness, worsening handwriting, changes in speech, or difficulty in motor skills, such as running or hopping. Abnormal gait is also a common presenting sign in patients with spinal cord tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with acute ataxia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530843036\"><span class=\"h3\">Cranial nerve palsies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cranial neuropathies, such as diplopia, inability to adduct the eye during attempted lateral gaze, facial palsy, drooling, and difficulties with swallowing suggest underlying brainstem pathology.

Chiasmatic tumors often present with a complex visual field loss and decrement in visual acuity. Lesions that are located more posteriorly in the optic tract demonstrate some degree of hemianopsia.

CT is the preferred initial study in an emergent situation with a medically unstable child in whom elevated ICP is suspected. However, it is important to note that a normal CT study does not completely exclude the possibility of a brain lesion.</p><p>MRI imaging is the modality of choice with a child suspected to have a primary spinal tumor. MRI of the spine is also performed in staging brain tumors that have a predilection for leptomeningeal spread. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'MRI imaging'</a> below.)</p><p>The following discussion is a summary of the different neuroimaging modalities used in the diagnosis of CNS tumors. A more in-depth discussion on neuroimaging in the diagnosis of brain tumors is found separately.

Compared with CT, it provides more detailed images of parenchymal lesions, and is more sensitive in detecting lesions within the posterior fossa, subarachnoid spaces, and leptomeninges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78521\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78521 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75202\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75202 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65346\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65346 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55787\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55787 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53610\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53610 \">image 5</a>).</p><p>Gadolinium-enhanced MRI can also provide information that may indicate a specific tumor type. It is the imaging modality of choice for a child with a suspected spinal cord lesion because it is less invasive than CT myelogram and provides superior imaging of soft tissue structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. If a spinal cord tumor is suspected, rapid imaging is critical for detection of the lesion prior to spinal cord compression, which may result in permanent neurologic damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children/abstract/18,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,22-25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-cervical-radiculopathy#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy&quot;, section on 'Imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p>MRI is also used to stage tumors that have a predilection for leptomeningeal spread. In children, these tumors include medulloblastomas, primitive neuroectodermal tumors, atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors, ependymomas, germinomas, and high grade astrocytomas. MRI of the spine should be obtained prior to lumbar puncture or surgical intervention for optimal staging, in order to avoid confusion resulting from procedural artifact or blood. If preoperative imaging is not possible, the staging MRI of the spine should be obtained at least 14 days after surgery in order to minimize any changes that are related to the surgical procedure.</p><p>MR spectroscopy, a supplementation to traditional MRI, can differentiate locally infiltrative brain tumors from other intracranial lesions by detecting the presence of specific metabolic signals (eg, N-acetylaspartate, choline, and lactate) that are present in brain tumor tissue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-brain-tumors-in-adults#H355161935\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical features and diagnosis of brain tumors in adults&quot;, section on 'Role of MR spectroscopy and other imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h4\">Positron emission tomography scans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Positron emission tomography (PET) scans are not routinely used at all centers as part of standard workup for brain tumors, but they can provide useful information to supplement those from MRI scans. PET scans utilize a positron-emitting radionuclide isotope coupled with a sugar (eg, fluorodeoxyglucose) to differentiate malignant lesions with a high metabolic rate from more benign lesions and surrounding tissue with a lower metabolic rate.</p><p>PET scan is useful in determining the areas of maximum glucose utilization within the tumor, which can guide the neurosurgeon to biopsy the location within the tumor with the most aggressive behavior. It is also used to differentiate recurrent tumor from changes due to radiotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children in whom neuroimaging confirms the presence of a mass should be referred to a pediatric neurosurgeon for further evaluation. The next diagnostic step is to obtain tissue to establish the histologic diagnosis, and whenever possible, reduce the tumor burden for most CNS tumors. Post-surgical therapy, which may include radiation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy, is dependent upon the histological diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of central nervous system tumors in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic pitfalls</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since many of the signs and symptoms of childhood CNS tumors are nonspecific and heterogeneous, CNS tumors can be misdiagnosed as common childhood conditions (eg, viral gastroenteritis, tension and migraine headaches). Less common neurological conditions that may mimic the presentation of a brain tumor include brain abscesses, intracranial hemorrhage, non-neoplastic hydrocephalus, arteriovenous malformations, aneurysms, or indolent viral infections.</p><p>Children with CNS tumors generally present with more than one tumor-associated symptom or sign, which allows CNS tumors to be distinguished clinically from other conditions. For example, as discussed above, children with headaches associated with CNS tumors typically have other CNS manifestations, including vomiting, vision impairment, unsteady gait, changes in behavior or school performance, sleep disturbances, and growth impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-central-nervous-system-tumors-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, neuroimaging is needed to definitely differentiate CNS tumors from other diagnoses, and should be performed in any child suspected of having a CNS lesion.
