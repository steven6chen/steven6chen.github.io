This condition is typically the end result of a variety of pathophysiologic processes that render the bronchial walls weakened, easily collapsible, chronically inflamed, and plugged with mucus secretions. Associated findings include atelectasis, emphysema, fibrosis, and hypertrophy of the bronchial vasculature.</p><p>In resource-rich countries, cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common cause of bronchiectasis in children. The management of CF-related bronchiectasis is discussed in detail in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of the treatment of lung disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-antibiotic-therapy-for-chronic-pulmonary-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Antibiotic therapy for chronic pulmonary infection&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Bronchiectasis can be caused by a variety of disease processes other than CF, most of which include some combination of bronchial obstruction and infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F87712\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87712 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>This topic review will describe the management of non-CF-related bronchiectasis in children. The causes, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of non-CF-related bronchiectasis in children, and the treatment of bronchiectasis in adults are discussed elsewhere.

This approach has some limitations because the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis and pathogens seen in these populations can differ. Thus, optimal management depends upon the underlying cause of bronchiectasis and on individual patient characteristics, such as sputum cultures and the response to initial therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of the treatment of lung disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of bronchiectasis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Management approaches include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airway clearance </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mucolytic agents and airway hydration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bronchodilators</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiinflammatory drugs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunization</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotics are typically used to treat acute exacerbations and are sometimes used as long-term therapy in select groups of patients with frequent exacerbations or progressive worsening of lung function. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H446347694\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute exacerbations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute exacerbations of non-CF bronchiectasis are associated with decline in pulmonary function. As an example, in a pediatric study, the frequency of hospitalized exacerbations was found be a significant predictor of FEV1 decline, with FEV1 percent predicted decreasing by 1.95 percent with each hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchiectasis-in-children-without-cystic-fibrosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Defining an acute exacerbation in non-CF related bronchiectasis is not well-established. However, as in patients with CF, exacerbations are typically diagnosed based on clinical symptoms, which include increased cough, change in sputum color, and consistency, and less commonly chest pain, dyspnea, or hemoptysis, in addition to constitutional symptoms of fatigue, loss of appetite, and fever (which is not always present). Objective measures including decline in lung function in older children and new radiological findings also may aid in the diagnosis. One study in found that wet cough and cough severity over 72 hours were the best predictors of an exacerbation, while sputum color, chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and chest signs also were significant predictors, and were considered as minor criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchiectasis-in-children-without-cystic-fibrosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Inclusion of serum C-reactive protein, amyloid-A, and interleukin 6 improved its specificity and positive predictive value (PPV). </p><p>Treatment of acute respiratory exacerbations in patients with non-CF-related bronchiectasis is similar to the approach used for patients with CF. The choice of antibiotics is usually based upon sputum culture results; in young children who are unable to produce sputum, cultures can be obtained from a throat swab inserted deeply into the posterior pharynx to induce a cough. In the absence of culture results, it is reasonable to select antibiotics to cover the most common organisms, including <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, and <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em> (such as amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, or a second- or third-generation cephalosporin). One study in children with newly diagnosed non-CF-related bronchiectasis in Australia suggests that <em>H. influenzae</em> is a common causative organism: at the time of diagnosis, <em>H. influenzae</em> was detected in 47 percent of specimens obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), while <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> was found in just 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchiectasis-in-children-without-cystic-fibrosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Most experts suggest antibiotic treatment of all significant exacerbations, including those with a suspected or established viral trigger because the relative contributions and interactions of viral and bacterial infections have not been established. </p><p>Emerging evidence suggests a role for viral infections in exacerbations of non-CF-related bronchiectasis. In a study of 69 children with non-CF-related bronchiectasis, at least one respiratory virus was detected in 48 percent of exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchiectasis-in-children-without-cystic-fibrosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The most commonly detected viruses were rhinovirus (26 percent) and parainfluenza (8 percent). Virus-positive exacerbations were more likely to be associated coryzal symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fever, hypoxemia, findings on chest exam such as crackles and wheezing, and hospitalization. These findings suggest that viral infections are common and likely contribute to the pathogenesis of a significant proportion of exacerbations; however, the role of viral-bacterial interactions remains unclear. Until further information is available, these findings do not change the more recent recommendations for antibiotic therapy.</p><p>For outpatient treatment of acute exacerbations, most patients are given oral antibiotics for 10 to 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchiectasis-in-children-without-cystic-fibrosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Intravenous antibiotics are reserved for severe exacerbations or exacerbations responding poorly to outpatient therapy. Antibiotics are typically selected based upon sputum culture microorganism growth and sensitivities &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H446347673\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential benefits of chronic antibiotics in this population must be balanced against the risk of developing antibiotic resistance. There is little clinical evidence to guide these decisions in the pediatric population. A systematic review of 18 trials including adults and children with non-CF related bronchiectasis found a statistically significant reduction in exacerbations and a non-significant reduction in hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchiectasis-in-children-without-cystic-fibrosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, the risk of emerging drug resistance was more than threefold versus control subjects. The evidence was considered to be low and moderate quality and was based primarily on studies in adults.</p><p>In view of the above considerations, we suggest using chronic antibiotics only in selected patients with non-CF related bronchiectasis. The following suggestions reflect our own practice and are primarily extrapolated from clinical evidence in patients with CF: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients without <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> infection, we use chronic antibiotics for those with frequent acute exacerbations (eg, three or more exacerbations annually) or those with progressive deterioration of lung function. The antibiotic is tailored to sputum cultures and sensitivities rather than chosen empirically. A regimen might include cycles of two weeks of antibiotics, alternating with two weeks without antibiotics, with clinical reevaluation to assess whether the treatment has been beneficial, including trials of stopping therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with persistent <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infection, we suggest using chronic inhaled antipseudomonal antibiotics (typically aminoglycosides). We also suggest a trial of an eradication protocol in children with newly acquired <em>P. aeruginosa</em>. This clinical approach is extrapolated from experience in children with CF-related bronchiectasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-antibiotic-therapy-for-chronic-pulmonary-infection#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Antibiotic therapy for chronic pulmonary infection&quot;, section on 'Inhaled tobramycin'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-antibiotic-therapy-for-chronic-pulmonary-infection#H2457284300\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Antibiotic therapy for chronic pulmonary infection&quot;, section on 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Studies in adults with non-CF related bronchiectasis also support this approach. As an example, a systemic review and meta-analysis in adult patients, most with chronic <em>P. aeruginosa</em> infection, suggests that inhaled antibiotics (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=colistin-colistimethate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">colistin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tobramycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ciprofloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amikacin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">gentamicin</a>) may reduce sputum bacterial load, help to eradicate bacteria from sputum, and prevent acute exacerbations, with an acceptable safety profile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchiectasis-in-children-without-cystic-fibrosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway clearance therapies are routinely performed to improve mucociliary clearance. This is common practice for individuals with bronchiectasis with or without CF, although it is based on very limited data. A systematic review of seven trials including 105 patients with non-CF-related bronchiectasis concluded that airway clearance techniques appear to be safe for adults and children with stable bronchiectasis and may lead to improvements in sputum expectoration, selected measures of lung function, patient symptoms, and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchiectasis-in-children-without-cystic-fibrosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>A variety of techniques are used, including postural drainage and percussion, breathing and coughing techniques, airway oscillating devices, external percussion vests, and intrapulmonary percussive ventilation. Based upon studies in patients with CF, none of these techniques appears superior to others, although there are differences in convenience, patient adherence to the regimen, and cost.

A randomized study in adults of inhaled mannitol (400 mg given twice daily for 12 months) showed no insignificant effect on reducing exacerbations or improving quality of life but it was safe and well-tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchiectasis-in-children-without-cystic-fibrosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Similarly, a 12-month randomized study of hypertonic saline in adults showed no difference in lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchiectasis-in-children-without-cystic-fibrosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchodilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchodilator treatment may be appropriate in some children with bronchiectasis, but has not been studied rigorously.

Also, in a randomized trial in 89 children with non-CF-related bronchiectasis in Australia and New Zealand, azithromycin given once weekly for up to two years resulted in a 50 percent reduction in exacerbations and improved weight gain.

Prediction of outcomes is limited by lack of prospective longitudinal studies in this population. However, retrospective studies suggest that with early diagnosis and appropriate therapy, lung function in children can stabilize or improve over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchiectasis-in-children-without-cystic-fibrosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>For children with post-infectious non-CF related bronchiectasis who are treated appropriately, the disease typically progresses much more slowly than CF-related bronchiectasis, and often improves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchiectasis-in-children-without-cystic-fibrosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

This condition is the end result of a variety of pathophysiologic processes, usually a combination of infection and impaired airway drainage or obstruction. Important causes of bronchiectasis in children include cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic aspiration, infection (with or without underlying immunodeficiency), foreign body aspiration, and congenital pulmonary defects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F87712\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87712 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-bronchiectasis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of bronchiectasis in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management strategies for bronchiectasis in children depend on the underlying cause of bronchiectasis and individual patient characteristics. These approaches are similar to those used for adult patients with bronchiectasis. (See <a href=\"#H3993967242\" class=\"local\">'Medical therapies'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-bronchiectasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of bronchiectasis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most pediatric patients with non-CF-related bronchiectasis, we suggest systemic antibiotics to treat acute exacerbations (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We also suggest routine chest physiotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Airway clearance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those with persistent Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, we suggest chronic treatment with inhaled aminoglycosides (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with frequent acute exacerbations or progressive deterioration of lung function, we suggest treatment with long-term antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The antibiotics are tailored to sputum cultures and sensitivities, rather than chosen empirically, and the patient is reevaluated periodically. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic treatment with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">azithromycin</a> may be considered for children older than six years of age who have frequent exacerbations or progressive decline in pulmonary function. Because most of the evidence for benefit is indirect and there is an associated risk of antibiotic resistance, careful consideration and judgment is needed when making individual treatment decisions. We do not suggest chronic treatment with high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ibuprofen</a> or glucocorticoids, due to insufficient evidence. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Antiinflammatory drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children with non-CF-related bronchiectasis we suggest NOT treating with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dornase-alfa-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">DNase</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Although DNase is recommended for children with CF, it is not effective in adults with non-CF-related bronchiectasis, and may even be harmful. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Mucolytic agents and airway hydration'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchiectasis-in-children-without-cystic-fibrosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Kapur N, Masters IB, Chang AB.
