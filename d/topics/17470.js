Since then, its utility in the diagnosis of endobronchial, peripheral, and mediastinal lesions has been reported in research publications and confirmed with widespread clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/7-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-14</a>].</p><p>TBNA provides an opportunity to diagnose and stage pulmonary and mediastinal lesions (particularly lung cancer) in a minimally invasive fashion, even in the absence of endobronchial disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Despite such advantages, TBNA is underutilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>], a trend that may change since trainees are increasingly gaining experience with the technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>The role of TBNA in the diagnosis of mediastinal, central and peripheral lesions is reviewed here. In addition, anatomic and technical considerations are discussed. The staging of non-small cell lung cancer is presented separately.

It is used to obtain cellular or core biopsy tissue from lung lesions that are accessible by bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy is used to direct the operator to the target lesion (eg, lung mass or lymph node). The needle is then passed through the working channel of the bronchoscope, through the bronchial wall and material is aspirated for histological analysis. It can be performed as a blind procedure during conventional white light bronchoscopy (bronchoscopic-TBNA) or under image-guidance using a bronchoscope with endobronchial ultrasound or electromagnetic navigational capability (EBUS-TBNA; EMN-TBNA).</p><p>Details of the technique and the indications for bronchoscopy and EBUS are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endobronchial-ultrasound-indications-contraindications-and-complications#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endobronchial ultrasound: Indications, contraindications, and complications&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications#H288135465\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Indications and contraindications&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a> and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57818 \">table 1</a>). The most common application of TBNA is the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer. However, TBNA can also be used to sample benign or malignant endobronchial, submucosal, peribronchial (when extrinsic compression exists), or peripheral lesions. TBNA may be the only diagnostic modality that can be performed in patients in whom mediastinoscopy is contraindicated due to a bleeding diathesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/15,16,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are numerous factors that influence the diagnostic yield of transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA). They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Likelihood of malignancy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location (eg, airway lesion, anterior mediastinal lymph node), size (bulky), and appearance (eg, spiculated masses) of the lesion or lymph node, as determined by computed tomography (CT)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visibility and carinal involvement of the tumor, as determined by bronchoscopy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Image guidance, in particular endobronchial ultrasound</p><p/><p>In addition, technical issues can influence diagnostic yield, including operator experience, the type of needle, the number of attempts, the number of aspirates, and the presence of an on-site cytologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/23-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-35</a>]. </p><p>Essentials of the TBNA procedure (the &quot;six T's&quot;), computed tomography, type of needle, technique, tissue preparation, tissue interpretation, and trained assistant, should be considered every time a TBNA is performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51774\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51774 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT is typically performed prior to bronchoscopy and TBNA in order to evaluate the relationship of the tracheobronchial tree to the surrounding structures, including lymph nodes and blood vessels. This maximizes diagnostic yield and safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Virtual bronchoscopy, a CT-based technique that allows the presentation of computer-generated intraluminal images, may be helpful in planning complex procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-overview#H19909537\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Overview&quot;, section on 'Virtual bronchoscopy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location of the lymph nodes &ndash; Aspiration of only five stations (out of 11 that are accessible to TBNA) is useful for staging of lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/36,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,38</a>]. Aspiration of the remainder is undertaken to increase the chances of making a tissue diagnosis, but is not helpful for staging. The most recent International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASCL) lymph node map is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73945\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73945 \">figure 1</a>).<br/><br/>TBNA of lymph nodes in the subcarinal and right paratracheal regions detects metastasis with a higher sensitivity than TBNA of left paratracheal lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In addition, TBNA of mediastinal lymph nodes performed for diagnosis and staging of a tumor in the right lung is more sensitive than that performed for a tumor in the left lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].<br/><br/>The location of the lymph nodes in relation to the tracheobronchial tree is best visualized by imagining the interior of the airway as a clock face, using the carina as the central reference point. The best approach for each station with the bronchoscopist standing behind the patient lying in a supine position is outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59333\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59333 \">table 3</a>). To obtain an adequate specimen, the needle must reach the core of the lymph node while avoiding nearby vascular structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54056%7EPULM%2F73983%7EPULM%2F65244\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54056 graphicRef73983 graphicRef65244 \">figure 2A-C</a>).<br/><br/>Anteriorly and to the right of the distal third of the trachea are found the superior vena cava and the azygos vein. Directly anterior to the trachea, above the level of the primary carina, lie the innominate artery and the aortic arch. They cross the origin of the left mainstem bronchus and then lie anterior and to the left of the distal third of the trachea, making an easily recognizable pulsatile imprint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The main pulmonary artery divides into the right and left branches within the concavity of the aortic arch. The left pulmonary artery runs anterosuperiorly, in close approximation (within 3 to 5 mm) to the left mainstem bronchus, while the right pulmonary artery lies anterior to the right mainstem bronchus and the origin of the upper lobe bronchus. The esophagus lies in close approximation (within 2 to 3 mm) to the posterior wall of the trachea and the left mainstem bronchus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. When TBNA is performed, these areas should be avoided unless a clearly visualized pathologic process is documented by radiographic evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Size of the lesion and lymph nodes &ndash; Mediastinal lymph nodes that appear enlarged on a CT scan (&gt;1 cm) have better diagnostic yield from TBNA than those that do not appear enlarged (&lt;1 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/41,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,43,44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Type of needle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide variety of biopsy needles are available, but we recommend familiarizing oneself and the bronchoscopy suite staff with no more than one or two needles for each indication.</p><p>All needle systems for transbronchial aspiration consist of [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retractable sharp beveled flexible needle</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A flexible catheter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A proximal control device to manipulate the needle, the stylet, or both, and a side port through which suction can be applied</p><p/><p>Only retractable needles should be used, because non-retractable needles may damage the working channel of the bronchoscope. The 20 to 22 gauge (20 to 22 G) needles are usually used to obtain cytology specimens while the larger 19 G needles are needed to obtain a core of tissue for histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. For lesions located outside the airway wall, the needle should be at least 10 mm in length. A needle 15 mm in length and 21 G in diameter is necessary for the aspiration of a mediastinal abscess or cyst.</p><p>The catheter should be flexible enough to maneuver into peripheral locations, yet stiff enough to exert force to penetrate the thick proximal bronchial wall to sample central lesions. Additional rigidity is provided by a metal stylet.</p><p>Histology specimens may be obtained from central lesions using a trocar and cannula design involving 21 G and 19 G beveled, retractable needles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The 21 G, 5 mm long needle (trocar) facilitates insertion of the 19 G, 15 mm long needle (cannula), prevents inadvertent puncture of the major vessels by the latter, and prevents plugging by the tracheobronchial wall cartilage.</p><p>For mediastinal staging of patients with lung cancer, some studies suggest that needle size can affect diagnostic yield while others suggest no impact on this outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/23-27,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27,35</a>]. Some of this difference may relate to operator experience, the needle size used in the study, the type of bronchoscope used for biopsy (conventional versus endobronchial ultrasound), and the presence of experienced cytopathologists in the bronchoscopy suite (ie, rapid on-site evaluation [ROSE]). One prospective study suggested a higher diagnostic yield of 19 G needles compared with 22 G needles (85 versus 53 percent) when conventional white light bronchoscopy was used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In contrast, most other studies suggest that there is no difference in the diagnostic yield with a 21 G or 22 G needle, particularly when endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ROSE are being used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/24-27,35,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27,35,48</a>]. </p><p>Thus, choosing needle size is at the discretion of the operator and depends on the goal of biopsy, pathology, cytopathology, or tissue culture. We typically use a 19 G needle for core biopsy material when large tissue samples are needed to evaluate tissue architecture; a 21 or 22 G needle is typically used when the goal of TBNA is cellular material for cytopathology and tissue culture or when safety is an issue (eg, biopsy of 4L station close to vascular structures). The size of needle typically used to perform TBNA in specific patient populations is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73427\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73427 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TBNA can be performed as a blind procedure during conventional white light bronchoscopy (bronchoscopic-TBNA) or under image-guidance using a bronchoscope with endobronchial ultrasound capability (EBUS-TBNA). </p><p>TBNA can be safely and successfully performed for unexpected endobronchial lesions encountered during routine fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Conventional fluoroscopy is required for sampling peripheral lesions, and CT fluoroscopy can facilitate biopsy of smaller or more inaccessible mediastinal or parenchymal lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>].</p><p>During insertion of the catheter, the flexible bronchoscope should be kept as straight as possible, with its distal tip in the neutral position in order to prevent damage to the working channel by the needle. The beveled end of the needle should be kept within the metal hub during its passage through the working channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].</p><p>The needle should be advanced and locked into place once the metal hub is visible beyond the tip of the fiberoptic bronchoscope. The catheter should be retracted, and the tip of the needle kept distal to that of the fiberoptic bronchoscope. The bronchoscope is then advanced to the target area, and the tip of the needle is anchored in the intercartilaginous space so as to penetrate the airway wall in as perpendicular manner as possible, with a needle to wall angle &gt;45 degrees (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70074\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70074 \">figure 3</a>). Protruding the catheter more than a few millimeters beyond the tip of the bronchoscope may kink it, leading to difficulty in attaining proper needle position, penetration, and aspiration. Using the working channel to splint the distal end of the catheter further facilitates sampling.</p><p>The techniques that may be used to insert the needle through the airway wall are shown in the figure and described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78961%7EPULM%2F69955%7EPULM%2F73571\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78961 graphicRef69955 graphicRef73571 \">figure 4A-C</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74513\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74513 \">table 5</a>). These techniques may be used alone or in combination for successful penetration of the needle through the tracheobronchial wall. The needle should be inserted to its fullest extent with the metal hub flush against the tracheobronchial wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78323\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78323 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p>With the needle inserted, suction is applied at the proximal side port using a 60 mL syringe. Aspiration of blood indicates inadvertent penetration of a major intrathoracic vessel; if this occurs, suction is released, the needle is retracted, and a new site is selected for aspiration. If no blood is aspirated, the catheter is agitated to and fro to obtain cytology specimens and is moved in and out by 3 to 4 millimeters to obtain histology specimens, with continuous suction, in an attempt to shear off cells from the mass or lymph node. The needle is withdrawn from the target site after releasing suction. The tip of the bronchoscope is straightened and the needle assembly removed from the bronchoscope in a single, smooth motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Use of the 19 G needle assembly and a variation of the technique used to obtain cytology specimens allows obtaining histology samples via TBNA. The assembly is passed until only the distal metal hub is seen beyond the tip of the bronchoscope, while taking the same precautions as with the cytology needle. Once the metal hub is visible, the 19 G needle is advanced and locked into place beyond the metal hub (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71049\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71049 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p>The automatically advanced 21 G needle is used to puncture the airway wall and is anchored at the target site by any of the techniques previously described (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71049\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71049 \">figure 6</a>). Using a 60 mL syringe containing 3 mL of normal saline, suction is applied at the proximal port to ascertain the safety of the location.</p><p>This is followed by insertion of the 19 G needle to its fullest extent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71049\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71049 \">figure 6</a>) and withdrawal of the 21 G needle. Under continuous suction, the 19 G needle is moved to and fro 4 to 5 times to obtain a core of tissue. The needle is flushed into the preservative to obtain the specimen, although on occasion the 21 G needle may be required to push the core out of the 19 G needle. Successful sampling is indicated by visualizing a definite core of tissue at the bottom of the preservative container.</p><p>Submucosal lesions may be sampled by incomplete penetration of the airway wall at an acute angle, while applying suction. Sampling of endobronchial lesions may be performed by fully embedding the needle in the lesion, oriented parallel to the airway wall, and agitating to and fro repeatedly, with continuous suction. Sampling of peripheral lesions is best performed under fluoroscopic guidance, placing the metal hub of the needle against the lesion before pushing the needle into the lesion. For more difficult to reach lesions, the needle may be advanced in a major airway and then guided into the lesion under fluoroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>The number of aspirations performed at each target site impacts diagnostic yield. One study found that the diagnostic yield increased incrementally until the seventh aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. A subsequent study reported similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, the latter study also indicated that three passes were sufficient only when alternate sampling sites were available and that four or five passes should be performed at nodal stations critical for staging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper handling of the obtained specimen is a critical and underappreciated aspect of the procedure. The specimen for cytology is prepared by using air from a 60 mL empty syringe to spray the specimen onto the slide, smearing it using another slide, and immediately placing it in a 95 percent alcohol solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Delay of even a few seconds may result in drying artifacts on the cells. The specimen is then flushed from the needle using 3 mL of saline or Hank's solution, and sent to the cytology lab for further processing.</p><p>Specimens are sent for cell block preparation, which provides either cytologic or histologic examination, depending upon the size and integrity of the sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. When core specimens are desired, at least two satisfactory specimens should be obtained at each location, and multiple passes may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ROSE of the specimen by a cytopathologist for sample adequacy has been demonstrated to increase diagnostic yield [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/27,33,34,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,33,34,58</a>]. Some of the criteria that may be used to judge the adequacy of a sample obtained for cytology are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56119\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56119 \">table 6</a>). Specimens containing rare malignant cells rather than clumps of malignant cells should not be classified as malignant and should not be relied upon for definitive diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/59-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-62</a>]. The steps that may be taken to reduce false positive results and avoid overstaging of lung cancer are highlighted in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76425\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76425 \">table 7</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Trained assistant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A trained assistant schooled in the intricacies of TBNA is essential to ensure smooth performance of the procedure and proper tissue handling, which are critical to achieving a high yield [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) are procedure- related (eg, bleeding and pneumothorax) and sedation-related (eg, hypotension, respiratory failure), which are discussed separately.

A coagulation profile is not needed prior to TBNA in the absence of a history of a bleeding diathesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Although a variety of complications related to TBNA have been reported (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57265\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57265 \">table 8</a>), damage to the working channel of the bronchoscope is by far the most important. This complication is more common when nonretractable needles or 19 G needles are used, and great care needs to be taken while manipulating the apparatus through the bronchoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/52,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,64,65</a>]&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F81761\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81761 \">figure 7</a>).</p><p>The incidence of fever and bacteremia has been debated, and no firm recommendations can be made regarding antibiotic prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis&quot;</a>). Transient bacteremia six hours after the procedure with prompt defervescence after antibiotic therapy has been reported. After TBNA of a subcarinal mass, one patient experienced a purulent pericarditis with polymicrobial mouth flora and required pericardiocentesis and catheter drainage in addition to antibiotics to effect a cure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>Marked bleeding has not been reported, even in anticoagulated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>].

The use of radial probe EBUS-TBNA for lesions &lt;3 cm is less sensitive but can be used at the discretion of the practising physician. The biopsy of solitary pulmonary nodules and use of image-guided bronchoscopy techniques for the biopsy of peripheral nodules are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of the incidental pulmonary nodule&quot;, section on 'Nonsurgical biopsy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=image-guided-bronchoscopy-for-biopsy-of-peripheral-pulmonary-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Image-guided bronchoscopy for biopsy of peripheral pulmonary lesions&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common application of transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) is the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer. However, TBNA can also be used to sample mediastinal, hilar, endobronchial, submucosal, peribronchial (when extrinsic compression exists), or peripheral lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57818 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography (CT) is typically performed prior to bronchoscopy and TBNA in order to evaluate the relationship of the tracheobronchial tree to the surrounding structures, including lymph nodes and blood vessels. This maximizes diagnostic yield and safety. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smaller needles (eg, 20 to 22 gauge) are used to obtain cytology specimens, whereas larger needles (eg, 19 gauge) are necessary to obtain a core of tissue for histology. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Type of needle'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proper handling of the specimen is critical. The first specimen is sprayed from the needle onto a microscope slide using air, smeared using another slide, and then placed in 95 percent alcohol solution. Delays can result in drying artifacts. Subsequent specimens are flushed from the needle using saline or Hank's solution. On-site evaluation by a cytopathologist improves diagnostic yield. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Tissue preparation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A coagulation profile is not needed prior to TBNA in the absence of a history of bleeding diathesis. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To perform TBNA, a needle-containing catheter is advanced through the flexible bronchoscope until the metal hub of the catheter is visible. The needle is then advanced from the tip of the catheter and locked into position. Next, the catheter is retracted until only the needle tip is visible. The bronchoscope is then advanced until the tip of the needle is anchored in its target, suction is applied, and the catheter is agitated (if no blood was aspirated). The needle-containing catheter is removed after suction is released. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is superior to conventional bronchoscopic-TBNA and has become the preferred first-step procedure for staging mediastinal lymph nodes of the anterior and superior mediastinum in patients with suspected lung cancer. Its diagnostic sensitivity may be enhanced when multiple passes and rapid onsite evaluation (ROSE) is concurrently used. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Mediastinal lymphadenopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with airway lesions, TBNA has a high diagnostic yield. In contrast, the yield is much lower for parenchymal lesions particularly smaller peripheral lesions. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Airway lesions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Lung nodules or masses'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transbronchial-needle-aspiration/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Schieppati, E.
