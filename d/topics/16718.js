Diagnosis can be difficult and clinicians should consider the possibility of syndesmotic injury in athletes with pain or injury around the ankle or lower leg. Treatment too is different from typical ankle sprains and surgery may be necessary, making recognition important for optimal recovery.</p><p>The risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of high ankle sprains in the absence of any associated fracture is reviewed here. The common ankle sprain and other ankle-related injuries are discussed separately.

Using clinical diagnostic criteria (ie, not radiologic), the largest observational studies report that high ankle sprains comprise approximately 6 percent of acute ankle sprains without fracture. The incidence in the United States is 2.09 injuries per 100,000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In the general population presenting to an emergency department, 5.7 percent of acute ankle sprains without fracture are high ankle sprains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. At the United States Military Academy, 6.7 percent of acute ankle injuries involve the syndesmosis, with an incidence rate of 4.8 per 1000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A smaller study at the Academy found 16 percent of acute ankle sprains involve the syndesmosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The incidence reported in other subpopulations varies widely. High ankle sprains comprised 4 percent of all acute ankle sprains among professional English soccer players [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], 24.6 percent among American college football players [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and 73 percent among professional American hockey players [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Other studies confirm the relatively high rates among American football players and participants in other contact sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The high, rigid ankle support of a hockey skate, which transfers forces proximally along the leg, likely plays a role in the higher rate of syndesmotic injury among hockey players, although the actual incidence is unlikely to be as high as that reported in the study cited above.</p><p>Among studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate injury patterns, prospective studies of acute ankle injuries without fracture presenting to emergency departments reported syndesmotic injuries in 8 to 13 percent of injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In other subpopulations, the proportion of acute ankle injuries with syndesmotic injury varies from 20 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. This wide range is likely due to inconsistencies in the literature related to the different subpopulations studied. As examples, some studies have looked only at winter athletes while others include only patients with &quot;severe&quot; ankle sprains. </p><p>Risk factors for high ankle sprain in athletes include male sex (threefold risk) and intercollegiate (ie, high level) sport participation (2.4-fold risk) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Of major sports, American football, lacrosse, and soccer are most commonly involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Game play conferred a 14-fold risk compared with practice among American college football players, among whom 75 percent of injuries involved contact with another player [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Incidence was also significantly higher in athletes playing on artificial turf in this study. Winter sports involving use of skis and skates may increase risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12</a>], presumably due to the high-energy external rotation forces exerted on the lower leg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36233267\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ANATOMY AND BIOMECHANICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bony ankle joint is comprised of the tibia and fibula articulating with the talus. Together the tibia and fibula comprise the ceiling, or &quot;plafond,&quot; of the ankle joint. Approximately 85 percent of body weight is supported by the tibia and the remainder by the fibula. Ligamentous stability is provided proximally by the ligaments comprising the tibiofibular syndesmosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77999\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77999 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F101967\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101967 \">picture 1</a>); laterally by the anterior talofibular ligament, calcaneofibular ligament (CFL), and posterior talofibular ligament (PTFL) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78924\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78924 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72462\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72462 \">figure 3</a>); medially by the broad deltoid ligament (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61079\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61079 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51952 \">figure 5</a>); and circumferentially by the joint capsule. Ankle anatomy is reviewed in greater detail separately; the tibiofibular syndesmosis and other structures of direct relevance to high ankle sprains are discussed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ankle-fractures-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ankle fractures in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical anatomy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-achilles-ankle-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-Achilles ankle tendinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A syndesmosis is defined as a fibrous joint formed by two adjacent bones linked by strong membranes or ligaments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101843\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101843 \">figure 6</a>). The distal lateral tibia has a concavity of varying depth&mdash;the incisura tibialis&mdash;that houses the convex distal medial fibula. The tibiofibular contact zone is 3 to 9 mm long and 2 to 5 mm wide, and each surface is covered with thin hyaline cartilage continuous with that of the plafond. The tibiofibular syndesmosis is comprised of four ligamentous structures: the anterior tibiofibular ligament (ATiFL), the posterior tibiofibular ligament (PTiFL), the transverse ligament, and the interosseous membrane (IOM).</p><p>The wide, trapezoid-shaped ATiFL is located immediately superior to the anterior mortise and traverses obliquely in a posteroinferior orientation from the tibia to the fibula. Approximately 20 percent of the inferior edge of the ligament is intraarticular. The similarly shaped PTiFL is located immediately superior to the posterior mortise and traverses obliquely anteroinferiorly from the tibia to the fibula. Its lower part, the transverse ligament, is considered a separate structure and is a round, thick ligament that runs more horizontally from tibia to fibula. The IOM is of variable size and can be absent in some persons. It spans from tibia to fibula along a 2-cm length, lying between the ATiFL and PTiFL and blending into both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The syndesmosis provides proximal stability to the ankle joint. It is strong but not completely rigid and normally has a small degree of motion. The IOM is more elastic and may act as a &quot;spring&quot; giving the syndesmosis slight flexibility during the late-stance phase of walking when the foot is dorsiflexed, bringing the widest part of the talus into the ankle mortise. The other ligaments provide more rigid stability at the endpoints of this movement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The ATiFL provides approximately 35 percent of this stability, 33 percent is provided by the transverse ligament, 22 percent by the IOM, and 9 percent by the PTiFL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. When the ankle is fully dorsiflexed, the syndesmosis is placed in tension, and when external rotation is added to this, these ligaments are placed at greater risk of rupture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36233273\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High ankle sprains typically occur during high-intensity athletic activities such as competitive American football, soccer (football), lacrosse, hockey, and other contact or collision sports, and downhill skiing. An external rotation force applied to a dorsiflexed ankle is the most common mechanism. This can happen when the leg is rotated forcefully against a planted foot or toe. Most such injuries occur during contact with other athletes either when the athlete is standing and the foot is forced into dorsiflexion and external rotation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F101955\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101955 \">figure 7</a>), or when the athlete is prone on the ground and another athlete steps or lands on their posterior leg while the foot is externally rotated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Noncontact injury accounted for approximately 25 percent of syndesmotic sprains among American college athletes over five seasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Other possible mechanisms may include abduction (lateral shift) or eversion (lateral tilt) of the foot, or hyper-dorsiflexion at the ankle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>In all mechanisms, the lateral force of the talus pressed against the distal fibula applies tension across the syndesmosis. This tension causes a sequence of injuries depending upon the degree of force involved. Rupture of the anterior tibiofibular ligament (ATiFL) is the first injury, followed by a tear of the interosseous membrane (IOM), and, rarely, the posterior tibiofibular ligament (PTiFL). If the force causing the injury is sufficiently great, there may also be disruption of the deltoid ligament medially, a spiral fracture of the proximal fibula (Maisonneuve fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F80672\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80672 \">image 1</a>)), or both. In cadaver studies where the syndesmotic ligaments are sectioned and the foot placed in various positions of stress, isolated ATiFL rupture resulted in the fibula externally rotating and sometimes displacing posteriorly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, weight-bearing did not increase the degree of displacement in these studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36233279\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND EXAMINATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26135173\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient with a high ankle sprain typically describes a clear injury to the ankle. Some may recall a mechanism involving forceful external rotation of a dorsiflexed ankle, as described immediately above. Pain is usually focused along the anterolateral ankle, but may be more diffuse and severe if medial ligaments are disrupted. Athletes with milder injuries may be able to continue playing through the pain, but often with reduced speed and agility. Those with more severe injuries are usually unable to continue sport activity due to severe pain with any weight bearing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26135179\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On examination, common findings in patients with a high ankle sprain include antalgic gait or inability to bear weight, lateral and possibly anterior ankle edema, as well as tenderness over the anterior tibiofibular ligament (ATiFL) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66111\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66111 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F102840\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102840 \">picture 3</a>) and possibly more proximally along the interosseous membrane (IOM). According to a small prospective study using MRI as the gold standard, local tenderness over the syndesmosis ligaments had a sensitivity of 92 percent and specificity of 29 percent for syndesmotic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Medial and lateral ankle ligaments may be tender depending on the extent of injury.</p><p>Bony tenderness may indicate fracture. At a minimum, bony palpation should include the proximal fibula, distal tibia and fibula, and talus. In patients with severe pain and disability, it is reasonable to obtain plain radiographs to assess for fracture prior to performing any further examination maneuvers.</p><p>To the extent possible based on the patient's symptoms and injuries, ankle range of motion and strength should be assessed in all planes of ankle motion (dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, inversion, and eversion). Stability testing should include tests of the lateral ankle ligaments, including the drawer test for the anterior talofibular ligament (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58891\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58891 \">picture 4</a>) and the talar tilt test for the calcaneofibular ligament (CFL) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51938\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51938 \">picture 5</a>). Neurovascular status should be assessed to determine the presence of complications and associated conditions.</p><p>Tests of the syndesmosis include the single-leg hop, squeeze, dorsiflexion-external rotation, Cotton, and fibular translation tests. A systematic review of clinical tests for ankle syndesmosis injury found that clinicians cannot rely on any single diagnostic maneuver to definitively diagnose syndesmosis injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, a prospective, blinded study of 87 patients with acute syndesmosis injury confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that a combination of sensitive signs (tenderness over the ATiFL, inability to perform a single-leg hop, and a painful dorsiflexion-external rotation test) plus one specific sign (painful squeeze test) resulted in a high degree of diagnostic accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. We believe that performing this combination of four tests is a sensible approach to the examination when syndesmotic injury is a major consideration. However, if this approach is unrevealing but clinical suspicion remains high, it is best to perform diagnostic imaging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26135185\"><span class=\"h2\">Special tests</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36233285\"><span class=\"h3\">Dorsiflexion-external rotation test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dorsiflexion-external rotation test reproduces pain at the syndesmosis by recreating the forces involved in a common mechanism of injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F107748\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107748 \">picture 6</a>). It is performed with the patient seated and the leg hanging off the examination table at a 90-degree angle. The leg is stabilized by grasping the upper calf or front of the knee with one hand. The other hand grasps the foot, dorsiflexes the ankle to its endpoint, and then gently but firmly externally rotates the foot. During foot rotation the knee should remain facing forward. Pain reproduced at the ATiFL location is considered a positive test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/16,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20,21</a>]. In isolation, this maneuver showed a sensitivity of 71 percent and specificity of 63 percent in a prospective study of 87 patients of whom 38 had a syndesmotic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It is best used in conjunction with another sign with high sensitivity, such as localized tenderness over the ATiFL, to &quot;rule out&quot; a syndesmosis injury if the test is negative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36233291\"><span class=\"h3\">Squeeze test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The squeeze test attempts to reproduce pain at the syndesmosis. It is performed with the patient seated and the leg hanging off the examination table at a 90-degree angle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F102841\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102841 \">picture 7</a>). The examiner squeezes the upper half of the calf in an anteromedial-to-posterolateral direction. Biomechanically, this maneuver causes widening of the distal tibiofibular space. Pain reproduced at the ATiFL location is considered a positive test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/17,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,22</a>]. In isolation, this test showed a sensitivity of 26 percent and specificity of 88 percent in a prospective study of 87 patients of whom 38 had a syndesmotic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Given its high specificity, it is best used to &quot;rule in&quot; a syndesmosis injury after other signs with higher sensitivity are found to be positive. </p><p>Other tests include fibular translation and talar translation maneuvers. However, these examination tests have not been rigorously tested for sensitivity, specificity, or clinical accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] and have poor interrater reliability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and therefore are not recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36233309\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36233316\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to diagnostic imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard plain radiographs of the ankle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F86799\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86799 \">image 2</a>) are recommended for the evaluation of suspected high ankle sprains due to the association of this injury with joint instability. In acute ankle injury, the Ottawa criteria should be used to determine who warrants evaluation with radiographs. However, regardless of these criteria, if the dorsiflexion-external rotation test is performed prior to imaging and elicits pain, indicating possible syndesmotic injury, plain radiographs should be obtained because a positive test is associated with ankle fracture and diastasis may be apparent on radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Guidance about the views to obtain and how to assess them is provided below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ankle-sprain#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ankle sprain&quot;, section on 'Ottawa ankle rules'</a> and <a href=\"#H36233322\" class=\"local\">'Plain radiographs'</a> below and <a href=\"#H36233285\" class=\"local\">'Dorsiflexion-external rotation test'</a> above.)</p><p>If plain radiographs identify diastasis between the distal tibia and fibula but no fracture, a Grade 3 syndesmotic injury is present and the patient is referred to an orthopedic surgeon for management (see <a href=\"#H36233377\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic consult or referral'</a> below). If plain radiographs identify a fracture, the nature of the fracture and any associated soft tissue injury determine management. All unstable injuries and complex fractures require orthopedic referral. The evaluation and management of ankle and leg fractures are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ankle-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ankle fractures in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibula-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibula fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tibial shaft fractures in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talus-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Talus fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The best approach to subsequent imaging for patients with a clinical diagnosis of syndesmotic injury but normal plain radiographs remains unclear and controversial but clinically important, as patients with Grade 2 injuries may benefit from surgical repair while those with Grade 1 injuries are managed non-operatively (see <a href=\"#H405173321\" class=\"local\">'Distinguishing between Grade 1 and Grade 2 injuries'</a> below). Stress radiographs are of uncertain usefulness and decisions about whether to obtain them should be deferred to surgical consultants. Musculoskeletal ultrasound appears to be an accurate tool for determining injury grade, although published evidence is limited and study quality depends upon the skill of the clinician performing the examination. Another approach is to forego additional imaging if concern about major injury is relatively low based on the clinical assessment and to allow the patient a trial of conservative therapy following an appropriate period of immobilization. Alternatively, when there is greater concern for a more severe (ie, Grade 2) injury or a definitive diagnosis is required (eg, high demand sport or occupation), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study can be obtained. MRI is the best advanced imaging technique for assessing high ankle sprain severity and detecting concomitant injury. However, a clear relationship between MRI findings and clinical outcomes has yet to be established in patients with Grade 2 injuries. (See <a href=\"#H36233328\" class=\"local\">'Stress radiographs'</a> below and <a href=\"#H36233346\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound (US)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H36233334\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)'</a> below.)</p><p>Computed tomography (CT) may have some value for detecting occult fractures and syndesmotic injury, but it is not as useful as MRI for detecting soft tissue injury. (See <a href=\"#H36233340\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomography (CT)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H36233346\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound (US)'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36233322\"><span class=\"h2\">Plain radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When assessing the patient with suspected high ankle sprain, plain radiographs of the ankle should be obtained, including anteroposterior (AP), lateral, and mortise views (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F86799\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86799 \">image 2</a>). Bilateral weight-bearing views are optimal in order to increase the sensitivity for ligamentous instability, but these may cause too much pain to obtain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. AP and lateral views of the entire tibia and fibula should be obtained if there is tenderness proximal to the malleoli. Plain radiographs will detect most ankle and leg fractures but are less sensitive for detecting injuries to the syndesmosis, even when tibiofibular diastasis is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>In addition to identifying fractures, clinicians should assess radiographs carefully for signs of ligamentous instability, which may require surgical management. Widely used parameters (best evaluated on the mortise view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66441\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66441 \">image 3</a>)) are the width of the medial clear space (MCS) (the distance between the medial border of the talus and the lateral border of the medial malleolus measured 5 mm below the talar dome) and the tibiofibular clear space (TFCS) (the distance between the posterolateral tibia and medial fibula measured 10 mm above the tibial articular surface) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F103263\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103263 \">figure 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Based on small studies using MRI correlation, a TFCS on a mortise view radiograph greater than 5.3 mm in non-weight-bearing subjects is approximately 82 percent sensitive and 75 percent specific for syndesmotic injury, and a MCS greater than 2.8 mm is approximately 73 percent sensitive and 59 percent specific for syndesmotic injury and instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Any widening of the MCS should be viewed as significant and likely involves concomitant rupture of the deltoid ligaments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74769\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74769 \">image 4</a>). Other indirect findings suggesting syndesmotic injury include avulsion fractures from the anterolateral tibia adjacent to the syndesmosis.</p><p>Obtaining comparison radiographs of the uninjured ankle is often helpful. Relative widening of the TFCS of 2 mm or more compared with the uninjured side is suggestive of unstable syndesmotic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. While absolute distance of the TFCS exceeding 6 mm was traditionally the main determinant of syndesmosis widening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], this is a poor predictor of syndesmotic injury and need for surgical management, as it can miss up to 57 percent of unstable syndesmotic injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. There is significant individual variation in the absolute clear space distance in uninjured ankles, so absolute distance is less useful than relative difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Measurement of the tibiofibular overlap is not recommended due to wide variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36233328\"><span class=\"h2\">Stress radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain radiographs of the ankle obtained with the leg externally rotated (ie, stress radiographs) have been described as a method for detecting latent instability of the syndesmotic ligaments.

In addition, no study performed in live or unanesthetized patients has confirmed that stress testing is more effective for detecting latent instability than weight-bearing films or MRI.</p><p>It is difficult to perform stress radiographs in primary care settings, and the author recommends deferring to orthopedic consultants about the need for such imaging. Stress images are obtained by applying a standard external rotation force of 7.5 N to the ankle in neutral position and obtaining an AP or mortise view. Any more than 2 mm of laxity compared with non-stress lateral views of the uninjured side is considered unstable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

In unstable syndesmotic injury, the tibiofibular clear space (TFCS) can be seen to widen during DFER stress, compared with its neutral state. Comparison with the uninjured ankle is easily performed and useful. One small controlled study (9 injured, 38 controls) showed 100 percent sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of ATiFL rupture compared with MRI when the TFCS of the injured side during DFER was more than 0.9 mm greater than the uninjured side.

High ankle sprains are suspected when a person (usually an athlete) sustains an injury by a mechanism involving forced dorsiflexion and external rotation of the ankle, and complains of pain just proximal to the ankle joint. Pain is usually present along the lateral half of the distal leg, but not as distal or lateral as the more common anterior talofibular ligament and calcaneofibular ligament (CFL) injuries. Sensitive findings include inability to perform a single-leg hop, localized tenderness over the anterior tibiofibular ligament (ATiFL), and pain at that location induced by the dorsiflexion-external rotation test. Pain at the syndesmosis with the squeeze test is a specific finding. Radiographs are obtained to rule out fracture and frank syndesmotic diastasis. MRI is obtained when a definitive diagnosis is required or the extent of injury must determined, as concomitant injuries are frequently present. Computed tomography (CT) is useful when MRI is not available. A diagnostic algorithm is provided. (See <a href=\"#H36233316\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnostic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H405173321\"><span class=\"h2\">Distinguishing between Grade 1 and Grade 2 injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with a clinically diagnosed syndesmotic injury but negative plain radiographs (no fracture and no diastasis), distinguishing between Grade 1 and Grade 2 injuries can be difficult but it is important, as patients with Grade 2 injuries may benefit from surgical repair while those with Grade 1 injuries are managed non-operatively. Evidence directly related to this diagnostic problem is scant and several reasonable approaches may be used.</p><p>One option is to refer these patients to an orthopedic surgeon with experience managing syndesmotic injuries.</p><p>A second option for clinicians skilled in the performance of musculoskeletal ultrasound is to perform a thorough ultrasound examination including a dynamic assessment to identify whether a complete tear of the ATiFL and partial tear of the IOM are present, and then refer to a surgeon if this is the case or to physical therapy if not. Close follow-up by the clinician remains essential.</p><p>A third option is to perform serial clinical assessments on a weekly basis - after two weeks of immobilization in a fracture boot - using the single-leg hop test. If after two weeks of immobilization the patient is able to perform a single-leg hop test, a Grade 1 injury is diagnosed and the patient managed accordingly. If the patient is unable to perform a single-leg hop test, immobilization is continued for another week. If after three weeks of immobilization the patient remains unable to perform the test, a Grade 2 injury is assumed and the patient is either referred to an experienced surgeon or advanced diagnostic imaging, usually MRI, is obtained to determine the extent of injury. </p><p>A fourth option for patients felt to be at higher risk for Grade 2 injury based on the history and examination, or who require a definitive diagnosis due to the high demands of their sport or occupation, is to obtain an MRI as part of the initial evaluation. Given the limited outcome data pertaining to this subpopulation of patients, there are undoubtedly other good approaches to their evaluation, but the options described above are reasonable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36233377\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR ORTHOPEDIC CONSULT OR REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Orthopedic referral is indicated for Grade 2 and Grade 3 syndesmosis injuries because the resulting instability is debilitating, may not heal well or rapidly with conservative therapy, and may result in degenerative arthritis if not reduced. Any Grade 1 injuries with associated fractures should be referred since they may require operative intervention as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H933903453\" class=\"local\">'Injury grade'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36233383\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of high ankle sprains includes a number of bony and soft tissue injuries. Many ankle fractures have concurrent syndesmotic injury and three quarters of patients with syndesmotic injury who have normal radiographs have a concurrent bony or ligamentous injury.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fibular fracture</strong> &ndash; A lateral malleolar fracture may be sustained concurrently with syndesmotic injury. Tenderness along the posterior margin of the distal 6 cm of the fibula suggests such injury. A proximal fracture of the fibula (Maisonneuve fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F80672\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80672 \">image 1</a>)) may be a complication of unstable syndesmotic injury. With this injury, the proximal fibula is markedly tender, typically around the fibular neck. Radiographs of the ankle and leg identify these fractures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ankle-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ankle fractures in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibula-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibula fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tibial fracture</strong> &ndash; An avulsion fracture of the anterior tubercle of the tibia can accompany unstable syndesmotic injury. The patient will be tender along the anterolateral tibia just proximal to the ankle joint line, adjacent to the anterior tibiofibular ligament (ATiFL). This can be detected by ankle radiograph in most cases, or by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tibial fractures in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Talar fracture</strong> &ndash; Fracture of the talar head, neck, or dome causes deep ankle pain. In head and neck fractures, tenderness is present at the dorsal midfoot at or distal to the tibiotalar joint line. With talar dome fractures, tenderness may be present at the joint line, or the fracture may be too deep to palpate, but an ankle effusion is typically present. Plain radiographs often reveal these fractures but miss a significant number. If talar fracture is suspected despite negative radiographs, CT or MRI should be obtained. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talus-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Talus fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL) sprain</strong> &ndash; Inversion ankle injuries explain most ATFL sprains, in contrast to the external rotation mechanism that produces high ankle sprains. However, these injuries can occur concomitantly. With ATFL sprains, tenderness is present at the anterolateral ankle but more distal than with syndesmotic injury: just distal to the tibiotalar joint line at the anterior aspect of the lateral malleolus. High-grade ATFL injury causes laxity with ankle drawer testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58891\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58891 \">picture 4</a>). Resting or standing ankle radiographs do not reveal instability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ankle-sprain#H8653137\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ankle sprain&quot;, section on 'Special tests'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Calcaneofibular ligament (CFL) sprain</strong> &mdash;&ndash; Inversion injury accounts for most CFL injuries. Tenderness is present at the lateral ankle just distal to the lateral malleolus. Concurrent ATFL injury is likely. High-Grade CFL injury causes laxity with inversion testing (talar tilt test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51938\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51938 \">picture 5</a>)). Resting or standing ankle radiographs do not reveal instability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ankle-sprain#H8653137\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ankle sprain&quot;, section on 'Special tests'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Posterior talofibular ligament (PTFL) sprain</strong> &ndash; Severe inversion ankle sprains may injure the PTFL. Tenderness is present at the posterolateral ankle. Concurrent ATFL and CFL sprains are likely. Instability may be present with the drawer and talar tilt tests.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Deltoid ligament sprain</strong> &ndash; Deltoid ligament sprains may occur in isolation or concurrently with syndesmotic injury. A mechanism involving ankle eversion is more likely to produce an isolated injury, whereas an external rotation mechanism that injures the syndesmosis is more likely to rupture the anterior portion of the deltoid ligament as well. Tenderness is present at the medial ankle just distal to the medial malleolus. Any widening of the medial clear space on mortise view radiographs suggests deltoid ligament rupture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74769\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74769 \">image 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ankle-sprain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ankle sprain&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anterior ankle impingement</strong> &ndash; Injury to an intra-articular accessory ligament of the ATiFL, called Bassett's ligament, can cause pain in the anterolateral ankle similar to syndesmosis injury. An ankle inversion mechanism is more likely to cause this injury, rather than external rotation, and it is generally associated with much less pain than a high ankle sprain. Tenderness may occur in the same location as the syndesmosis but is more often isolated to the joint line just at or distal to the ATiFL. No signs of instability of the syndesmosis are apparent on radiographs. Definitive diagnosis is by MRI or arthroscopy, and treatment is surgical excision of the accessory ligament [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bone bruises</strong> &ndash; Bone bruises can occur as isolated injuries from nearly any mechanism of ankle injury, or can develop concurrently with high ankle sprains. Focal bony tenderness (fibula, talus, tibia) with negative radiographs suggests the diagnosis. When necessary, MRI is the definitive method for establishing the diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute compartment syndrome</strong> &ndash; Severe injuries of the leg or calf, such as crush injuries, fractures, or severe contusions, can cause marked swelling within a soft tissue compartment that may compromise normal neurovascular function. This limb-threatening condition is termed acute compartment syndrome and it is a surgical emergency. ACS can develop in any of the leg compartments: anterior, lateral, deep posterior, or superficial posterior (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68629 \">figure 9</a>). Findings associated with ACS include pain out of proportion to the injury, paresthesias, pain with passive stretch of the muscles in the affected compartment (eg, by passively flexing and extending the toes or ankle), and a palpably tense compartment. Imaging may detect various injuries but is not diagnostic for ACS. If ACS is suspected, immediate consultation with orthopedic surgery should be obtained for evaluation and likely measurement of compartment pressures.

By this time, most swelling has resolved and more definitive protection or immobilization can be used. The patient should be immobilized initially with a removable fracture boot that prevents any ankle motion, using crutches for non-weight-bearing or partial weight-bearing as determined by pain and the clinical scenario, for one to three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36233487\"><span class=\"h2\">Rehabilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once partial weight-bearing is painless, the patient may progress to full weight-bearing. Weekly follow-up with the treating physician is recommended in order to determine the earliest safe time to discontinue immobilization. Once the fracture boot is discontinued, we suggest early referral to physical therapy to expedite functional recovery. However, protection should be maintained for several weeks using an off-the-shelf stirrup brace or articulated ankle-foot orthosis during weightbearing activity until full function is regained.</p><p>High quality evidence pertaining to physical therapy for syndesmotic injury is limited, but one prospective observational study involving 60 consecutive high level United States collegiate athletes with a clinical diagnosis of high ankle sprain describes the aggressive, accelerated implementation of a standard treatment protocol that resulted in a rapid return to play (average 13.4 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

From day 6 onward they performed full weight-bearing and continued progressive motion, strength, and proprioceptive exercise. When they were able to perform 10 single-leg hops on their toes without noticeable difficulty, they were allowed to begin progressive functional and sport-specific training while protected in an ankle splint. During their return to sport, athletes had their ankles taped and wore an ankle splint for protection.

Fractures repaired with cortical screws usually require hardware removal at three months postoperation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], whereas those with suture button usually do not need hardware removal.

Nevertheless, decisions about the best surgical approach vary by clinical circumstance and local expertise and are best made after discussion between the surgeon and patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36233551\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A syndesmotic ankle sprain is an injury to one or more of the ligaments comprising the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis; it is often referred to as a &quot;high ankle sprain.&quot; Syndesmotic ankle injury is much less common than the typical ankle sprain, but is associated more often with significant morbidity and the need for surgical treatment. Syndesmotic injury is more common among athletes playing high level sport. Participants in American football and ice hockey appear to be at increased risk. The ankle anatomy of particular relevance to syndesmotic injury is reviewed in the text. (See <a href=\"#H36233261\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H36233267\" class=\"local\">'Clinical anatomy and biomechanics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High ankle sprains typically occur during high-intensity athletic activities such as competitive American football, soccer (football), ice hockey, and other contact sports, and downhill skiing. An external rotation force applied to a dorsiflexed ankle is the most common mechanism. This can happen when the leg is rotated forcefully against a planted foot or toe. Most such injuries occur during contact with other athletes either when the athlete is standing and the foot is forced into dorsiflexion and external rotation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F101955\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101955 \">figure 7</a>), or when the athlete is prone on the ground and another athlete steps or lands on their posterior leg while the foot is externally rotated. (See <a href=\"#H36233273\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain from a syndesmotic injury is usually focused along the anterolateral ankle but may be more diffuse and severe if medial ligaments are disrupted. Athletes with severe injuries are usually unable to continue sport activity due to severe pain with any weight bearing. Common findings in patients with a high ankle sprain include antalgic gait or inability to bear weight, lateral and possibly anterior ankle edema, as well as tenderness over the anterior tibiofibular ligament (ATiFL) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66111\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66111 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F102840\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102840 \">picture 3</a>) and possibly more proximally along the interosseous membrane (IOM). Sensitive signs for syndesmotic injury include tenderness over the ATiFL, inability to perform a single-leg hop, and a painful dorsiflexion-external rotation test. A painful squeeze test is a specific finding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F102841\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102841 \">picture 7</a>). (See <a href=\"#H36233279\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation and examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard plain radiographs of the ankle are the initial imaging studies obtained if a syndesmotic injury is suspected. If plain radiographs identify a fracture or diastasis between the distal tibia and fibula but no fracture (ie, Grade 3 syndesmotic injury), the patient is referred to an orthopedic surgeon. The best approach to subsequent imaging for patients with a clinical diagnosis of syndesmotic injury but normal plain radiographs remains controversial. Stress radiographs are of uncertain usefulness and decisions about whether to obtain them should be deferred to surgical consultants. Musculoskeletal ultrasound appears to be an accurate tool for determining injury grade, but published evidence is limited. When there is concern for a severe injury or a definitive diagnosis is required, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study can be obtained. MRI is the best advanced imaging technique for assessing high ankle sprain severity and detecting concomitant injury. (See <a href=\"#H933903453\" class=\"local\">'Injury grade'</a> above and <a href=\"#H36233309\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H36233316\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnostic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitive diagnosis of a syndesmotic injury is made by MRI, but this is often unnecessary and a clinical diagnosis can generally be made based on the history and examination findings. One of the most difficult aspects of evaluating a high ankle sprain is distinguishing between Grade 1 (partial tear of ATiFL; treated conservatively) and Grade 2 (complete tear of ATiFL; generally treated surgically) injuries. Evidence pertaining directly to the evaluation of these injuries is limited and any of several reasonable approaches may be used. These approaches are described in the text. (See <a href=\"#H405173321\" class=\"local\">'Distinguishing between Grade 1 and Grade 2 injuries'</a> above and <a href=\"#H36233352\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Referral to a knowledgeable orthopedic surgeon is indicated for Grade 2 and Grade 3 syndesmosis injuries and any Grade 1 injury associated with a fracture. (See <a href=\"#H36233377\" class=\"local\">'Indications for orthopedic consult or referral'</a> above and <a href=\"#H933903453\" class=\"local\">'Injury grade'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis for syndesmotic injury includes ankle fracture (eg, fibula, tibia, talus), ligament sprain (eg, ATFL, CFL, PTiFL, deltoid), anterior ankle impingement, and acute compartment syndrome of the leg, which is a surgical emergency. Key clinical features that help to distinguish among these diagnoses are provided in the text. (See <a href=\"#H36233383\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basic initial care, including non-weightbearing, is provided for all injuries. Subsequent management depends upon the extent of injury. Isolated Grade 1 injuries are treated with physical therapy; injuries of Grade 2 or 3 and those associated with fractures or other significant soft tissue injury are referred to an orthopedic surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H36233443\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H36233474\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up care'</a> above and <a href=\"#H36233525\" class=\"local\">'Return to sport or work'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syndesmotic-ankle-injury-high-ankle-sprain/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Vosseller JT, Karl JW, Greisberg JK.
