These manifestations vary in severity and can be more debilitating than the underlying IBD. While some extraintestinal manifestations parallel the disease activity of IBD (eg, erythema nodosum, episcleritis, and Sweet syndrome), the course of others (eg, pyoderma gangrenosum, uveitis) is independent of intestinal inflammation.</p><p>This topic will review the skin and eye manifestations of IBD. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease are discussed separately.

However, data suggest that 6 to 40 percent of patients with IBD have one or more extraintestinal manifestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatologic-and-ocular-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Up to 15 percent of patients have a cutaneous manifestation of IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatologic-and-ocular-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Ocular manifestations of IBD occur in 4 to 10 percent of patients and may be more likely to occur in patients with Crohn disease as compared with ulcerative colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatologic-and-ocular-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of extraintestinal manifestations in patients with IBD is incompletely understood. However, it is hypothesized that the diseased gastrointestinal mucosa may trigger an immune response at the extraintestinal site due to shared epitopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatologic-and-ocular-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Triggers of the autoimmune response in certain organs may be influenced by genetic factors. Associations of extraintestinal manifestations of IBD with major histocompatibility complex loci have also been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatologic-and-ocular-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As an example, HLA-B27 and HLA-B58 are associated with ocular inflammation in patients with IBD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DERMATOLOGIC DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Erythema nodosum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Erythema nodosum is the most common dermatologic manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), occurring in 3 to 10 percent of patients with ulcerative colitis and 4 to 15 percent of patients with Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatologic-and-ocular-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Lesions typically consist of raised, tender, red or violet subcutaneous nodules that are 1 to 5 cm in diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80056\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80056 \">picture 1</a>). The nodules are most commonly located on the extensor surfaces of the extremities, particularly over the anterior tibial area. Biopsy of these lesions shows focal panniculitis. However, the diagnosis is most often clinical, and biopsy is required only in atypical cases (eg, patients with no lesions on the legs, persistence beyond six to eight weeks, or the development of ulceration). </p><p>The appearance of erythema nodosum usually parallels intestinal disease activity, and treatment directed at the underlying IBD usually results in resolution of the lesions. Skin lesions rarely precede the onset of IBD, or occur during quiescent phases of IBD; in these settings, therapy with other treatments, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, may be required. The management of erythema nodosum is discussed separately. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pyoderma gangrenosum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pyoderma gangrenosum is the second most common dermatologic manifestation of IBD. However, the proportion of patients with IBD who develop pyoderma gangrenosum appears to be small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatologic-and-ocular-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In one cohort study that included 2402 patients with IBD, pyoderma gangrenosum was detected in only 0.75 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatologic-and-ocular-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The lesions initially appear as single or multiple erythematous papules or pustules that are often preceded by trauma to the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F53733\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53733 \">picture 2</a>). They occur most commonly on the legs, but can develop in any area of the body, including the abdominal wall adjacent to the stoma after colectomy or surgical scars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatologic-and-ocular-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Subsequent necrosis of the dermis leads to the development of deep ulcerations that contain purulent material that is usually sterile on culture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52528\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52528 \">picture 3</a>). Biopsy reveals nonspecific findings consistent with a sterile abscess (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59489\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59489 \">picture 4</a>).

In patients with active IBD and pyoderma gangrenosum, therapy with systemic steroids usually results in healing. Pyoderma gangrenosum is also responsive to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatologic-and-ocular-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of pyoderma gangrenosum are discussed in detail, separately.

Skin lesions are most commonly seen on the head, neck, and upper extremities. Episcleritis is a frequent ocular finding. Sweet syndrome is usually associated with active IBD, but may precede the onset of intestinal symptoms in approximately 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatologic-and-ocular-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Biopsy of the lesion reveals an intense neutrophilic infiltrate without evidence of vasculitis. The lesions of Sweet syndrome usually respond quickly to oral glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatologic-and-ocular-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of Sweet syndrome are discussed in detail, separately.

Patients characteristically have aseptic sterile collections with a neutrophil predominant infiltrate. These sterile abscesses are usually located in the spleen, but approximately 20 percent of patients have cutaneous abscesses. Both systemic corticosteroids and TNF antagonists have been effective in treating aseptic abscess syndrome in small observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatologic-and-ocular-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, the disease frequently follows a relapsing course.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bowel-associated dermatosis-arthritis syndrome</strong> &ndash; Patients with bowel-associated dermatosis-arthritis syndrome present with a serum sickness-like syndrome characterized by fever, chills, malaise, arthralgia, arthritis, and myalgia, which frequently precede the skin eruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatologic-and-ocular-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients may have associated diarrhea due to active inflammation from underlying IBD. The aseptic non-erosive polyarthritis is asymmetric, episodic, and affects both small and large joints. The most characteristic cutaneous skin lesions are erythematous macules up to 1 cm in diameter that develop a central papulovesicle or pustule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F98997\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98997 \">picture 6</a>). The eruption most often occurs on the upper extremities and trunk. Treatment consists of management of the underlying IBD with glucocorticoids. In refractory cases, other immunosuppressive agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> or TNF antagonists, may be required.

Scleritis is usually associated with a severe, constant, boring pain that worsens at night or in the early morning hours and radiates to the face and periorbital region. The extraocular muscles insert into the sclera, which explains why ocular movements exacerbate the pain associated with scleral inflammation. The pain generally limits activity and often prevents sleep. Additional symptoms include headache, watering of the eye, ocular redness, and photophobia. Diffuse anterior scleritis is associated with widespread ocular erythema and scleral edema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55397\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55397 \">picture 12</a>). When posterior scleritis occurs in isolation, the eye is white. However, inflammation of parts of the posterior sclera can be seen at extremes of the patient's gaze. Scleritis does not parallel the disease activity of IBD and may precede or follow the diagnosis of IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatologic-and-ocular-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Uveitis may precede diagnosis of IBD and may be associated with an axial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peripheral arthritis. It is four times more common in females as compared with males. It is insidious in onset and can recur in the contralateral eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatologic-and-ocular-manifestations-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Anterior uveitis may produce pain and redness; posterior or intermediate uveitis is more likely to be painless, but is often associated with floaters <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> some degree of visual loss. The uveitis in patients with IBD more commonly involves the posterior uveal tract. The diagnosis requires slit-lamp examination and a dilated fundus examination to detect inflammation of the uveal tract. Corneal clouding and conjunctival injection may also be seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75384\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75384 \">picture 13</a>).

Up to 15 percent of patients have a cutaneous manifestation of IBD. Ocular manifestations of IBD occur in 4 to 10 percent of patients with IBD, occurring more often in Crohn disease as compared with ulcerative colitis. While some extraintestinal manifestations parallel the disease activity of IBD (eg, erythema nodosum, episcleritis, and Sweet syndrome), the course of others (eg, pyoderma gangrenosum, uveitis) is independent of intestinal inflammation. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H518779762\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of extraintestinal manifestations is incompletely understood. However, it is hypothesized that the diseased gastrointestinal mucosa may trigger an immune response at the extraintestinal site due to shared epitopes. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythema nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum are the most common dermatologic manifestations of IBD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80056\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80056 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F53733\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53733 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52528\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52528 \">picture 3</a>). Other rare dermatologic diseases in patients with IBD include neutrophilic dermatoses (eg, Sweet syndrome), cutaneous vasculitis, metastatic Crohn disease, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F74393\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74393 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F94489\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94489 \">picture 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62505\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62505 \">picture 9</a>). Patients with IBD are also at an increased risk for melanoma. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Dermatologic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythema nodosum typically appears as raised, tender, red or violet subcutaneous nodules on the extensor surfaces of extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80056\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80056 \">picture 1</a>). As erythema nodosum usually parallels intestinal disease activity, treatment is directed at the underlying IBD. If skin nodules precede any bowel symptoms or occur during quiescent phases of IBD, therapy with other medications, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, may be required. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Erythema nodosum'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythema-nodosum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Erythema nodosum&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pyoderma gangrenosum lesions may appear as erythematous papules or pustules that are often preceded by trauma to the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F53733\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53733 \">picture 2</a>). Subsequent necrosis of the dermis leads to the development of deep ulcers. Therapy directed at the underlying IBD usually results in healing.
