This difference impacts treatment decisions regarding the use of macrolide-containing regimens (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Susceptibility testing'</a> below). However, these subspecies are difficult to distinguish in the clinical laboratory, and so subspecies designation is frequently unavailable (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Mycobacterial species identification'</a> below). Further confusing the subspecies designation is that the organism now characterized as <em>M. abscessus</em> subspecies <em>massiliense</em> had historically been labeled <em>M. bolletii</em> (or included as part of <em>M. abscessus</em> subspecies <em>bolletii</em>) by certain groups.</p><p>There is no authoritative organization that dictates the appropriate nomenclature and species or subspecies status for mycobacteria. Rather, the names and species or subspecies designations of mycobacterial organisms are determined based on various factors, including DNA sequences and patterns of nomenclature usage in the scientific literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapidly-growing-mycobacterial-infections-mycobacteria-abscessus-chelonae-and-fortuitum/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The nomenclature detailed above is consistent with a proposal from an international group (including the author of this topic) to designate these three subspecies based on genomic data and phenotypic data regarding the <em>erm</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapidly-growing-mycobacterial-infections-mycobacteria-abscessus-chelonae-and-fortuitum/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].This nomenclature will be utilized as much as possible in this topic.

In addition, the RGM are not susceptible in vitro to antituberculous drugs, and treatment requires antimicrobial therapy based on susceptibility results that vary between different RGM species. When cultures are submitted, the lab should be alerted to the possibility of RGM.

Minimal evaluation should include three or more sputum samples for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and efforts to exclude other confounding disorders, such as tuberculosis and lung malignancy. In most patients, a diagnosis can be made without a lung biopsy. Although American Thoracic Society criteria are based on experience with <em>M. avium</em> complex infection, there is no reason to believe these criteria would not be applicable to other species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rapidly-growing-mycobacterial-infections-mycobacteria-abscessus-chelonae-and-fortuitum/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

However, identification of RGM in most laboratories is either incomplete or imprecise. <em>M. abscessus</em> isolates are frequently identified simply as &quot;<em>M. <span class=\"nowrap\">chelonae/abscessus</em></span> complex,&quot; or if they are specifically identified as &quot;<em>M. abscessus</em>,&quot; they are not accurately sub-speciated. Clinicians should be familiar with the capabilities of their clinical laboratories with regards to speciating and reporting of RGM (in particular, <em>M. abscessus</em>). The recommendations in this topic rely on accurate laboratory identification of the RGM isolated. Accurate interpretation of studies of RGM also depends on the methods used for identifying RGM isolates; many studies prior to the last few years did not use adequate laboratory techniques to make accurate species <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subspecies identification.</p><p>Only molecular methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction endonuclease assay (PRA), can reliably differentiate between <em>M. abscessus</em> and <em>M. chelonae</em> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacteria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology of nontuberculous mycobacteria&quot;</a>).

These rapid methods are recommended for identification of NTM when possible; they include high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and commercial DNA probes, but neither is optimal for RGM. No commercial DNA probes are available for RGM.

The <em>erm</em> gene is an inducible macrolide resistance gene that may not be reflected in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the organism for macrolides. In other words, <em>M. fortuitum</em> and <em>M. abscessus</em> subspecies <em>abscessus</em> isolates may be resistant to macrolides in vivo but may still exhibit a &quot;susceptible&quot; MIC in vitro on initial in vitro susceptibility testing. All <em>M. abscessus</em> isolates, including <em>M. abscessus</em> subspecies <em>abscessus</em> <em>M. abscessus </em>subspecies<em> massiliense</em>, should have MICs for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a> determined before and after extended (eg, 14 days) incubation with clarithromycin to evaluate the presence of an active <em>erm</em> gene.

(See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Nonpulmonary disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Susceptibility testing should be performed on all clinically significant isolates as well as isolates that have been recovered after treatment failure or relapse because of differences in susceptibilities among species of rapidly growing mycobacteria.

In other words, such isolates may be resistant to macrolides in vivo but may still exhibit a &quot;susceptible&quot; MIC in vitro. Testing for the inducible resistance should be performed. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clarithromycin</a> appears more likely to induce the macrolide resistance gene than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> but the therapeutic implications of these findings are unknown.

Initial treatment should continue until clinical improvement is evident (two to six weeks) and be followed by oral therapy with two agents, if susceptibility patterns allow.

Initial treatment is at least for 8 to 12 weeks. Options for subsequent therapy include continuing the regimen until sputum culture is negative for 12 months, discontinuing the regimen once symptoms have resolved with plans to restart if disease worsens, and use of oral agents.

Removal of foreign bodies (eg, breast implants, percutaneous catheters) is essential for cure. Surgical resection for limited pulmonary disease may be curative, however, the decision to perform surgery should be made by clinicians with experience in the treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial disease. Thoracic surgery for <em>M. abscessus</em> infection may be associated with significant complications even in expert hands and should only be performed in centers with extensive experience.
