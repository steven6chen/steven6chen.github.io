There are about four million cases of chlamydia in the United States every year.</p><p>Chlamydia and gonorrhea (another sexually transmitted infection) cause similar signs and symptoms, including discharge from the penis or vagina and pain with urination. However, chlamydia usually causes no symptoms. In addition, chlamydia can cause serious long-term complications in women who are not treated. Fortunately, chlamydia is curable with antibiotic treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gonorrhea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Gonorrhea (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More detailed information about chlamydia is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CHLAMYDIA CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chlamydia infections are caused by a bacterium, Chlamydia trachomatis, which can infect the genital tract of women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>) and men (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F68075\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68075 \">figure 2</a>). The infection is spread during intimate sexual contact. A man does not have to ejaculate to spread the infection. It is not possible to become infected with chlamydia by touching an object like a toilet seat.</p><p>Your risk of getting chlamydia is greater if you have a new sexual partner, more than one sexual partner, or if you have had chlamydia before and have sex with a partner who wasn&rsquo;t treated for this infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CHLAMYDIA SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chlamydia infections can cause mild to severe symptoms. However, most people have no symptoms at all. This means that it is easy to spread the infection without ever knowing you are infected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to 90 percent of women with chlamydia have no symptoms at all. Of those who do, the most common symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal discharge</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal vaginal bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain during sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning or pain with urination</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Men</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to 70 percent of men with chlamydia have no symptoms at all. The most common symptoms of chlamydia in men include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning or pain with urination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discharge from the penis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain or tenderness of the testicles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling in the scrotum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F68075\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68075 \">figure 2</a>)</p><p/><p>Men who have sex with men can develop a chlamydia infection in the rectum or anus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Related disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uncommonly, people with chlamydia develop a form of arthritis, called reactive arthritis. It can cause a cluster of seemingly unrelated features, including joint pain (arthritis) and uveitis (an inflammation of the inner part of the eye). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-arthritis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Reactive arthritis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chlamydia can also cause an inflammation of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis). This can be caused by exposure to genital fluids, such as semen or vaginal discharge, from a person infected with the bacteria. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CHLAMYDIA DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing for chlamydia is done in a doctor or nurse's office with a sample of urine or with a swab of fluid from the vagina or from the cervix (in women) or urethra (in men). Results are usually available within 24 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14829205\"><span class=\"h1\">CHLAMYDIA SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once-yearly testing for chlamydia is recommended for all sexually active women who are younger than 25 years old, even in the absence of symptoms. This is because chlamydia is common in this age group and infection usually does not cause symptoms. Treating this infection can prevent some of the major problems it causes, especially infection of the female reproductive organs, as described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TESTING FOR OTHER SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you or your sexual partner are diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection like chlamydia, you should have testing for other infections, including HIV, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, and syphilis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testing-for-hiv-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Testing for HIV (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gonorrhea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Gonorrhea (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CHLAMYDIA COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chlamydia in women can lead to a serious infection called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). If chlamydia is not treated, up to 30 percent of women may develop PID. PID can cause scarring of the fallopian tubes, which can lead to infertility and an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy (a pregnancy that develops in the fallopian tube rather than the uterus) or chronic pelvic pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-tubal-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Ectopic (tubal) pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CHLAMYDIA TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of chlamydia is the same for women and men. For most infections, experts recommend a one-time antibiotic treatment that is taken by mouth, azithromycin. Azithromycin is safe to take during pregnancy.</p><p>Anyone who is allergic to azithromycin (or erythromycin) can take another antibiotic, doxycycline, but this must be taken twice daily for 7 days. It is important not to have sex during this treatment. Doxycycline is not used in pregnant women because of the risk of harm to developing teeth and bones in the fetus.</p><p>Some people who are infected with chlamydia may also be infected with gonorrhea. Thus, testing for gonorrhea is sometimes done at the same time as chlamydia testing. If the patient has both infections, additional treatment for gonorrhea will be needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gonorrhea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Gonorrhea (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Sexual partner treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is important for you and anyone you have had sex with recently (the last 60 days, or the last person you had sex with), whether or not he or she has symptoms or has a negative test for chlamydia. This is because not all infections cause symptoms, and because the test might not detect a recent infection, which could have been the source of your infection. Your doctor or nurse might ask you to tell your sexual partner(s) to be treated. In some cases, your doctor or nurse may give you a prescription for both you and your partner.</p><p>You should not have sex until one week passes after both you and your partner have completed treatment. It is possible to be infected with chlamydia more than once, and the most common reason for this is failure to treat sexual partners.</p><p>If you take the recommended treatment, you will not need to be tested in the short term (1 to 2 months) to make sure that the chlamydia is gone unless you continue to have symptoms. If symptoms do recur or occur for the first time after you are treated you should see your doctor or nurse again.</p><p>However, anyone with chlamydia should have another test for chlamydia three to six months after their diagnosis, because many people (as many as 25 percent in some studies) are re-infected from untreated sexual partners.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CHLAMYDIA PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most effective way to prevent chlamydia is to avoid sexual intercourse. Because this is not practical for most people, the following tips are recommended:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men should use a latex condom every time they have sex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discuss testing for sexually transmitted infections with your doctor or nurse. If you are a woman under 25 years old, ask if you are due for your annual chlamydia screening. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>See your doctor or nurse if you have any symptoms of chlamydia or another infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not have sex if you or your sexual partner has abnormal discharge, burning with urination, or a genital rash or sore.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=4015\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
