Patients with severe obstruction have inadequate pulmonary flow, and typically present in the immediate newborn period with profound cyanosis. These patients may need urgent therapy. Patients with moderate obstruction and balanced pulmonary and systemic flow usually come to clinical attention during elective evaluation for a murmur. These children may also present with hypercyanotic (&quot;tet&quot;) spells when RVOT is obstructed during periods of agitation. Patients with minimal obstruction may present with increased pulmonary blood flow and heart failure. In addition, some affected newborns will be detected by an evaluation prompted by a failed oximetry screening test.

Though commonly used in other types of heart failure, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are generally <strong>not</strong> used in patients with heart failure due to TOF because they can decrease SVR and may promote a hypercyanotic (&quot;tet&quot;) spell.

A small minority of infants require palliative shunts prior to surgical repair. Shunts may be necessary due to medically refractory hypercyanotic (&quot;tet&quot;) spells or severe right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction in infants who are not initially acceptable candidates for intracardiac repair due to prematurity, hypoplastic pulmonary arteries, or coronary artery anatomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69025847\"><span class=\"h2\">Intracardiac repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of surgical repair are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relief of RVOT obstruction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete separation between the pulmonary and systemic circulations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preservation of right ventricular function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimize post-procedure pulmonary valvular incompetence</p><p/><p>The excellent results of primary intracardiac repair for infants with TOF have made it the treatment of choice for all patients with TOF at most centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-tetralogy-of-fallot/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. This includes asymptomatic acyanotic infants (pink variant), as surgical correction allows normal growth of the RVOT and pulmonary annulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-tetralogy-of-fallot/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The surgery consists of patch closure of the ventricular septal defect (VSD), thereby separating the pulmonary and systemic circulation, and enlargement of the RVOT, relieving obstructed pulmonary flow. RVOT enlargement is accomplished by relieving pulmonary stenosis, resecting infundibular and subinfundibular muscle bundles, and, if necessary, by a transannular patch, creating unobstructed flow from the right ventricle (RV) into the pulmonary arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67062\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67062 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>When feasible, a transatrial approach is utilized to access the RVOT and close the VSD in an effort to avoid ventriculotomy, which carries a risk for late ventricular arrhythmias. This approach is most likely to be successful in patients with discrete infundibular stenosis and an adequate pulmonary annulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-tetralogy-of-fallot/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Increasingly, surgical approaches emphasize maintaining pulmonary valve competence whenever possible. A &quot;valve sparing approach&quot; is easily applied to individuals with adequate pulmonary annulus size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-tetralogy-of-fallot/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. However, in patients with borderline pulmonary valve annulus sizes, this approach necessitates balancing some degree of residual RVOT obstruction against the obligate insufficiency associated with a transannular patch, which renders the pulmonary valve incompetent. Consensus is lacking on the size of the pulmonary annulus and the acceptable degree of residual outflow tract obstruction that is amenable to a valve sparing approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-tetralogy-of-fallot/abstract/9,10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,12</a>]. Though there is increasing emphasis on preservation of pulmonary valve function, two large database studies (the Society of Thoracic Surgeons 2002 to 2007 and the European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery Congenital Database 1999 to 2011) demonstrated that ventriculotomy with transannular patch repair remains the most common strategy for repair of TOF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-tetralogy-of-fallot/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>].</p><p>An alternate surgical procedure is insertion of a valved conduit from the RV to the distal main pulmonary artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67062\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67062 \">figure 2</a>). However, stenosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> regurgitation of the conduit prosthetic valve, as well as stenosis of the conduit, can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-tetralogy-of-fallot/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A monocusp valve may also be placed in the RVOT at the time of transannular patch in an attempt to decrease pulmonary insufficiency. However, it is unclear whether the presence of these valves affects the postoperative course or severity of pulmonary insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H99136583\" class=\"local\">'Chronic pulmonary regurgitation'</a> below.)</p><p>Historically, TOF repair was performed in two staged procedures: a palliative shunt in early infancy followed by intracardiac repair later in childhood. However, at most centers this approach has been replaced with primary intracardiac repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-tetralogy-of-fallot/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. Palliative shunts are reserved for cases wherein primary repair is not feasible. (See <a href=\"#H809366402\" class=\"local\">'Palliative shunts'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is usually performed electively in the first year of life, with the majority of repairs performed before age six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-tetralogy-of-fallot/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The timing and choice of surgical intervention is based on individual patient characteristics and center-specific practice.</p><p>If the RVOT obstruction is not severe and the patient can be managed medically, it is generally preferable to defer elective surgical repair until after the neonatal period (typically around three to four months of age). This allows pulmonary vascular resistance to decline and gives time for the infant to grow to a larger size.</p><p>Infants with more severe RVOT obstruction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ductal dependency may require early surgical intervention within the neonatal period. Primary intracardiac repair is generally the preferred approach in these cases; however, surgical practice varies between centers. In addition, primary surgical repair may not be feasible in some patients due to the size of the infant (eg, preterm infants) or anatomy (eg, unfavorable coronary anatomy). Palliative shunts may be warranted in such cases. (See <a href=\"#H809366402\" class=\"local\">'Palliative shunts'</a> below.)</p><p>Studies are conflicting as to whether repair during the neonatal period (first 28 days of life) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-tetralogy-of-fallot/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. In a meta-analysis of eight observational studies including nearly 4000 patients, surgical repair during the neonatal period compared with later repair was associated with increased mortality (6 versus 1 percent; odds ratio [OR] 3.2; 95% CI 1.06-9.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-tetralogy-of-fallot/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, given the observational nature of these data and the inability to control for severity of RVOT obstruction, the findings may be due to confounding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H627886423\"><span class=\"h3\">Perioperative complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the immediate postoperative period, residual lesions such as VSDs and RVOT obstruction may persist. In some cases, reoperations or interventional catheterization may need to be performed if these lesions are hemodynamically significant. Residual VSDs may be &quot;intramural defects&quot; and more challenging to identify intraoperatively or by imaging. Intervention for residual RVOT obstruction is indicated for RV pressures greater than or equal to 70 percent systemic pressure.</p><p>Small atrial communications are often purposefully retained at the time of operative repair to allow atrial decompression in the postoperative period secondary to RV dysfunction. These most commonly do not require intervention.</p><p>Other perioperative complications may include low cardiac output, cardiopulmonary arrest, arrhythmia, heart block, bleeding, and pulmonary artery branch stenosis. In a report of 277 infants who underwent primary intracardiac repair at a single center, postoperative complications occurred in 12 percent and included cardiopulmonary arrest (6 patients), reoperation for bleeding (10 patients), residual lesions (3 patients), pacemaker placement (1 patient), and interventional catheterization with left pulmonary artery stent placement (1 patient) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-tetralogy-of-fallot/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Chronic postoperative complications that may require subsequent reintervention include pulmonary regurgitation, pulmonary artery branch stenosis, and residual RVOT obstruction. These issues are discussed below.

There were no deaths within 30 days of surgery, and there were two late deaths after a median follow-up time of 4.7 years. Seven of the 88 survivors required reoperation, and 12 reintervention. </p><p>In another single center study, there were no perioperative deaths among a selective group of 277 infants with TOF (all had been discharged home after birth; all were &le;6 months old at the time of surgery; the repair was elective in all cases; and none had previous interventions, hypercyanotic episodes, or intensive care admissions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-tetralogy-of-fallot/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H627885942\"><span class=\"h3\">Adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although it is now a rare occurrence, TOF remains the most common cyanotic malformation to reach adulthood without surgical repair. Even in older adult patients, complete repair is feasible resulting in improved function. However, there is an increased operative risk compared with younger patients, and repair is often complicated by previous palliative surgery and the need for pulmonary valve replacement or preservation.</p><p>In a case series of 52 adult patients (&ge;40 years old) who underwent TOF repair between 1970 and 2007, procedures for repair included pulmonary valve replacement (n = 10), transannular patch (n = 10), and native pulmonary valve preservation (n = 32) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-outcome-of-tetralogy-of-fallot/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Approximately one-half the patients in the series had had previous palliative surgery. Three patients died during the perioperative period and during a mean follow-up of 15 years, 29 of the 49 remaining survivors died. The 10-year survival rate was lower compared with an age- and sex-matched population (73 versus 91 percent), and compared with patients with TOF operated on at a younger age who had an expected 20-year survival rate of 86 percent.

Follow-up care is focused on identifying and managing long-term complications. It encompasses annual or more frequent routine health care visits with a focused cardiac history and physical examination. Routine cardiac testing is dependent on the patient's age, type of repair, symptoms, and on-going clinical concerns. Tests include electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, Holter monitoring, exercise testing, and occasionally cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or computerized tomography.
