They provide help for antibody production by B cells, and they are also the effectors of antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI). CMI is important in the elimination of cells infected with pathogens that replicate intracellularly (eg, viruses, mycobacteria, and some bacteria) and cells exhibiting aberrant differentiation (eg, neoplasms). CMI also destroys allogeneic cells (graft rejection). In addition, it is involved in cellular autoimmune responses, as well as type IV allergic reactions to drugs and contact dermatitis. In addition, T cells activate innate immune cells such as phagocytic cells to become more effective at killing other types of pathogens such as fungi. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transplantation-immunobiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transplantation immunobiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-autoimmunity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of autoimmunity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Classification and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Type IV Reactions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-dermatitis-eczema#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of dermatitis (eczema)&quot;, section on 'Allergic contact dermatitis'</a>.)</p><p>T cell receptors (TCRs), in contrast to immunoglobulins, exist only as multimeric membrane-bound complexes and are not secreted intact in soluble form. Also unlike immunoglobulins, TCRs recognize fragments (peptides) of protein or glycoprotein antigens in complexes with major histocompatibility molecules on the surfaces of antigen-presenting cells (APCs, also called accessory cells) or on targets of cytotoxicity. Note the distinction between the processed antigen (peptide) eliciting a response and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen with which it becomes associated to stimulate peptide-specific T cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-cell-receptor-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T cell receptor genetics&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The cellular interactions that form the basis of CMI are discussed in this topic review. Related topics and T cell help for antibody production are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antigen-presenting-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antigen-presenting cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Dendritic cells (DCs) are the predominant class of &quot;professional&quot; APCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The main subtypes include plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and conventional DCs (cDCs). These are further divided into additional subtypes that have distinct surface marker expression, morphology, tissue distribution, and cytokine production and that lead to distinct pathways of T cell stimulation. <span class=\"nowrap\">Monocytes/macrophages</span> may also exert some APC activity, and monocytes may differentiate into DCs.</p><p>Only APCs constitutively express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules (which are required for activation of CD4+ T cells) and display the necessary costimulatory signals. The great majority of somatic cells express MHC class I molecules and can serve as targets of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Under certain circumstances, a variety of cell types can be induced to express MHC class II molecules. However, they do <strong>not</strong> possess costimulatory activity.</p><p>B cells express MHC class II molecules, which are required to receive T cell help (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-humoral-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The humoral immune response&quot;</a>). Although they are not competent to activate resting na&iuml;ve T cells, B cells may stimulate memory T cells. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Memory T cells'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following is a brief overview of the mechanism of antigen presentation. DCs utilize a system of receptors (pattern recognition receptors, examples being the &quot;toll-like&quot; receptors) that bind to a variety of microbial products, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide. These receptors stimulate development and migration of immature DCs in the periphery. Under the influence of cytokines and chemokines, DCs mature and migrate into the secondary lymphoid tissues where they interact with T and B cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toll-like receptors: Roles in disease and therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>DCs are highly active in processing and presenting antigen to T cells. Antigen is taken up via several means (macropinocytosis, in immune complexes via immunoglobulin G [IgG] Fc receptors, etc). It is then degraded, and peptides are loaded onto MHC class I or class II molecules. Intracellular-derived antigens (intracellular self-proteins or products of organisms that replicate intracellularly) are predominantly presented via MHC class I molecules and extracellular antigens mainly via MHC class II molecules. However, there is significant overlap in these pathways. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-histocompatibility-complex-mhc-structure-and-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) structure and function&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">T CELL ACTIVATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Structure of the T cell receptor CD3 complex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The T cell receptor (TCR) alpha-beta (TCR2) or gamma-delta (TCR1) heterodimer is noncovalently associated with the CD3 complex on the cell membrane. CD3 is comprised of four different types of subunits (gamma, delta, epsilon, and a zeta homodimer) in most cells. The gamma and delta chains of CD3 are distinct from the gamma and delta forms of the TCR itself. The CD3 complex is expressed on all T cells. The complex has a critical role in transducing a signal of TCR contact across the lymphocyte membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69555\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69555 \">figure 1</a>). The interaction of the TCR with a complementary complex of peptide plus major histocompatibility complex (peptide-MHC) forms the basis of the antigen specificity of T cell activation by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and target cell recognition in cell-mediated immunity (CMI).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">T cell accessory molecules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two coreceptor molecules, CD4 and CD8, have great importance for T cell development and for antigen recognition and activation of mature T cells (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a>). There are a host of additional cell surface molecules that play roles in T cell interactions with other cells: T cell activation by APCs, T cell regulation of other T cells and B cells, and cytotoxic T cell killing. Some of these are adhesion molecules, others are mainly transducers of activating signals, and several have both functions. Some of these T cell accessory molecules are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72603\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72603 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">T cell interactions and movements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among the variety of signals involved in T cell interactions with other cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72603\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72603 \">table 1</a>), it is uncertain in what temporal sequence these signals are all generated, nor which signals are absolutely required in a given circumstance. It is also not fully known which signals act exclusively as potentiators or inhibitors of activation. Both may be true of a particular signaling pathway, depending upon the mechanism of T cell activation.</p><p>This topic review describes the complex process of CD4+ T cell transition from the resting to the activated state.</p><p>Na&iuml;ve T cells reside in secondary lymphoid tissues, such as spleen, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches in the intestine. Naive T cells rely upon the migration of dendritic cells (DCs) into the lymphoid tissues to bring information about new immunologic events occurring in peripheral tissues into the appropriate areas. Within secondary lymphoid tissues, the na&iuml;ve T cells can &quot;scan&quot; the new information and possibly be activated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Since na&iuml;ve T cells continually recirculate through the blood, spleen, lymph, lymph nodes, and other tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], they are able to sample antigens derived from a wide range of distinct anatomical sites in search for a complementary peptide MHC complex. Following engagement of the appropriate complementary complex, a subpopulation of effector cells is activated and redirected to circulate between the blood and peripheral tissues. This permits effector T cells to reach sites of infection.</p><p>Activated T cells also migrate toward the periphery of the T cell-rich areas to facilitate contact with the B cell-rich areas. This permits interactions with antigen-specific B cells, thereby providing T cell help for antibody production. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-humoral-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The humoral immune response&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview of CD4+ T cell activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In summary, the following sequence of events takes place during activation of CD4+ T cells:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DCs capture and process antigen from peripheral sites.

This may be an important mechanism in T cell tolerance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apoptosis-and-autoimmune-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Apoptosis and autoimmune disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies of gene expression profiles have shown that anergic cells express transcripts of cytokines that are characteristic of effector T cells, although they do not produce the cytokines upon TCR engagement due to a proximal signaling block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Anergic cells do still have the potential to be converted into effector cells, although extreme stimuli may be required (eg, immunization after transfer into another host).</p><p>The manner in which costimulation converts anergy to activation is unknown. The interaction between CD28 expressed on T cells and CD80 and CD86 (B7-1 and B7-2) expressed on APCs is a very potent costimulatory system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A T cell expresses CD154 (CD40 ligand, CD40L) following activation via the TCR. CD40L binds to CD40 expressed on the APC surface and induces expression of CD80 and CD86 by the APC. Binding of these to CD28 on a resting T cell will not activate the cell, but once a T cell has been &quot;primed&quot; by antigen exposure, ligation of CD28 can trigger production of interleukin (IL)-2 and cellular proliferation. The simultaneous production of the cytokine IL-2 and a component of its high-affinity receptor (IL-2R-alpha or CD25) initiates a positive feedback loop that is important for T cell proliferation.</p><p>Inducible T cell costimulator (ICOS) is a CD28 homologue that is inducibly expressed on activated T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Interaction with ICOS ligand (ICOS-L, a B7 homologue) may augment T cell activation. However, ICOS also appears to have other roles in modulating IL-10 production by regulatory T cells (Tregs) and inhibiting development of T helper type 17 (Th17) cells. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Treg'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Th17'</a> below.)</p><p>A wide variety of additional signaling molecules expressed on T cells and APCs influence the activation or suppression and differentiation of T cells into <span class=\"nowrap\">effector/memory</span> or regulatory cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Intracellular events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All of the cell surface molecules listed in the table may play a role in T cell activation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F72603\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72603 \">table 1</a>). During intercellular contact, many of these molecules interact with cytoskeletal elements and are organized into specific regions within the zone of contact. This has been named the &quot;immunologic synapse&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69555\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69555 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>A tremendously complex cascade of events within the cytoplasm ensues upon receptor and costimulator ligation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79731\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79731 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. TCR signaling is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-cell-receptor-signaling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T cell receptor signaling&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytokine secretion profiles of activated T cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activated T cells are subdivided into distinct functional categories depending upon the profile of secreted cytokines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F101256\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101256 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The conditions under which a T cell is stimulated have great influence on the functional phenotype of the activated cell. The route by which antigens enter the body (eg, skin, gut, etc), the form of the antigen (inert molecules, living micro-organisms), and the amount of antigen are all important factors.</p><p>At the cellular level during T cell stimulation, the degree of TCR occupancy, the activity of various costimulatory pathways, and the presence of certain cytokines all influence the phenotype of activated cells. As examples, IL-12 and interferon (IFN)-gamma are the cytokines that drive T helper type 1 (Th1) cell development, while IL-4 is critical for determining T helper type 2 (Th2) development (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F101256\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101256 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>These helper T cell subpopulations are not easily distinguished with respect to surface markers. Thus, they are usually identified by their cytokine production. In general, each of these cytokine production subtypes does not amount to more than 2 to 5 percent of the T cells in circulation, usually less. These proportions are highly variable and depend upon many factors such as chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acute infection and inflammation, the genetic makeup of the individual, and modifying environmental factors. Proportions of one or more subsets may be higher in lymphoid or other tissues, again depending upon the specific tissue and ongoing immunologic processes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several subsets have been distinguished for CD4+ T cells: Th1, Th2, Th3, Th9, Th17, Th22, Treg, and follicular helper T cells (Tfh) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F101256\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101256 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These subsets are discussed briefly below and are reviewed in greater detail separately.

In comparison with na&iuml;ve T cells, memory T cells are activated more easily and rapidly in secondary immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This results from alterations in surface molecules, as well as intracellular differences in signaling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F82133\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82133 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There may be many distinct functional classes of memory T cells having different migration patterns within tissues, different properties with respect to ease of stimulation and kinetics, and requirements for maintenance. However, these issues require much additional study.</p><p>Some convenient markers of memory T cells are CD45 and the CC (two adjacent cysteines) chemokine receptor CCR7. The CD45RA isoform is expressed on na&iuml;ve T cells. The CD45RO isoform is expressed on activated or memory T cells. While CD45RA alone effectively distinguishes na&iuml;ve CD4 cells in most circumstances, it is not as useful for CD8 cells, because a significant proportion of memory CD8 cells may revert to CD45RA expression. These markers may be used as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD45RA+ (or <span class=\"nowrap\">CD45RO-)/CCR7+</span> = Na&iuml;ve T cells</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD45RA- (or <span class=\"nowrap\">CD45RO+)/CCR7+</span> = Central memory T cells</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD45RA- (or <span class=\"nowrap\">CD45RO+)/CCR7-</span> = Effector memory T cells</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD45RA+ (or <span class=\"nowrap\">CD45RO-)/CCR7-</span> = T effector memory RA-expressing cells (TEMRA).

It is of clear benefit to maintain close control over immune system activation so that there is not unnecessary exposure to its degradative potential. T cells are critical in the regulation of both humoral (antibody) and cellular effector mechanisms. Antibody responses to the vast majority of protein and glycoprotein antigens require T cell help. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) also control specific cellular cytotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

Na&iuml;ve T cells may be activated by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). They subsequently become effectors capable of activating antigen-specific B cells that display the appropriate combination of peptide plus major histocompatibility complex (peptide-MHC). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-humoral-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The humoral immune response&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Activation of APCs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The T cell-antigen-presenting cell (APC) interaction also results in an activated &quot;effector&quot; APC. This cell is then capable of elaborating higher concentrations of cytokines, increased phagocytosis, and intracellular killing, as well as the capacity to activate cytotoxic T cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Negative regulation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Autoregulation via CTLA-4</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After activation, T cells reduce expression of CD28 and increase expression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), which has higher affinity for the ligands CD80 and CD86 (B7-1 and B7-2). This leads to loss of costimulation through CD28, resulting in cessation of proliferation and cytokine production.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Inhibition via PD-1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) is an inhibitory homologue of CD28 that is expressed late after T cell activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. PD-1 interacts with the inhibitory B7 homologues programmed death ligands 1 and 2 (PD-L1 and PD-L2). Ligation of PD-1 leads to inhibition of cytokine secretion and other effector functions of T cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Activation-induced cell death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following activation, T cells expand clonally, yielding large numbers of cytokine-producing cells. These activate potent inflammatory responses to combat infection. Unchecked T cell activation could lead to malignant proliferation or autoimmune disease. One fundamental mechanism of negative regulation of T cells is therefore activation-induced cell death (AICD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The same signals that lead to activation also set in motion a program of cell death (apoptosis) that may eventually kill the cell.</p><p>Two important receptors promoting death of activated T cells are Fas (CD95, which binds Fas ligand or FasL) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 2 (TNFR2 or CD120b, which binds TNF-alpha). The interactions between these ligand pairs may occur on the same cell or between different cells. That is, the mechanism may be one of &quot;suicide&quot; or &quot;homicide.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apoptosis-and-autoimmune-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Apoptosis and autoimmune disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Suppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most T cells die within the thymus, either because they do not interact effectively with self-MHC molecules or they display reactivity against self-components (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a>). However, this process is not perfect, and some self-reactive mature T cells exit the thymus and reach the periphery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These cells must be inactivated (ie, made anergic) in order to prevent autoimmune disease. In addition, there must be a process to extinguish a protective immune response when it is no longer necessary. Mechanisms of immune suppression or regulation serve both of these functions.</p><p>Tregs are stimulated in an antigen-specific manner through the T cell receptor (TCR), but they may exert their suppressive effect specifically or nonspecifically (&quot;bystander suppression&quot;). Tregs suppress autoimmunity and downregulate responses when they are no longer needed. However, they may contribute to disease through inappropriate downregulation of protective immune responses. As an example, elevated numbers of Tregs are found in solid tumors and in the draining lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. They are also found in higher numbers in the peripheral blood of individuals with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T helper subsets: Differentiation and role in disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The T helper type 3 (Th3) subset of T cells is also a regulatory or suppressive population. They may contribute to the induction of peripheral Tregs by their production of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Another potentially regulatory or suppressive subset of T cells is called Tr1 cells. These cells produce interleukin (IL)-10 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Both Tr1 and Th3 cells are prominent in intestinal mucosa and may have roles in the induction of tolerance to ingested antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">T cell cytotoxicity</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Activation of cytotoxic T cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytotoxic T cells (cytotoxic T lymphocytes [CTLs]), the majority of which express the CD8 coreceptor for MHC class I, are also activated by professional APCs in lymphoid tissues, as are CD4-bearing cells. However, the APC must first be activated by contact with an antigen-specific CD4+ T cell before it is capable of inducing a na&iuml;ve CD8+ cell to become a full-fledged effector (cytotoxic) T cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Direct CD4+ T cell help may also be required for primary CD8+ T cell responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>As mentioned above, virtually all cells process cytoplasmic molecules and present them on their surfaces in association with MHC class I molecules. Thus, antigens derived from pathogens that replicate intracellularly are presented in this manner. Professional APCs may also present antigens internalized by phagocytosis via MHC class I molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The degree to which MHC molecules bearing antigen cluster on the cell surface appears to affect the sensitivity of T cell recognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>After acquiring effector function in lymphoid tissues, cytotoxic cells circulate in the periphery, &quot;searching&quot; for infected cells to kill. The first step in lysis is membrane contact between the cytotoxic and target cells, forming the immunologic synapse. This contact is mediated by the <span class=\"nowrap\">TCR/CD8-MHC</span> class I interaction, as well as by several T <span class=\"nowrap\">cell/target</span> cell adhesion molecule interactions (eg, CD2 with CD58, <span class=\"nowrap\">CD11a/CD18</span> with CD54CD54 and others) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Cytotoxicity occurs via two principal mechanisms: granule exocytosis and expression of the Fas ligand (FasL). Following contact with the target cell, the lytic granules within the CTL gather near the immunologic synapse (a process called &quot;polarization&quot;). The membranes of the granules fuse with the CTL membrane and release their contents directly adjacent to the target cell. CTL granules contain a variety of substances that enter the target cell and initiate apoptosis (programmed cell death). Granule contents enter the target cell through pores in the membrane created by the protein perforin, which has homology with complement factor C9. The molecules that initiate the cytotoxic process within the target cell are a family of at least 11 serine proteases called granzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although much of the biochemistry of granzymes is still unclear, some of their substrates may be precursor forms of caspases, a group of cytoplasmic enzymes that can trigger apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>CD27 is an activation marker for both T cells and B cells. It is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF7). Its ligand is CD70 (TNFSF7). All of the biologic activities of the CD27&ndash;CD70 interaction are not yet well understood. It has been established, however, that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected B cells express very high levels of CD70. The interaction of CD27 on the CTL with CD70 on EBV-infected B cells greatly enhances granule-mediated cytotoxicity by the CTL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The other principal means of cell killing involves expression of Fas ligand (FasL or CD95L) on the surface of the effector CTL. If the target cell expresses the Fas molecule (CD95), ligation by FasL on the CTL will initiate a program of apoptosis in the target cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. It is unknown precisely under what circumstances a CTL will use one mechanism or the other. Of course, FasL expression is not relevant for target cells that do not express Fas. Note that the CD27&ndash;CD70 interaction does not appear to enhance Fas&ndash;FasL mediated killing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Natural killer (NK) cells express a cytotoxicity activating molecule called NKG2D (natural killer group 2 D or killer cell lectin-like receptor, subfamily K, member 1 [KLRK1]). Two ligands for NKG2D are MHC class I-like molecules MICA (major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene A) and ULBP4 (binding protein 4 for the cytomegalovirus-encoded glycoprotein UL16). CTLs also express NKG2D, and cytotoxicity of these cells can also be promoted by interaction with MICA and ULBP4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) on the surface of EBV transformed cells can reduce expression of or interfere with the interaction of MICA and ULBP4 with NKG2D and inhibit CTL recognition of EBV transformed B cells.</p><p>In addition to these cytotoxic mechanisms, CTLs also secrete a variety of cytokines, such as interferon (IFN)-gamma and TNF that may directly damage target cells or inhibit microbial replication. They also recruit and modulate additional inflammatory effector cells, such as macrophages. Although many experiments show the importance of these cytokines for resistance to a variety of microbes, it is not always clear that CTLs are the source in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>A single CTL may &quot;recycle&quot; and lyse several target cells without itself suffering damage. It is unclear how CTLs are protected from the destructive potential of the molecules they discharge. CTLs are not themselves immune to lysis, since they may themselves be the targets of other cytotoxic cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Gamma-delta T cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T cells expressing the gamma-delta (TCR1) form of the TCR are a distinct functional class whose physiologic role is not yet understood. In normal individuals, approximately 1 to 5 percent of circulating T cells are TCR1+, the great majority of these cells are &quot;double negative&quot; (DN or CD4-CD8-) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. As in blood, the <span class=\"nowrap\">TCR1/TCR2</span> ratio is approximately 1 in 50 in secondary lymphoid tissues. However, in other locations, such as gut epithelium, the ratio is 1 in 5. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gamma-delta T cells have the capacity to interact with a variety of low-molecular-weight alkyl phosphates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Many such compounds may be found in mycobacterial cytoplasm. Alkylamines also stimulate gamma-delta T cells. The restricting elements for gamma-delta T cell antigen recognition are generally not classic MHC antigens but nonclassic MHC class I-like molecules, such as CD1, Qa, TL, or the MHC class I chain-related genes MICA and B (the latter via NKG2D) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>Although gamma-delta cells may be stimulated by dendritic cells (DCs) and other professional APCs, their ability to interact with nonclassic MHC class I molecules may permit them to respond to antigens in situ when presented by other types of cells, such as intestinal enterocytes. The requirements for costimulation for gamma-delta cell activation are not yet clear. Some gamma-delta cells express CD28, but other mechanisms may operate in CD28-negative populations.</p><p>TCR1+ T cells are expanded in a variety of infections, such as tuberculosis, leprosy, malaria, toxoplasmosis, EBV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In some murine models, this activity cannot be completely compensated by TCR2+ cells. This has not been clearly shown for humans. TCR1+ T cells are speculated to have some role in modulating or limiting inflammation initiated by TCR2+ T cells. Gamma-delta T cells do not appear to contribute to the memory T cell pool.</p><p>Gamma-delta T cells having phenotypes similar to T helper type 1 (Th1), T helper type 2 (Th2), and cytotoxic and regulatory T cells (Tregs) have all been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In some cases, these cells are CD4 or CD8 positive, indicating that they are not generally representative of TCR1+ cells. On the other hand, some are the more common DN type. Some have speculated that TCR1+ T cells are a more primitive form of cellular immunity and that they represent a &quot;first line of defense&quot; during infection. Clearly, much remains to be learned regarding the physiologic role(s) of gamma-delta T cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T cells are the effectors of antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI). CMI is important in the elimination of cells infected with pathogens that replicate intracellularly (eg, viruses, mycobacteria, and some bacteria) and cells exhibiting aberrant differentiation (eg, neoplasms). CMI also destroys allogeneic cells (graft rejection). In addition, it is involved in cellular autoimmune responses, as well as type IV allergic reactions to drugs and contact dermatitis.

(See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Cellular regulation of immune responses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) express the alpha-beta TCR heterodimer with the CD8 molecule and recognize peptide antigens in association with MHC class I.
