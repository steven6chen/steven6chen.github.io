A wide range of renal manifestations and pathologies involving different mechanisms have been described with these disorders. </p><p>This topic provides a review of the clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of kidney disease in patients with multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, etiology, treatment, and prognosis of kidney diseases associated with multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies are discussed separately.

The most common clinical findings include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute or subacute kidney injury</strong> &ndash; Approximately 20 to 50 percent of patients with multiple myeloma present with an elevated serum creatinine at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. The spectrum of kidney impairment ranges from mild injury that may be rapidly reversible (eg, volume depletion, hypercalcemia) to severe acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring hemodialysis (eg, light chain cast nephropathy). Most patients presenting with AKI have light chain cast nephropathy, although other common causes include hypercalcemia and exposure to nephrotoxic agents, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or, infrequently, radiocontrast agents. (See <a href=\"#H1903253541\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chronic kidney disease (CKD)</strong> &ndash; Some patients with multiple myeloma may experience a gradual or progressive increase in serum creatinine over a period of six months or more. These patients are less likely to have a diagnosis of light chain cast nephropathy. However, patients who have experienced one or more prior episodes of light chain cast nephropathy without complete renal recovery can develop CKD. CKD as a presenting clinical feature is more commonly seen in patients with immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis or monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD). Other factors unrelated to multiple myeloma may also contribute to CKD in patients with multiple myeloma, particularly in those with a prior history of hypertension or diabetes mellitus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-the-patient-with-newly-identified-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to the patient with newly identified chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Albuminuria or nephrotic syndrome</strong> &ndash; While many forms of kidney disease in patients with multiple myeloma can present with some degree of proteinuria, albuminuria as the principal presenting feature occurs more commonly in patients with AL amyloidosis or MIDD. These patients may also present with nephrotic syndrome. Patients with light chain cast nephropathy frequently have both AKI and proteinuria. However, the proteinuria in light chain cast nephropathy is predominantly monoclonal immunoglobulin (Bence Jones protein); in contrast, patients with AL amyloidosis or MIDD have predominantly albuminuria. In AL amyloidosis and MIDD, the urinary monoclonal light chain component is usually small. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-heavy-proteinuria-and-the-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of heavy proteinuria and the nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Electrolyte abnormalities</strong> &ndash; Hypercalcemia is the most common electrolyte abnormality in patients with multiple myeloma, occurring in more than 10 percent of patients at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Other electrolyte disorders include pseudohyponatremia and a partial or complete Fanconi syndrome. Patients with Fanconi syndrome have tubular dysfunction without significant kidney impairment. The proximal tubule is primarily affected, resulting in abnormalities such as renal tubular acidosis, hypouricemia, hypophosphatemia, aminoaciduria, renal phosphate wasting, and glycosuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The overall goal of evaluation is to determine whether a monoclonal protein is involved in the pathogenesis of the kidney disease. In most cases, a kidney biopsy is required to establish this association and to guide therapy. However, if a clinical diagnosis and treatment plan have already been established by other means (eg, diagnosis of multiple myeloma based upon bone marrow findings and lytic bone lesions, or evidence of immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis based upon biopsy of non-kidney tissues), a kidney biopsy may not be necessary. Laboratory testing of monoclonal proteins can assist with narrowing the differential diagnosis and plays an important role in monitoring the response to treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1555662590\" class=\"local\">'Tests used in the evaluation of monoclonal plasma cell disorders'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1555662590\"><span class=\"h3\">Tests used in the evaluation of monoclonal plasma cell disorders</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Serum free light chain assay </strong>&ndash; The serum free light chain (SFLC) assay quantitates the concentration of circulating kappa and lambda (unbound) free light chains (FLCs). The normal serum free kappa to lambda ratio is 0.26 to 1.65 in patients without kidney impairment and is up to 3.1 in patients with severe kidney impairment. Elevated FLCs in association with an abnormal kappa to lambda ratio typically indicates a monoclonal plasma cell proliferative process. The SFLC assay is more sensitive than the urine protein electrophoresis for detecting FLCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins#H2212928\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins&quot;, section on 'Serum free light chains'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins#H2212942\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins&quot;, section on 'Use in patients with renal insufficiency'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Light chain cast nephropathy should be strongly suspected in any patient presenting with unexplained kidney impairment over a period of less than six months and an elevated FLC level of &ge;1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span>. By contrast, light chain cast nephropathy is uncommon in patients with low (&lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span> SFLC concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1249924896\" class=\"local\">'Patients presenting with acute or subacute kidney injury'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The extent to which the SFLC ratio is abnormal may also distinguish light chain cast nephropathy from other lesions associated with myeloma. In one study, patients with light chain cast nephropathy had much higher ratios (defined as the ratio of the involved light chain to the uninvolved light chain) compared with patients with either amyloidosis or light chain deposition disease (LCDD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, the light chain ratio did not distinguish light chain cast nephropathy from patients with multiple myeloma who had acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Among patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) or subacute kidney injury, a low urine albumin excretion, particularly if it constitutes &lt;10 percent of urinary protein, is highly suggestive of light chain cast nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation</strong> &ndash; The serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation help detect intact (heavy and light chain) monoclonal immunoglobulin (ie, M-protein). It is important to recognize whether an intact immunoglobulin component is present in patients with light chain cast nephropathy for the purposes of monitoring response to therapy. In addition, some causes of kidney disease, such as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, can be caused by intact monoclonal immunoglobulin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins&quot;, section on 'Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins&quot;, section on 'Serum immunofixation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation</strong> &ndash; The 24-hour urine protein quantitation and electrophoresis provide an estimate of total protein excretion, as well as the proportion of urine protein that is albumin versus monoclonal FLCs (ie, M-protein). Thus, this test may suggest the presence of other renal diseases related to multiple myeloma, such as amyloidosis or monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD). In general, in light chain cast nephropathy, most of the urine protein will be light chains (M-protein), while in other plasma cell disorders (light chain amyloidosis or MIDD), most will be albumin while the light chain component is small. In kidney disease that is not related to plasma cell disorders, no urinary M-protein will be detected, and the proteinuria will essentially be albuminuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins&quot;, section on '24-hour urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-methods-for-analyzing-monoclonal-proteins#H33\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins&quot;, section on 'Urine immunofixation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1366256396\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications for kidney biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We obtain a kidney biopsy, unless contraindicated, in all patients with multiple myeloma or monoclonal gammopathy without a clear diagnosis for their kidney disease. Monoclonal proteins can cause kidney damage through a variety of different mechanisms and, therefore, establishing an accurate diagnosis is important to guide treatment. In addition, a kidney biopsy is the only method to confirm the association between a monoclonal protein and kidney disease. However, a kidney biopsy can be deferred in the following clinical circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with multiple myeloma who present with AKI or subacute kidney injury with a SFLC concentration &ge;1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> and a predominance of monoclonal light chains in the urine by urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation. Such patients have a presumptive diagnosis of light chain cast nephropathy.

Such patients have a presumptive diagnosis of light chain proximal tubulopathy. </p><p/><p>In the absence of a bleeding diathesis (eg, thrombocytopenia or abnormal coagulation studies) or uncontrolled hypertension, the risk of bleeding among patients with AL amyloidosis who undergo a kidney biopsy is similar to that of patients without AL amyloidosis. In one study of kidney biopsies among patients with or without systemic amyloidosis (93 percent with AL amyloidosis), there was no difference in the rate of overall or major post-biopsy bleeding complications (9.9 versus 10.6 percent and 4.0 versus 2.1 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1249924896\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients presenting with acute or subacute kidney injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute (AKI) or subacute kidney injury is a common clinical presentation of kidney disease in patients with multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies. Etiologies responsible for AKI in these patients include light chain cast nephropathy, hypercalcemia, volume depletion, nephrotoxic agents (eg, radiocontrast, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), and, less frequently, hyperuricemia or rarely hyperviscosity. Among these, light chain cast nephropathy is the most common. AKI or subacute kidney injury can also be a clinical feature of MIDD and amyloidosis, but these diseases more commonly present with proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome.

Occasionally, the kidney biopsy may reveal causes of kidney impairment that are unrelated to monoclonal gammopathy, such as ATN or interstitial nephritis. However, we do not routinely perform a kidney biopsy in patients with a bland urine sediment, a SFLC level of &ge;1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L,</span> and low urinary albumin excretion, as these patients are presumed to have a diagnosis of light chain cast nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. </p><p>Light chain cast nephropathy should also be suspected in patients who do <strong>not</strong> carry a diagnosis of multiple myeloma but have evidence of a monoclonal protein (M-protein) in the urine or an abnormal SFLC ratio. These patients should undergo additional testing to evaluate multiple myeloma, including bone marrow biopsy and bone radiographs. Once a diagnosis of multiple myeloma is established by bone marrow biopsy, the need for a kidney biopsy is determined by the degree of elevation of the SFLC concentration and by the absence or presence of clinical features that are atypical for light chain cast nephropathy (significant albuminuria and active urine sediment). Patients who have a SFLC concentration of &ge;1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> and no atypical features are presumed to have light chain cast nephropathy, and a kidney biopsy is generally not performed.

In cases in which light chain cast nephropathy is present concurrently with MIDD or amyloidosis, the clinical features and degree of kidney impairment are usually determined by the light chain cast nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].

The overall goal of the evaluation is to determine whether a monoclonal protein is involved in the pathogenesis of the kidney disease. In most cases, a kidney biopsy is required to establish this association and to guide therapy. Laboratory testing of monoclonal proteins can assist with narrowing the differential diagnosis and has an important role in monitoring the response to treatment.

Monoclonal proteins can cause kidney damage through a variety of different mechanisms, and, therefore, establishing an accurate diagnosis is important to guide treatment. In addition, a kidney biopsy is the only method to confirm the association between a monoclonal protein and kidney disease.
