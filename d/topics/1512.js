(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial assessment and management of acute stroke&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-ischemic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of ischemic stroke&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Peripheral embolization accounts for less than 10 percent of all such events and many of these are subclinical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Knowledge of the risk of stroke (and peripheral embolization) is important for two reasons: to help the patient better understand AF and its potential complications; and, more importantly, to help determine which patients might benefit from interventions to prevent thromboembolism.</p><p>Antithrombotic therapy with oral anticoagulant has been shown to lower the risk of clinical thromboembolism in virtually all patients with AF, including all levels of risk and irrespective of type (paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-fibrillation#H541379272\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'General classification'</a>.) </p><p>However, in the lowest-risk patients, the risk and impact of anticoagulant-related major bleeding may equal or exceed those of clinical thromboembolism without anticoagulant therapy. Thus, for these lowest-risk patients, clinicians need guidance regarding when to recommend such therapy. Risk prediction models have been developed for this purpose, although each has significant limitations. We prefer the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc model and will focus on it in this topic. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Options for estimating risk in the individual patient'</a> below.)</p><p>The individual predictors and the models used to predict embolic risk in patients with nonvalvular AF are discussed in this topic. The way in which the risk models are used in clinical decision making regarding antithrombotic therapy is discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical predictors'</a> above.) A 2012 retrospective cohort study of about 100,000 patients with AF (median follow-up of 1.2 years) found that the risk of ischemic stroke was modestly higher in women (6.2 versus 4.2 percent per year; multivariable hazard ratio 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.24) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In a cohort database study of 147,622 patients during 2000 through 2009, the risk of thromboembolic events was mildly increased adjusting for time-fixed covariates at entry (hazard ratio 1.16, 95% CI 1.11-1.21) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, matching on age and using a time-dependent adjustment for confounders, women were not at higher risk (rate ratio 1.01, 95% CI 0.97-1.05). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1052524220\"><span class=\"h2\">Type of AF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with AF, irrespective of type (paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent), are at increased risk of thromboembolism.

In addition, evidence is increasing that stroke risk is a function of the frequency <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the duration of AF episodes in patients with paroxysmal AF. However, for patients who do not have continuous heart rhythm monitoring, AF &quot;burden&quot; is difficult to determine. There is no strong evidence that taking duration or frequency into account improves the ability to assess stroke risk or improves care by helping select patients who do or do not benefit from anticoagulant therapy. The short-term reproducibility and long-term stability of the duration and frequency of AF are also unknown.</p><p>Few studies have evaluated the impact of duration or frequency of AF on outcomes, and specifically thromboembolic risk, in patients with paroxysmal AF. Three studies that used the continuous monitoring capability of cardiac implanted electronic devices (permanent pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, and cardiac resynchronization therapy devices) to detect AF provide some insight regarding duration (but not frequency):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prospective ASSERT study evaluated this relationship in over 2580 subjects with no history of AF who were followed for more than 2.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In a time-dependent analysis that included all episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmia detected by devices within the first three months of implantation, asymptomatic (subclinical) episodes lasting longer than six minutes, as compared with no episodes or episodes lasting less than six minutes, were associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism (hazard ratio [HR] 1.76; 95% CI, 0.99 to 3.11; p = 0.05). The increase in risk was similar when the occurrence of episodes longer than six hours was compared with the occurrence of no episodes or episodes less than six minutes (HR 2.00; 95% CI, 1.13 to 3.55). However, most of the increase in risk was seen after 17 hours.<br/><br/>A follow-up study published in 2017 reported on 2455 patients (mean follow-up of 2.5 years) with episodes &gt;six minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

However, these risk factors are dissociated in some patients, raising the possibility that TEE can be used for risk stratification. The potential utility of this approach was illustrated in the SPAF III TEE substudy of 382 clinically or TTE high-risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

However, one cannot be confident that these patients are actually at low risk and the stability of these TEE findings over time is unknown. Because of the relatively small number of patients, the 95% CI in these groups was quite wide, including 0.2 to 9.5 percent per year in the low-risk group. Adjusted-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (International Normalized Ratio 2 to 3) reduced the risk of stroke compared with low-dose warfarin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> by about 75 percent in patients with high-risk TEE features.</p><p>The LAA is well visualized with both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.

The LAA has been found to have variable shapes. In a study of 932 patients who were planning to undergo catheter ablation for drug-refractory AF, the LAA shape was characterized using one of these two imaging techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Four morphologies were described: Cactus (multiple small outpockets), Chicken Wing (smooth border), Windsock (distal accessory lobe), and Cauliflower (basal smooth border with distal multiple small outpockets); their relative frequencies were 30, 48, 19, and 3 percent, respectively. The prevalence of pre-procedure stroke or TIA was 12, 4, 10, and 18 percent, respectively, and the corresponding CHADS<sub>2</sub> scores of at least two were 19 percent, 9 percent, 16 percent, and 27 percent. After adjustment, the &ldquo;Chicken Wing&rdquo; morphology, compared to all other morphologies, had a lower risk of prior embolic event (odds ratio 0.21, 95% CI 0.05-0.91). The relationship between LAA morphology (using these imaging techniques) and the risk of embolization needs to be further evaluated in clinical prospective studies before any change in anticoagulation management is recommended based on these morphologies. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1052522978\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of thromboembolism will vary from study to study based on the characteristics of the population evaluated, the integrity of the database used to ascertain event rates, and the definition of thromboembolism. Some studies count only ischemic stroke events, while others also include transient ischemic events, pulmonary emboli, or peripheral embolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In multiple large studies of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who have not been anticoagulated, the rate of thromboembolism is about 4 to 5 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>] and rates as low as 2.1 percent have been found in other cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/13,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,45</a>]. In most studies, the rate of stroke is significantly greater than the risk of systemic embolic events (SEEs).</p><p>The incidence of SEEs was evaluated in a retrospective study of patients in four randomized trials of antithrombotic therapy (n = 39,973) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The incidence of SEEs was 0.<span class=\"nowrap\">23/100</span> person-years and the incidence of cerebral embolism was 1.<span class=\"nowrap\">92/100</span> person-years. Among those with SEEs, 58 percent occurred in the lower extremities, 31 percent in the visceral-mesenteric system, and 11 percent in the upper extremities. Clinical characteristics more prevalent in patients with SEEs were female sex, white ethnicity, history of smoking, prior myocardial infarction, prior SEE, and peripheral arterial disease.</p><p>In addition, the incidence will differ between studies depending on when counting of events starts after the diagnosis of AF (the concept of a blanking or quarantine period). For example, in a Swedish Health Registry study, the overall ischemic stroke event rate was 5.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, the annualized rate fell from 5.4 to 2.8 percent as the duration of quarantine increased from 0 to 4 weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1052524997\"><span class=\"h1\">FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS IN RISK ESTIMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the most important decisions that must be made in the care of the patient with atrial fibrillation (AF) is whether oral anticoagulation should be prescribed to reduce the risk of stroke (and other types of embolization). Since anticoagulation is associated with the risk of major bleeding, the benefit from anticoagulation is only seen when the reduction in risk of embolization exceeds the increase in risk of bleeding and its impact. Thus, the estimation of the embolic risk in the individual patient is the first step in decision making. This section of the topic will discuss how to estimate embolic risk for a given patient. The discussion of how embolic risk is used in decision making regarding the initiation of anticoagulant therapy is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization#H15581270\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;, section on 'Decide on anticoagulation'</a>.)</p><p>In individual patients (and population studies), the risk of ischemic stroke or peripheral embolization (without antithrombotic therapy) increases as the <strong>number</strong> of risk factors increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/2,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,48</a>]. Each of two risk prediction models, CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc and CHADS<sub>2</sub>, shows this relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. For example, using the CHADS<sub>2</sub> score, the range is 0.6 events per 100 person-years (equivalent to 0.6 percent per year) in patients with a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 0 compared to 13.0 events per 100 person-years with a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>However, the individual risk factors do not contribute equally (their <strong>strength </strong>differs) to the aggregate risk. For example, prior stroke and age are substantially stronger predictors than hypertension or diabetes. In addition, the incidence increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. In a study of over 6000 hospitalized (2000 to 2010) patients, the risk of stroke or thromboembolism per 100 person-years (approximately the same as percent per year) was 0.23, 2.05, and 3.99 for those aged &lt;65, 65 to 74, and &ge;75 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There is evidence that the risk of AF-related ischemic strokes has increased in patients 80 years or older. Also, the magnitude of increase in risk contributed by a history of vascular disease is likely smaller than all other CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc risk factors. Finally, the tools for estimating risk are imperfect (with a value for C statistics slightly higher than the 0.6 to 0.7 range for CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc). This imprecision is less important when the risk of embolization far exceeds the risk of major bleeding, and in particular intracranial hemorrhage, as occurs when the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score is &ge;2. In patients with a score &lt;2, additional consideration that takes into account which risk factors are present needs to be made. This process is discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H1052526135\" class=\"local\">'Our approach to risk estimation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1052525450\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION OF RISK CATEGORIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terms high-, intermediate-, and low-risk have been applied to the risk of embolization in individual patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Patients are categorized once their individual risk has been estimated. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Options for estimating risk in the individual patient'</a> below.)</p><p>A patient labelled as &ldquo;high-risk&rdquo; has an estimated risk of embolization significantly greater than the estimated risk of major bleeding, and in particular intracranial hemorrhage, with long-term anticoagulation. The risk of intracranial hemorrhage is in the range or 0.25 to 0.50 percent per year in trials of newer oral anticoagulants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/52-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-55</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-of-intracerebral-bleeding-in-patients-treated-with-anticoagulants#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk of intracerebral bleeding in patients treated with anticoagulants&quot;, section on 'ICH risk with antithrombotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Most experts agree that a 2 percent per year risk of embolization (without anticoagulation) is &ldquo;high risk.&rdquo; Some experts use a lower cut-off of 1 to 2 percent per year for high risk; others have referred to this as intermediate risk. Individuals with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score &ge;2 generally have a risk &gt;2 percent per year. </p><p>Low-risk patients are those who are not likely to derive an overall benefit from anticoagulation. These are typically individuals with a yearly rate of stroke due to AF of &lt;1 percent. Most men with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 0 and some individuals with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 1 have a rate of &lt;1 percent per year. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14631658\"><span class=\"h1\">ONE-RISK-FACTOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the risk factors are not equal in terms of the risk they contribute to the patient, there is a broad range of risk among individuals with one CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc risk factor (female sex, hypertension, age 65 to 74, heart failure, vascular disease, and diabetes mellitus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Depending on where in this range a patient falls (what risk factor is present), some patients will choose to be anticoagulated and others will not. However, for the individual patient, the difference in risk across these studies creates uncertainty in knowing a precise risk for the patient and thus makes clinical decision making regarding anticoagulation more difficult than for patients at higher or lower risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization#H15581270\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;, section on 'Decide on anticoagulation'</a>.)</p><p>Numerous studies have attempted to assess stroke risk in individuals at seemingly low risk based on the presence of only one risk factor. Some of these studies have separated the analysis by sex, as women have a higher rate of stroke than men and are given 1 point in the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score. The rate in patients with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 1 ranges from 0.6 to 2.75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/45,49,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,49,56,57</a>]. This broad range, which spans the 1 to 2 percent per year threshold for initiation of anticoagulation, results from <span class=\"nowrap\">populations/cohorts</span> with different risks, the intensity with which embolization was looked for in each study, and possibly the fact that 1-point risk factors are heterogeneous in terms of the degree of risk each imparts. </p><p>Four large analyses have focused on individuals with CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 0 or 1: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An 2015 analysis of 140,420 AF patients in the Swedish nationwide health registries focused on individuals with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The annual event rates varied between 0.5 and 0.9 percent, depending on whether only ischemic strokes were counted or a more inclusive end point was used. The annual ischemic stroke rate was 0.1 to 0.2 percent for women (their CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 1 was derived from their sex).

These models incorporate some or all of the clinical (and rarely imaging) risk predictors discussed above.

We prefer the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score to other models, as we feel it improves predictive ability in lower-risk patients and may recategorize some patients into a risk group for which we recommend anticoagulation. However, it should be kept in mind that all of the risk models are at best only moderately able to predict risk and antithrombotic is associated with reduced stroke risk for all levels of risk (which have been adequately studied). (See <a href=\"#H755604012\" class=\"local\">'Comparison of models'</a> below.)</p><p>These models assign patients to a numerical risk category based on the number of risk factors present. As the number increases (becomes higher), so does the risk of stroke (and the greater the benefit from anticoagulant therapy). In addition, some of the models group these risk categories further into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups For the most part, we have avoided using this approach, as we don&rsquo;t feel it helps in the management of the individual patient. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H755604006\"><span class=\"h2\">Individual stroke risk scores</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The multivariate models have used the clinical parameters presented in the section above but have not generally included echocardiographic predictors, with the exception of left ventricular systolic function.

The risk at the higher end of the CHADS<sub>2 </sub>= 0 range may be attributable to individuals with increased age (eg, 74 years as opposed to 54 years), female sex, and possibly arterial vascular disease, all of which are risk factors included in the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization/abstract/46,49,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,49,66</a>].
