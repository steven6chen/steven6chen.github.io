Although detailed knowledge of the elements of the network is important for distinguishing between radiculopathy and mononeuropathy, a syndromic approach is more useful for diagnosing lesions involving the plexus itself.</p><p>This topic will briefly review the underlying anatomy, pathogenesis, and general clinical features of brachial plexopathies, and then discuss a number of specific brachial plexopathies, classified for convenience by clinical setting into traumatic, nontraumatic, iatrogenic, and neonatal types.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nerve roots from C5 through T1 contribute to the brachial plexus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50576\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50576 \">figure 1</a>). The plexus can be divided into regions that include (from proximal to distal) trunks, divisions, cords, branches, and nerves. Trunks and divisions are further subdivided with a nomenclature based on overall relationships with other upper extremity anatomic structures and include upper, lower, and middle trunks, and posterior, lateral, and medial cords.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C5 and C6 roots merge to form the upper trunk. The C7 root forms the middle trunk. C8 and T1 roots merge to form the lower trunk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The upper trunk divides and gives branches to the lateral and posterior cords. The middle trunk divides and gives branches to the lateral and posterior cords. The lower trunk divides and gives branches to the posterior and medial cord.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lateral cord branches and gives rise to the musculocutaneous nerve and contributes to the median nerve. The posterior cord branches and gives rise to the axillary nerve and then becomes the radial nerve. The medial cord branches and contributes to the median nerve and then becomes the ulnar nerve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other nerves arise from various elements of the plexus. The dorsal scapular nerve arises from the C5 root. The long thoracic nerve arises from C5, C6, and C7 roots. The suprascapular nerve arises from the upper trunk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contributions to motor and sensory function vary within the brachial plexus. The largest percentages of motor fibers are from C5 and C6 roots, and the least from C7 and T1 roots. The greatest number of sensory fibers is from the C7 root, with lesser amounts from C5, C6, C8, and T1 roots [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Postganglionic sympathetic nerve fibers from vertebral ganglia course through the brachial plexus.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathologic basis and histologic changes seen with brachial plexus lesions vary with the underlying cause, which include compression, transection, ischemia, inflammation, metabolic abnormalities, neoplasia, and radiation therapy. Because the brachial plexus is relatively inaccessible to direct investigation, most pathologic processes are deduced.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve compression is relatively uncommon because the brachial plexus is protected by bony structures. Contact sports are the most frequent cause of nerve compression injury to the brachial plexus; focal forces to the shoulder region result in brief compression of underlying plexus elements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overt nerve transection occurs with major trauma to the neck and shoulder, causing downward traction on the shoulder and movement of the neck to the contralateral side, or with trauma to the arm, causing upward traction on the arm and shoulder. High-force traction to the plexus may also be associated with avulsion of nerve roots.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemia due to occlusion of small intraneural (vasa nervorum) vessels is more common than ischemia due to occlusion of large vessels. Small vessel ischemia may be a common pathologic basis for inflammatory, metabolic, and radiation-induced plexopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Ischemia causes localized axonal damage, resulting in denervation of muscle and skin receptors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammation, perhaps leading to small vessel occlusion, is hypothesized to cause brachial plexopathies of acute onset (excluding those associated with mechanical causes). However, precipitating events for such an inflammatory response and its consequences are poorly understood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic abnormalities are the most likely initiating factors underlying plexopathies related to diabetes mellitus. That said, the specific factors are not known and the pathophysiology may include inflammation and focal ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neoplastic plexopathies can result from direct pressure by a local cancer mass, but invasion by cancer cells along nerves or tracking along connective tissue is more common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation treatment for cancer is a common cause of damage to brachial plexus nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The toxic effects of radiation may injure axons directly or injure the vasa nervorum causing ischemic changes to axons with multifocal denervation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brachial plexus syndromes are rare, as illustrated by the prevalence of plexopathies associated with cancer (approximately 0.4 percent of patients with cancer) and those associated with radiation treatment (approximately 2 to 5 percent of those treated) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Idiopathic brachial plexopathy, or brachial amyotrophy, has an estimated annual incidence of 2 to 3 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In one large series, the male to female ratio was 2:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of symptoms from brachial plexopathies may vary from acute to insidious. Acute onset is usually characterized by pain in the shoulder or upper arm, while insidious onset can manifest as progressive pain, evolving numbness, weakness of selected muscles, or any combination. Early on, distinguishing between symptoms arising from bones and ligaments about the shoulder and those from nerves in the plexus may be difficult. Acute onset, in the absence of trauma, favors a metabolic or inflammatory process. Chronic progression of symptoms in patients with a history of cancer and radiation treatment suggests either as a cause.</p><p>Clinical signs of brachial plexopathy include muscle weakness, atrophy, and sensory loss. With a painful plexopathy of acute onset it may be difficult to distinguish true weakness from reduced effort due to pain. Muscle atrophy may not be appreciated for several weeks. Tendon reflexes may be reduced in weak muscles. Sensory loss commonly involves the axillary nerve distribution, but may be diffuse or reflect the distributions of other involved nerves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F75388\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75388 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary pathologic lesion in most plexopathies is axonal loss, with demyelination and conduction block as secondary processes. Nerve conduction studies primarily assess terminal segments of nerves, and the distribution of abnormalities can be helpful in localizing lesion sites lying more proximally in the plexus. They can also determine if there are alternative diagnoses, such as nerve entrapment syndromes. Sensory nerve conduction studies are more sensitive to axonal loss than motor nerve studies, and application of a battery of sensory nerve tests can be diagnostically helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Needle electromyography is the most sensitive test of axonal damage in motor nerves and can further localize the lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, essentially any muscle can be studied with needle electromyography, and thus any element of the plexus can be assessed. However, abnormal spontaneous activity in the form of positive waves and fibrillation potentials may not be apparent for three weeks after the acute onset of plexopathies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine chest and spine films may reveal osseous injuries or altered posture due to muscle weakness. Plain CT is useful for detecting bony abnormalities, and CT myelography is useful for detecting root avulsions. MRI is more sensitive for structural abnormalities than CT.</p><p>Magnetic resonance neurography is a specialized procedure that can visualize individual roots, segments of the plexus, and peripheral nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. It has low specificity but is more sensitive than conventional MRI for plexus lesions, and can identify local factors relevant to possible demyelination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> compression, including nerve edema, thickening, and T2 hyperintensities.</p><p>Ultrasound has been used to image the brachial plexus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and may be able to distinguish preganglionic from postganglionic traumatic lesions noninvasively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TRAUMATIC PLEXOPATHIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traumatic injuries are the most common cause of brachial plexus lesions in children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Motor vehicle accidents (particularly involving motorcycle riders), industrial accidents, falls, objects falling on a shoulder, sports injuries, and prolonged pressure on the plexus during deep sleep are among the many causes of closed brachial plexus trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Open traumatic brachial plexus injuries result from gunshot wounds, lacerations, and animal bites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Open injuries are frequently associated with trauma to nearby blood vessels, with the result that the plexus suffers secondary injury from expanding hematomas, pseudoaneurysms, and arteriovenous fistulas.</p><p>In the setting of closed or open traumatic brachial plexus injuries caused by acute trauma, it is important to evaluate the patient for concomitant head injuries, bone fractures, dislocations, rotator cuff tears, and vascular disruptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].

Thus, traumatic injuries may include a combination of plexopathy and root avulsions. The torn nerve roots and axons are incapable of regeneration and are not amenable to surgical repair. Thus, the resulting motor and sensory deficits are permanent. Multiple root avulsions are frequent with traumatic injury, resulting in extensive deficits. In addition, most patients develop severe avulsion pain, often involving the hand.</p><p>The lowest two brachial plexus roots (C8 and T1) are the most susceptible to root avulsion, while the upper two (C5 and C6) are more susceptible to extraforaminal rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Unlike root avulsions, extraforaminal nerve ruptures may be accessible to surgical repair.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Burner syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The burner syndrome (also called the stinger syndrome) is a term that describes the transient burning and stinging sensations experienced during contact sports due to forceful contact by a helmet to the neck or anterior shoulder region. This type of athletic injury causes transient dysfunction of the brachial plexus and occasionally the spinal cord. The upper trunk is most commonly involved, due to downward traction of the shoulder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=burners-stingers-acute-brachial-plexus-injury-in-the-athlete#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Burners (stingers): Acute brachial plexus injury in the athlete&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms are usually transient with no nerve damage. However, some cases are associated with denervation, with or without weakness. Some clinicians use the term burner to indicate more severe episodes of numbness in limbs that implicate damage to the spinal cord. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=burners-stingers-acute-brachial-plexus-injury-in-the-athlete#H603285608\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Burners (stingers): Acute brachial plexus injury in the athlete&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of burner syndrome is straightforward in the context of American football or other contact sports. There may be a degree of weakness that raises the question of a more substantial injury. Needle electromyography is usually normal, but can detect mild degrees of denervation when there is no weakness, and more marked changes when there is weakness. However, electromyography is only indicated if symptoms persist for more than three weeks, since the effects of acute injury are not evident prior to this time. The physical examination should include assessment for a myelopathy if symptoms suggest spinal cord damage, and when there is a concern, an imaging study of the cervical spine is appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=burners-stingers-acute-brachial-plexus-injury-in-the-athlete#H603285295\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Burners (stingers): Acute brachial plexus injury in the athlete&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Since most burners and stingers are transient, lasting minutes to hours, no work-up or treatment is usually required. Those associated with weakness typically improve without treatment, but refraining from football and other contact sports is appropriate until strength is regained. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=burners-stingers-acute-brachial-plexus-injury-in-the-athlete#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Burners (stingers): Acute brachial plexus injury in the athlete&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Backpack palsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Backpack palsy (also known as rucksack paralysis and cadet palsy) is an upper plexus disorder. Patients with this condition present with painless arm <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> shoulder weakness, usually unilateral, after wearing a backpack or similar apparatus (eg, child carrying harness) for a prolonged period of time, resulting most often in an upper trunk lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Some sensory loss is also present in the same distribution.</p><p>The pathogenesis of backpack palsy is thought to be direct compression from the weight of the backpack. The lesions are predominantly demyelinating conduction block, and full recovery usually ensues over a few months. In a minority, axon loss predominates, and recovery may be incomplete or slow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60765533\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis and treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of traumatic brachial plexopathies, whether from forceful trauma or iatrogenic trauma, is difficult to document but is generally poor, with most natural improvements occurring within six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, there are few published data regarding the outcome of unoperated traumatic plexopathies.</p><p>Most surgical interventions are performed after documenting no improvement over three to four months, although there situations when emergent intervention is appropriate. They type of surgical intervention is dependent upon the nature and degree of the lesion, and includes neurolysis, nerve grafts, nerve transfers, and tendon and muscle transfers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. There are data suggesting that delaying surgical treatment for longer than two to six months diminishes the chance for an improved level of function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. Injuries that have a degree of axonal continuity may have a more favorable outcome, and nerve grafts are most successful for injuries of C5, C6, and C7 roots; upper and middle trunks; and lateral and posterior cords [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Outcome may be partially dependent upon surgical experience with brachial plexus injuries, and data from experienced centers supports improved function in approximately 60 percent after surgical interventions. However, many patients remain disabled, with one survey finding that one-half of those previously employed did not return to work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In a case report, three patients with a traumatic global brachial plexus injury regained some useful hand function 2 to 17 years after the injury with a novel bionic reconstruction technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This technique involves a combination of selective nerve and muscle transfers, elective amputation of the nonfunctional hand, reconstruction with a prosthetic hand, and cognitive rehabilitation to activate muscles attached to the prosthetic hand. More data are needed to determine whether there is sufficient benefit to warrant this heroic procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">NONTRAUMATIC PLEXOPATHIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nontraumatic brachial plexopathies include neuralgic amyotrophy, hereditary brachial plexopathy, neoplastic and radiation induced plexopathy, thoracic outlet syndrome, and brachial plexopathy related to diabetes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuralgic amyotrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuralgic amyotrophy is considered to be an inflammatory disorder of the brachial plexus. It is known by a number of terms, including Parsonage-Turner syndrome, paralytic brachial neuritis, idiopathic brachial plexopathy, brachial plexus neuropathy, and acute brachial radiculitis. It has been described in children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The pathology for all forms of idiopathic brachial plexopathy is speculative, as most cases are neither biopsied nor come to autopsy. However, careful clinical and electrophysiologic assessment suggests that neuralgic amyotrophy is a multifocal rather than a global process, with motor nerves seeming more vulnerable than sensory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Hypothesized underlying causes focus on immune-mediated processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In this regard, approximately 50 percent of patients describe some type of antecedent event or possible predisposing condition, such as infection, exercise, surgery, pregnancy and puerperium, or vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Classic form</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In its classic form, neuralgic amyotrophy is characterized clinically by the onset of severe pain followed by patchy weakness in the distribution of the upper <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> middle brachial plexus, usually involving winging of the scapula. There is rapid or subacute onset of unilateral shoulder girdle and lateral arm pain, often awakening the individual in the night. The pain can be excruciating and may last up to four weeks before subsiding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Bilateral onset of pain has been reported in up to in 29 percent of patients, almost always with asymmetric involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Sensory symptoms occur in a majority of patients, most commonly manifesting as hypesthesia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> paresthesia, and usually involving the lateral shoulder and arm <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the hand.</p><p>The time to onset of weakness is highly variable, as illustrated by the finding that weakness occurs within the first 24 hours after onset of pain in one-third of patients, and more than two weeks after onset of pain in approximately one-quarter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The distribution of muscle atrophy and weakness may be limited to muscles supplied by one nerve, or in extreme cases may involve all muscles of the shoulder or arm. There is a predilection for muscles innervated by the suprascapular, long thoracic, musculocutaneous, radial, anterior interosseous, and axillary nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/7,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,33</a>]. Variable weakness may also be present in the contralateral limb. Recovery of strength begins within several months, and the maximal degree of recovery may not be achieved for several years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical variability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is worth emphasizing that the pattern of nerve involvement observed in neuralgic amyotrophy can be more diverse than the classic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Any part of the brachial plexus or muscles it innervates may be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In very severe cases, there may be bilateral arm paralysis. Other patients may have involvement of single or multiple nerves in the limb, more akin to a mononeuritis or mononeuritis multiplex. Individual limb nerves that may be affected include long thoracic, anterior interosseous, radial, median, and a variety of cutaneous nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. As an example, isolated anterior interosseous nerve involvement may be the only motor manifestation in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In a minority of patients, attacks may involve nerves outside of the brachial plexus, including the lumbosacral plexus, phrenic nerve, and recurrent laryngeal nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>].</p><p>A similar clinical disorder occurs in association with a variety of surgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Onset is heralded by shoulder girdle pain 1 to 14 days after surgery, so that direct nerve traction and compression are not likely causative factors. Weakness ensues within several days, and has similar distributions to that seen in idiopathic brachial plexopathy. Electrodiagnostic studies support axonal loss. Recovery is good.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuralgic amyotrophy is primarily a clinical diagnosis supported by electrodiagnostic testing. Clinical suspicion is based upon the pattern of initial sudden and severe pain followed by atrophic weakness with slow recovery. Nerve conduction studies are supportive and can exclude more common mononeuropathies, while needle electromyography (EMG) is important to document denervation. The pattern of denervation supports either specific nerve involvement or a more patchy distribution. Laboratory studies are normal, and imaging studies are often unrevealing. MRI and magnetic resonance neurography of the brachial plexus and affected nerves may show abnormalities including focal thickening, increased T2 signal, and gadolinium enhancement, but sensitivity appears to be low, particularly in the acute phase of neuralgic amyotrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/7,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,36-38</a>].

Genetic studies in families with this condition identified mutations in the septin 9 gene (SEPT9) on chromosome 17q25 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. Hereditary brachial plexopathy is distinct from hereditary neuropathy with predisposition to pressure palsies (HNPP), a recurrent demyelinating neuropathy that can involve the brachial plexus.

Many patients exhibit a relapsing-remitting course characterized by attacks that resolve spontaneously, either completely or incompletely, leaving additive residual weakness. Reported triggering events include physical exertion, anesthesia, surgery, pregnancy, and childbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>The disorder can also follow a progressive pattern. In one study that analyzed 101 attacks in 24 patients from nine different families, both a classic relapsing-remitting type and a chronic undulating type with exacerbations were observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Only one type occurred per family.</p><p>Attacks are heralded by pain and paresthesias, followed by paresis of the shoulder and arm. While any nerve in the brachial plexus can be involved, injury to the upper part of the brachial plexus is most frequent. Winging of the scapula caused by long thoracic nerve involvement is common, and facial weakness and autonomic nervous system dysfunction may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Sympathetic activity with flushing can be observed.

Nerves outside the brachial plexus can also be involved, including the lumbosacral plexus, the phrenic nerve (causing weakness of the diaphragm), and the recurrent laryngeal nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Characteristic somatic features of hereditary brachial plexopathy include short stature, hypotelorism, a small face, unusual skin folds, and creases on the neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Although electrophysiologic studies are limited, sensory nerve conduction velocity is typically normal, while motor conduction latencies are prolonged.

Muscle demonstrates pathologic changes consistent with neurogenic atrophy. Both motor and sensory nerves show widely dispersed pathologic involvement throughout the brachial plexus; the changes involve very focal damage to individual nerves with lesions restricted to isolated fascicles within the nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Pain in the shoulder and axilla is the most common presenting symptom of neoplastic brachial plexopathy. Invasion of the lower plexus (inferior trunk and medial cord) occurs more frequently than invasion of the upper trunk.

In general, compared with radiation-induced brachial plexopathies, neoplastic plexopathies are more likely to produce pain at symptom onset, more often involve the lower plexus, and are more frequently associated with a Horner's syndrome.</p><p>Primary brachial plexus tumors, such as schwannomas or neurofibromas, are uncommon, and most occur as solitary tumors. These rarely cause symptomatic plexopathies. However, multiple tumors occur in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, and these are more likely than solitary tumors to present with pain or clinical deficits.</p><p>The diagnosis of neoplastic brachial plexopathy is suggested by the clinical setting, including symptoms, past medical history (eg, smoking), and physical examination, particularly the breast examination. Imaging of the chest by x-ray and CT or MRI is most useful to detect a pulmonary tumor. A Horner syndrome in the setting of shoulder pain and weakness is strongly supportive of a pulmonary tumor. Electrodiagnostic studies are useful to define the location of the tumor in the brachial plexus.</p><p>There are limited data on the benefit of treating neoplastic brachial plexopathy with radiation therapy to the plexus; the goal is mostly directed at reducing pain. Medical management of pain is appropriate if radiation therapy is not beneficial.

As mentioned above, either cancer recurrence or radiation therapy can cause a brachial plexopathy in this setting. </p><p>Lung and breast cancers are the most common neoplasms that are treated with radiation therapy in the vicinity of the brachial plexus, but any patient with radiation therapy to the region is at risk for subsequent plexopathy. Nevertheless, brachial plexopathy is most frequently seen in women with early stage breast cancer, who have been treated with conservative surgery and radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>].

In addition, the degree of paresthesia and weakness typically are more severe with radiation-induced plexopathy than with neoplastic brachial plexopathy. Survival in the setting of radiation-induced plexopathy is related to the underlying cancer and is good with respect to the side effects of radiation.</p><p>The diagnosis of a radiation-induced rather than neoplastic plexopathy is supported by the presence of fasciculations on electrodiagnostic testing. Myokymic discharges add further support to the diagnosis, since these are rarely found in other conditions.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-thoracic-outlet-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of thoracic outlet syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>True neurogenic TOS is rare, with an estimated incidence of 1:1,000,000, and occurs most commonly in women, with a female to male ratio of 9:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Symptoms of true TOS include slowly progressive unilateral atrophic weakness of intrinsic hand muscles and numbness in the distribution of the ulnar nerve, with occasional numbness of the ulnar aspect of the forearm. The motor involvement is much greater than the sensory involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Weakness and atrophy involve the thenar eminence (median-innervated hand intrinsic muscles) more than the ulnar-innervated hand intrinsic muscles, while medial forearm muscles are less involved. The syndrome may be caused by a taut congenital fibrous band from the first rib to the tip of an elongated C7 transverse process or to a rudimentary cervical rib. The lower portion of the plexus is stretched over this band, and chronic traction injury results. This explains why true TOS has the clinical features of a lower trunk plexopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Other potential causes of TOS include hypertrophy of the scalene, subclavius, or pectoralis minor muscles, as might be seen in weight lifters or other kinds of athletes.

Arterial and venous forms of TOS are caused by compression of the subclavian artery or vein. Patients may present with arm ischemia (claudication <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acute embolic events) or venous thrombosis.

Puncture of the axillary or brachial artery during procedures such as arteriography or axillary regional anesthetic blocks can produce an expanding hematoma that causes a compartment syndrome and compresses one or more of the terminal nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/8,14,71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14,71-73</a>]. The median and ulnar nerves are most frequently affected.</p><p>Initial symptoms of the medial brachial fascial compartment syndrome may be delayed for two weeks or longer after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brachial-plexus-syndromes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Unilateral pain and paresthesia are followed by progressive weakness. Distal pulses typically remain normal.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-brachial-plexus-palsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal brachial plexus palsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The etiology of NBPP has been attributed to iatrogenic lateral traction on the fetal head, typically when shoulder dystocia impedes delivery. However, NBPP can occur even when axial traction is properly applied; the occurrence of NBPP following birth does not automatically indicate that the practitioner applied forces or maneuvers that caused the nerve injury. Many cases of brachial plexus injury are not due to shoulder dystocia or excessive force by the provider. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-brachial-plexus-palsy#H774209249\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal brachial plexus palsy&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>NBPP is uncommon. The only established risk factor is shoulder dystocia. There are no proven measures that can predict or prevent NBPP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-brachial-plexus-palsy#H175843968\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal brachial plexus palsy&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>In practice, NBPP can be divided into the common upper brachial plexus palsy involving injury to C5, C6, and occasionally C7 (Erb palsy) and the less common total brachial plexus palsy involving all the roots from C5 to T1. Upper palsy due to C5 and C6 injury manifests as adduction and internal rotation of the arm, and forearm extension, while hand and wrist movement are preserved. When C7 is additionally involved in upper palsy, there is also flexion of the wrists and fingers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67537\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67537 \">picture 1</a>). Total brachial plexus palsy presents with arm paralysis, sometimes accompanied by a Horner syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-brachial-plexus-palsy#H175844102\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal brachial plexus palsy&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of NBPP is made clinically when arm weakness at birth fits a distribution consistent with a brachial plexus injury. In many cases, the diagnosis is straightforward. Adjuncts that may be useful for therapeutic decisions about the need for surgical nerve repair or reconstruction include electrodiagnostic studies and imaging. Because of the potential impact on prognosis and medicolegal issues, practitioners should try to determine the time when the brachial plexus injury occurred. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-brachial-plexus-palsy#H175844102\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal brachial plexus palsy&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Management of NBPP is controversial. A period of physical therapy and observation for evidence of recovery is often employed. Surgical intervention is advocated in select cases if functional recovery does not ensue in three to nine months, but there is no consensus regarding the utility or timing of surgery. Early referral to a center with expertise in the management of NBPP may improve outcomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-brachial-plexus-palsy#H175844034\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal brachial plexus palsy&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29078490\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nerve roots from C5 through T1 contribute to the brachial plexus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50576\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50576 \">figure 1</a>). The plexus can be divided into regions that include (from proximal to distal) trunks, divisions, cords, branches, and nerves. Trunks and divisions are further subdivided with a nomenclature based on overall relationships with other upper extremity anatomic structures and include upper, lower, and middle trunks, and posterior and anterior cords. The pathologic basis and histologic changes seen with brachial plexus lesions vary with the underlying cause, which include compression, transection, ischemia, inflammation, metabolic abnormalities, neoplasia, and radiation therapy. Because the brachial plexus is relatively inaccessible to direct investigation, most pathologic processes are deduced. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The onset of symptoms from brachial plexopathies may vary from acute to insidious. Acute onset is usually characterized by pain in the shoulder or upper arm, while insidious onset can manifest as progressive pain, evolving numbness, weakness of selected muscles, or any combination. Acute onset, in the absence of trauma, favors a metabolic or inflammatory process. Chronic progression of symptoms in patients with a history of cancer and radiation treatment suggests either as a cause. Clinical signs include muscle weakness, atrophy, and sensory loss. Muscle atrophy may not be appreciated for several weeks. The primary pathologic lesion in most plexopathies is axonal loss, with demyelination and conduction block as secondary processes. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms and signs'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traumatic injuries are the most common cause of brachial plexus lesions in children and adults. Motor vehicle accidents, industrial accidents, falls, objects falling on a shoulder, and sports injuries are among the many causes of closed brachial plexus trauma. Open traumatic brachial plexus injuries result from gunshot wounds, lacerations, and animal bites. Open injuries are frequently associated with secondary injury from expanding hematomas, pseudoaneurysms, and arteriovenous fistulas. Root avulsions, the burner syndrome, and backpack palsy are discussed in greater detail. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Traumatic plexopathies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nontraumatic brachial plexopathies include neuralgic amyotrophy, hereditary brachial plexopathy, neoplastic and radiation induced plexopathy, thoracic outlet syndrome, and brachial plexopathy related to diabetes. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Nontraumatic plexopathies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In its classic form, neuralgic amyotrophy is characterized clinically by the onset of severe pain followed by patchy weakness in the distribution of the upper <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> middle brachial plexus, usually involving winging of the scapula. The time to onset of weakness is highly variable. Sensory symptoms occur in a majority of patients, most commonly manifesting as hypesthesia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> paresthesia, and usually involving the lateral shoulder and arm <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the hand. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Neuralgic amyotrophy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hereditary brachial plexopathy is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent, painful brachial plexopathies. In some families the cause has been identified as mutations in the SEPT9 gene. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Hereditary brachial plexopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast and lung cancers are the most frequent neoplasms leading to brachial plexopathy. Pain in the shoulder and axilla is the most common presenting symptom of neoplastic brachial plexopathy. Invasion of the lower plexus (inferior trunk and medial cord) occurs more frequently than invasion of the upper trunk. Radiation-induced brachial plexopathy is a consideration in patients with cancer who develop plexopathy after radiation therapy in the vicinity of the brachial plexus. Either cancer recurrence or radiation therapy can cause a brachial plexopathy in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Neoplastic and radiation-induced brachial plexopathy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cancer pain syndromes&quot;, section on 'Plexopathies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a term used to denote a variety of upper extremity syndromes, with only a small number having a neurologic basis. TOS is generally divided into true neurogenic TOS, vascular TOS (with arterial vascular and venous vascular subtypes), and disputed (nonspecific) TOS. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Thoracic outlet syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plexopathies related to diabetes mellitus usually involve the lumbosacral plexus, but upper extremity involvement has also been observed as part of the syndrome. In contemporary series, upper extremity involvement occurs in up to one-third of patients and may be in the form of mononeuropathies of the ulnar and median nerves, or at more proximal sites in the brachial plexus. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Diabetic-related brachial plexopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iatrogenic brachial plexopathies related to surgery and other medical procedures account for approximately 7 to 10 percent of all brachial plexopathies. Examples include classic postoperative paralysis, postmedian sternotomy plexopathy, and medial fascial compartment syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Iatrogenic plexopathies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal brachial plexus palsy (NBPP) is uncommon.
