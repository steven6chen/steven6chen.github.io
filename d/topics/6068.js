They are usually found incidentally during endoscopy or routine imaging with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> contrast radiography, magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography. The differential diagnosis includes a number of benign and malignant nonepithelial tumors, intramural vessels, and extrinsic compression from extramural structures.</p><p>Endoscopy alone cannot accurately distinguish between intramural and extramural lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-for-the-characterization-of-subepithelial-lesions-of-the-upper-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. By contrast, endoscopic ultrasonography can characterize such masses by identifying the layer of origin and guiding tissue acquisition for studies that include cytohistology, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry. The pathology combined with lesion size, location, and sonographic morphology can help distinguish between benign (the majority of subepithelial lesions) and malignant or premalignant lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73389\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73389 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of the most common subepithelial lesions that can be identified endosonographically.

Extramural lesions may be a normal adjacent structure (eg, spleen, aorta, gallbladder) or pathologic structures (eg, splenic artery aneurysm, cyst, tumor). Rarely, the distinction between an intra- and extramural lesion may be difficult when there is invasion into the GI wall.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It can determine the originating layer of intramural lesions, an important clue for making a diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73389\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73389 \">algorithm 1</a>). Stromal cell tumors, for example, can typically be seen as evolving from the muscularis propria or muscularis mucosa, whereas lipomas typically evolve from the submucosa. Determining the layer of origin will have a significant impact on management (surgical, endoscopic, or no treatment) and the endoscopic approach.

Water instillation may be helpful to provide adequate acoustic coupling while achieving a focal distance that permits optimal imaging. The focal length for a 7.5 MHz transducer is approximately 2 cm. Imaging can be optimized by using a minimally-inflated, water-filled balloon and instilling deaerated water to distend the lumen while providing a medium to transmit the ultrasound waves without reflection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For small (&lt;1 cm) or flat lesions, imaging with through&ndash;the-scope, high-frequency catheter ultrasound probes (&quot;miniprobes&quot;) may be technically easier than using a dedicated echoendoscope. Miniprobes are approximately 3 mm in diameter and operate at 12, 15, 20, and 30 MHz frequencies, permitting more detailed imaging of the GI wall compared with the lower-frequency standard echoendoscopes. However, they have relatively shallow depth of penetration, limiting visualization of large tumors and surrounding lymph nodes. The miniprobes can be introduced through the working channel of a diagnostic endoscope and directed to the lesion endoscopically. A balloon sheath can be used to optimize acoustic coupling, although it increases the diameter of the probe, requiring use of a therapeutic endoscope.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Description of the lesion's characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary characteristics that should be determined include the layer of origin or extramural origin, size, echogenicity, and vascularity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73389\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73389 \">algorithm 1</a>). Echogenicity has been described as the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anechoic &ndash; The echogenicity of water or clear fluid (ie, black with no internal echoes). Anechoic lesions are typically associated with acoustic enhancement, which is a brighter echo located behind a fluid-filled structure. Common examples are cysts, vessels, and the gallbladder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoechoic &ndash; Echogenicity that is equivalent or lower than that of the second (lamina propria) and fourth wall layers (muscularis propria).

In one study, jumbo biopsies using the bite-on-bite technique in 22 subepithelial lesions was found to be diagnostic in 18 of 22 cases; however, another study of jumbo biopsies from submucosal lesions found the diagnostic yield to be only 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-for-the-characterization-of-subepithelial-lesions-of-the-upper-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A retrospective study compared jumbo biopsies and EUS-guided FNA (average lesion size 15 mm <span class=\"nowrap\">+/-</span> 9.3 mm, location primarily in the upper GI tract) and were similar with regard to making a definitive diagnosis (59 versus 45 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-for-the-characterization-of-subepithelial-lesions-of-the-upper-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, significant bleeding requiring hemostasis occurred in nearly 35 percent of patients undergoing jumbo forceps biopsy.

This technique has been referred to as &quot;SINK&quot; or &quot;unroofing.&quot; Various approaches are used to facilitate SINK, including the use of a double-channel endoscope, band ligation, and a cap attachment. A prospective study comparing biopsy and SINK techniques showed a marked increase in diagnostic yield between the two modalities (17 versus 87 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-for-the-characterization-of-subepithelial-lesions-of-the-upper-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

This can be performed using standard or over-the-scope clips, endoscopic suturing, and endoloops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-for-the-characterization-of-subepithelial-lesions-of-the-upper-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Submucosal &quot;tunneling&quot;</strong> &mdash; Tunneling may improve the safety of tissue acquisition and endoscopic resection of subepithelial tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-for-the-characterization-of-subepithelial-lesions-of-the-upper-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. The technique involves performing a mucosal incision proximal to the lesion, followed by scope advancement into the submucosal space, and dissection in the submucosa up to the lesion. Enucleation of the lesion can be performed with ESD techniques and the lesion retrieved through the tunnel. Mucosal closure of the tunnel is then performed.

The differential diagnosis includes a multitude of lesions that can occupy the submucosal layers. These include leiomyomas, leiomyosarcomas, schwannomas, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors in children, lipomas, liposarcomas, metastatic tumors, and desmoid tumors. Distinction from these other tumors is made based upon clinical, histological, and molecular features.</p><p>A distinguishing molecular feature of GISTs is that they are positive for c-kit (a stem cell factor receptor referred to as CD117) in the majority of patients. This immunohistochemical stain distinguishes GIST from other kinds of spindle cell tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-for-the-characterization-of-subepithelial-lesions-of-the-upper-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Other tumors that are positive for c-kit (such as angiosarcomas and metastatic melanomas) can usually be distinguished based upon clinical and histologic features. Additional markers found in GISTs include CD34 (a hematopoietic cell progenitor cell antigen present in approximately 70 percent), smooth muscle actin (present in 20 to 30 percent), and s100 protein (marker of neural differentiation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-for-the-characterization-of-subepithelial-lesions-of-the-upper-gastrointestinal-tract/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>It was previously thought that some GISTs (less than 1 to 2 cm in size and with a low mitotic rate) were benign. However, the current thinking is that virtually all GISTs, especially those greater than 1 cm, have malignant potential.

Color Doppler can be used to detect blood flow, which will immediately confirm a vascular structure, distinguishing a varix from other anechoic subepithelial lesions such as a cyst. A potential problem using a dedicated echoendoscope to image small varices is the tendency to compress the varix by the instrument or with inflation of the transducer balloon. This can be overcome by using a catheter ultrasound probe (miniprobe) inserted through the working channel of an endoscope. The miniprobe permits precise endoscopic targeting of the varix with a small diameter (about 3 mm) transducer that will not compress the varix.
