There are many types of hypersensitivity reactions, which are broadly divided into immediate and delayed reactions, based upon the time between the first administered dose and the appearance of signs or symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-macrolides-aminoglycosides-tetracyclines-clindamycin-and-metronidazole/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediate reactions are defined as reactions that begin within one hour of the first administered dose. In reality, symptoms and signs may appear up to one to two hours later if the drug was taken orally or with food or other medications that slow absorption. The most common signs and symptoms of immediate reactions are urticaria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F75230\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75230 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72519\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72519 \">picture 2</a>), pruritus, flushing, angioedema of the face, extremities, or laryngeal tissues (leading to throat tightness with stridor or rarely, asphyxiation), wheezing, nausea, abdominal cramping or diarrhea, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypotension or shock. Immediate reactions can be caused by the formation of immunoglobulin E (IgE) to the causative drug, which can then activate mast cells and basophils in the presence of the drug. Some drugs can cause immediate reactions by directly or indirectly activating mast cells and basophils, without the presence of drug-specific IgE. Immediate-type skin testing is used to evaluate immediate reactions. (See <a href=\"#H8608938\" class=\"local\">'Allergy evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed reactions begin later than one hour (and sometimes days) after the first dose. Many different reaction types are classified as delayed. The most common are maculopapular or morbilliform exanthems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F54205\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54205 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F70062\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70062 \">picture 4</a>). There is a lack of consensus about how best to evaluate patients with past maculopapular exanthems. Some allergy experts perform intradermal skin testing that is interpreted 24 to 72 hours after placement, with erythema and induration representing a positive reaction. Others only perform graded challenges to diagnose such reactions, which is the most common approach in the United States.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are several types of delayed hypersensitivity reactions that are uncommon but potentially life-threatening for which no testing is informative. Furthermore, testing can be dangerous because re-exposure can cause a recurrence of the reaction. Such reactions include Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/drug-induced</span> hypersensitivity syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(DRESS/DiHS)</span>.</p><p/><p>The intent of discriminating between immediate and delayed drug reactions is to distinguish immediate reactions from other types, since immediate reactions can escalate to potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis if the patient is re-exposed to the causative drug, even in very small amounts.</p><p>The classification and pathogenesis of drug hypersensitivity reactions are reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Classification and clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8608945\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of a patient with a past drug reaction always begins with a careful clinical history and an assessment of the type of hypersensitivity reaction the patient most likely experienced. Important questions for the patient with drug allergy are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-approach-to-the-patient-with-drug-allergy#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An approach to the patient with drug allergy&quot;, section on 'Clinical history'</a>.)</p><p>A thorough history of the reaction is essential and usually constitutes the most useful element of the evaluation. Many patients labeled as allergic to a drug actually experienced nonallergic adverse reactions. Common examples include gastrointestinal side effects with macrolides and tetracyclines or photosensitivity with tetracyclines. In some cases, such patients should continue to avoid the causative drug, but they are not candidates for further allergy evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8608741\"><span class=\"h2\">Referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Referral to an allergy expert with experience in drug-allergic reactions is appropriate in any of the following situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has reactions to numerous antibiotics, and treatment options are becoming limited.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient experienced a life-threatening reaction to a drug and requires advice about how best to prevent re-exposure and whether related antibiotics can be safely administered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient experienced a serious reaction in the context of receiving multiple drugs (eg, perioperative anaphylaxis), and the cause of the reaction is not clear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has a high likelihood of needing future treatment with a certain drug due to the nature of <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> underlying medical problems.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8608938\"><span class=\"h2\">Allergy evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical history is the most important component of a drug allergy evaluation. Other tools that are widely used include immediate-type skin testing and graded challenge. These procedures should be performed by allergy specialists because they require experience to interpret correctly, and although they are considered safe interventions, there is a risk of inducing another allergic reaction. Skin testing and challenges should be performed in a setting prepared to treat possible severe reactions, including anaphylaxis. In addition, any procedure that involves the deliberate exposure of a patient to a substance to which <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> may be allergic should be undertaken by someone with specific training in these techniques.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8609129\"><span class=\"h3\">Immediate-type skin testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin testing (prick-puncture and intradermal) is helpful in the evaluation of immediate reactions to some drugs. Briefly, prick-puncture skin testing should be performed first, along with positive and negative controls. If prick-puncture tests are negative, they are followed by intradermal skin testing. Skin test results are recorded 15 minutes after placement in the skin. Skin testing techniques and patient preparation are described in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;, section on 'Prick/puncture method'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;, section on 'Intradermal method'</a>.)</p><p>Unlike skin testing for penicillin allergy, skin testing for allergy to the drugs discussed in this review is not standardized or validated, and allergy experts may have different approaches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8609147\"><span class=\"h3\">Graded challenge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Graded challenge procedures may be required in the evaluation of antibiotic hypersensitivity.

Most patients reporting macrolide reactions prove not to have a serious allergy. If patients from the largest published series are combined, the cumulative rate of reactions upon challenge with the culprit drug in patients with history of convincing macrolide allergy was 5 percent (13 of 255 subjects), and most reactions were mild [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-macrolides-aminoglycosides-tetracyclines-clindamycin-and-metronidazole/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p>The following studies address specific types of reactions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions to macrolides are rare and largely confined to anecdotal case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-macrolides-aminoglycosides-tetracyclines-clindamycin-and-metronidazole/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vast majority of skin reactions are maculopapular exanthems:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In an analysis of over 40 clinical trials of children treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> for various bacterial infections, 29 of 2655 (1.1 percent) developed skin eruptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-macrolides-aminoglycosides-tetracyclines-clindamycin-and-metronidazole/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

In these, the majority of patients who reacted to one macrolide (mostly with delayed reactions) tolerated other macrolides, suggesting little allergic cross-reactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypersensitivity-reactions-to-macrolides-aminoglycosides-tetracyclines-clindamycin-and-metronidazole/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. However, most patients were only challenged with a macrolide different from the one that caused the initial reaction. Although understandable, this approach is not sufficient to prove lack of cross-reactivity, because many patients will tolerate the culprit drug if it is given again. To conclusively prove lack of cross-reactivity, challenges to both drugs should be done in close temporal association, which is rarely done.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3201856\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>History is an essential first step in evaluating patients who report an allergy to macrolides. If the patient's history suggests an immunologic reaction, referral to an allergy expert may be appropriate, although this is usually not warranted in patients who report past allergic reactions <strong>only</strong> to macrolides, because there are multiple alternative groups of antibiotics. Possible exceptions to this include patients predisposed to sinopulmonary infections because macrolides are very useful for these infections.

In the author's clinic, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> is the only macrolide used for skin testing.

We prefer to challenge with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> (rather than other macrolides) because it is available in both parenteral and oral formulations to treat future infections. Also, azithromycin has a more favorable gastrointestinal side effect profile compared with other macrolides. Patients with recent severe anaphylaxis should undergo rapid desensitization rather than graded challenge.

The reason for giving the initial dose under observation is the author's experience that, unless the patient knows that the drug can be safely ingested, there may be continued reluctance to use it in the future. A delayed reaction may occur during the 24 hours following the initial dose, and patients should be instructed to inform the clinician if this occurs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is important to understand the limitations of challenge procedures for delayed maculopapular exanthema. Some of these reactions only recur after several days of therapy, and there is no practical way to elicit such reactions without administering a full therapeutic course. This should be explained to patients.</p><p/><p>After completion of the challenge procedure, patients who do not need the antibiotic at that time can simply take it normally in the future. Patients who need macrolide therapy at that time can continue the treatment for a full course.</p><p>If a patient develops a mild exanthema during future courses of therapy, it may be reasonable to attempt to continue the drug and add antihistamine therapy, provided that the reaction lacks any worrisome features. This approach has not been formally studied and is only appropriate when the benefit of continued treatment clearly outweighs the risk of further reaction.

Hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions are adverse reactions that are mediated by the immune system. Referral to an expert in drug allergy is indicated in specific circumstances.

Thus, skin testing with the antibiotics discussed in this topic is much less informative than that performed to evaluate penicillin allergy. In some cases, the evaluation consists of a careful history and graded challenge. (See <a href=\"#H8608938\" class=\"local\">'Allergy evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Macrolides cause delayed-onset maculopapular exanthems in about 1 percent of treated patients, which is close to the rate in placebo-treated patients in many drug studies. Anaphylaxis and serious non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated reactions are rare. Skin testing is controversial, and graded challenge is often required for conclusive diagnosis, although there are usually alternate classes of antibiotics that can be substituted for macrolides. Patients who have reacted to one macrolide in the past may tolerate other macrolides. (See <a href=\"#H3201835\" class=\"local\">'Macrolides'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aminoglycosides are well-tolerated as a group, with the exception of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neomycin</a>, which is a relatively common cause of allergic contact dermatitis and is included on many commercial patch testing panels. Rare cases of anaphylaxis have been confirmed with immediate-type skin testing. Cross-reactivity appears to be extensive, and patients are usually advised to avoid all aminoglycosides if they have had a significant reaction to one. (See <a href=\"#H3201898\" class=\"local\">'Aminoglycosides'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> drugs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a> causes more hypersensitivity reactions than all others.

Among the other drugs, rare cases of anaphylaxis have been confirmed with immediate-type skin testing.
