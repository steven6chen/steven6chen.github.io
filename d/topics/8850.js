Infection prevention programs use protocols and interventions to decrease the risk of infection associated with exposure to healthcare settings.</p><p>The field of infection prevention emerged following the study on the efficacy of nosocomial infection control (SENIC), which demonstrated that strategies such as surveillance and feedback led to sizable decreases in hospital-acquired infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-prevention-general-principles/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Subsequently, regulatory mandates led to the establishment of formal infection prevention programs, typically supervised by physicians <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> trained nurses and overseen by hospital committees. Increasing hospital regulations, scrutiny from accreditation groups, public reporting of infection-related outcomes, and impact on hospital reimbursement have solidified infection prevention programs as a key component of healthcare activities.</p><p>The terminology surrounding infection prevention has evolved over time. Initially, infection control teams sought to reduce &quot;nosocomial&quot; infection. As the focus shifted from monitoring to preventing infection, the teams now prevent &quot;healthcare-associated infection.&quot; Similarly, as healthcare delivery has shifted from the hospital to various inpatient and outpatient venues, the term &quot;healthcare epidemiology&quot; has emerged to encompass infection prevention activities in the multiple areas where healthcare is delivered.</p><p>In general, infection prevention programs focus on two broad goals: decrease the risk of infection following exposure to healthcare settings (particularly from multidrug-resistant organisms) and decrease the risk of device- and procedure-related infections.</p><p>Issues related to general principles of infection control are reviewed here.

(See <a href=\"#H1910323\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cornerstone of successful infection control is effective surveillance, which involves counting cases and calculating rates of infections, with subsequent data reporting to hospital leadership and personnel involved in patient care. (See <a href=\"#H3669804725\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1907868\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance and feedback'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cleaning and disinfection of medical equipment and patient care areas are important measures for prevention of transmission of pathogens that may cause infection. (See <a href=\"#H362418550\" class=\"local\">'Cleaning'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to medical equipment disinfection and sterilization required depends on the equipment type.

Disinfection in healthcare settings is usually performed with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered chemicals such as those summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72222\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72222 \">table 1</a>). Special disinfectants are required to eliminate <em>Clostridium difficile</em> and nonenveloped viruses such as norovirus. (See <a href=\"#H708071018\" class=\"local\">'Healthcare environment: Cleaning and disinfection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospitals should implement ongoing training and retraining of staff with responsibility for cleaning and disinfection, together with monitoring and feedback. Consistent results may be achieved by formation of a dedicated cleaning team and implementation of a standardized cleaning process.
