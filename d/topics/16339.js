In COURAGE, 2287 patients with stable coronary heart disease were randomly assigned to either aggressive medical therapy alone or aggressive medical therapy plus PCI with bare-metal stenting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stable-ischemic-heart-disease-indications-for-revascularization/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients were required to have both objective evidence of ischemia and significant disease in at least one coronary artery; 87 percent were symptomatic and 58 percent had Canadian Cardiovascular Society class II or III angina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 1</a>). All patients received optimal medical therapy. At a median follow-up of 4.6 years, there was no significant difference between the two treatment strategies for the primary end point of death from any cause and non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI; approximately 19 percent in both groups). In addition, there was no significant difference in the rates of hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome (approximately 12 percent in both groups). Patients in the PCI group underwent significantly fewer subsequent revascularization procedures (21 versus 33 percent, hazard ratio 0.60, 95% credibility interval [CI] 0.51-71). In a report of outcomes of 1121 participants at 15 years of follow-up (median 6.2 years), no significant difference in the rate of death was found in the two groups (24 and 25 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stable-ischemic-heart-disease-indications-for-revascularization/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>A 2014 network meta-analysis evaluated all-cause mortality in 95 trials (n = 93,553 patients) that compared one type of coronary revascularization (CABG or stenting) to another or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stable-ischemic-heart-disease-indications-for-revascularization/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. For patients who received a drug-eluting stent (DES) the analysis was by stent type; early generation stents included paclitaxel-, sirolimus-, and zotarolimus-eluting (Endeavor) stents and new generation stents included everolimus- and zotarolimus-eluting (Resolute) stents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65603\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65603 \">table 2</a>). Compared with initial medical treatment, newer generation DES were associated with reduced mortality compared with medical treatment (everolimus-eluting: rate ratio [RR] 0.75, 95% CI 0.59-0.96; zotarolimus-eluting [Resolute] RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.42-1.00). The estimated rate ratios for balloon angioplasty, bare metal stents, paclitaxel-eluting stents, and sirolimus-eluting stents were less than one but not significant (0.92, 0.92, 0.91, and 0.88, respectively). In an analysis restricted to 88 contemporary trials (1990 or later), compared with the main analysis, the point estimates of the rate ratio for the everolimus- and zotarolimus-(Resolute) eluting stents moved closer to the null effect line (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65-1.03 and 0.71, 95% CI 0.46-1.11, respectively).</p><p>This network meta-analysis raises the question as to whether newer generation DES may be associated with improved survival compared to medical therapy. However, limitations of this study, including only one direct comparison of a newer generation DES to medical therapy, inclusion of only patients enrolled in clinical trials, and absence of individual patient data prevent us from altering our recommendations for when to recommend PCI with stenting. &#160;</p><p>Other meta-analyses comparing optimal medical therapy to PCI have come to differing conclusions regarding a possible mortality benefit from PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stable-ischemic-heart-disease-indications-for-revascularization/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. A 2013 meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials with over 37,000 patient-years of follow-up found a non-significant 12 percent reduction in all-cause mortality comparing PCI to optimal medical therapy (incident RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75-1.03) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stable-ischemic-heart-disease-indications-for-revascularization/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A 2015 meta-analysis of three randomized trials included only patients (n = 1557) with documented myocardial ischemia: FAME 2, the nuclear substudy of COURAGE, and SWISS 2. PCI was associated with lower all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.30-0.92) during a mean follow-up of 3.0 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stable-ischemic-heart-disease-indications-for-revascularization/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. This meta-analysis is limited to the extent that there were only 70 deaths in total. </p><p>We acknowledge it is possible that a subset of stable patients, such as those with moderate to severe ischemia, might derive a survival benefit from PCI. Ongoing randomized trials are evaluating this issue.

For these patients with multivessel disease, PCI is a reasonable intervention to improve the quality of life. In patients with predominant single-vessel disease, one study raises the possibility that PCI may not significantly lower the anginal burden compared with medical therapy.</p><p>The 2004 MASS II trial randomly assigned 611 patients with multivessel disease, preserved left ventricular systolic function, and stable angina to CABG, PCI (with bare-metal stenting in 72 percent and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty alone in 28 percent), or optimal medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stable-ischemic-heart-disease-indications-for-revascularization/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The primary end point was freedom from all-cause death, MI, or refractory angina requiring revascularization. At one year, 88 percent of the patients in the CABG group, 79 percent in the PCI group, and 46 percent in the medical therapy group were free of angina (p&lt;0.0001). In addition, freedom from all-cause death, MI, or refractory angina requiring revascularization was significantly lower with PCI than with medical therapy or CABG (76 versus 88 and 93 percent, respectively).</p><p>The 2017 ORBITA trial randomly assigned 230 patients with stable Canadian Cardiovascular Society class II and III angina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F96797\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96797 \">table 3</a>) and severe (&ge;70 percent) single-vessel stenosis to PCI with a current generation drug-eluting stent or a placebo procedure after six weeks of medical therapy optimization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stable-ischemic-heart-disease-indications-for-revascularization/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Optimal medical therapy, including dual antiplatelet therapy, statin, and antianginal therapy, was continued after the procedure. Evaluation with exercise testing, symptom questionnaires, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography was performed before randomization and at six-week follow-up. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the primary end point of exercise time increment (28.4 versus 11.8 seconds, respectively; difference in increment between groups 16.6 seconds, 95% CI -8.9 to 42 seconds; p = 0.200). Similarly, there were no differences in the rates of other exercise variables or patient-reported anginal symptoms. Patients and all health care providers in contact with patients after the intervention were blinded. Prior studies have suggested that interventions that improve exercise time by more than 30 seconds are clinically relevant. </p><p>Despite the groundbreaking design of this interventional cardiology trial that likely eliminated a significant source of potential bias by blinding patients and caregivers, we believe the study is flawed in important ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The study is underpowered for the primary outcome (small sample size).

It is important to have additional discussions with the patient after diagnostic angiography and before proceeding with PCI. In those cases that may be considered for PCI or CABG, we agree with the concept of the &ldquo;Heart Team&rdquo; to fully discuss the risks and benefits of both PCI and CABG as well as optimal medical therapy. We support the &ldquo;Heart Team&rdquo; approach in decision-making, in which an interventional cardiologist, cardiac surgeon, and other healthcare professionals discuss revascularization options with the patient in advance of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stable-ischemic-heart-disease-indications-for-revascularization/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H720449\"><span class=\"h2\">Severity of coronary artery disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is some evidence that in patients with more severe coronary artery disease, but who do not meet criteria for CABG, outcomes are better with PCI than optimal medical therapy.

The primary end point was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or unplanned hospitalization leading to urgent revascularization at 24 months. The study was stopped early (after randomization of 888 of the projected 1632 patients) by the data and safety monitoring board. After a mean duration of follow-up of 213 days, the primary end point occurred less often in patients who underwent PCI (4.3 versus 12.7 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 0.32, 95% CI 0.19-0.53). At two-year follow-up, the rate of the primary end point was lower in the PCI group (8.1 versus 19.5 percent; HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.26-0.57) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stable-ischemic-heart-disease-indications-for-revascularization/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This result was driven by a lower rate of urgent revascularization in the PCI group (4.0 versus 16.3 percent; HR 0.23, 95% CI 0.14-0.38). </p><p>Important limitations of FAME 2 include the absence of noninvasive documentation of ischemia prior to diagnostic coronary angiography, the possibility (in the absence of blinding) that the threshold for referring patients for PCI was lower in the medical therapy group, and the fact that it was stopped early [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stable-ischemic-heart-disease-indications-for-revascularization/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Despite these limitations, we believe FAME 2 supports the use of PCI in patients with documented ischemia involving at least a moderate myocardial territory. We prefer to limit the use of FFR in this setting to intermediate lesions (50 to 70 percent diameter stenosis by visual estimate) or cases where the documentation of at least moderate ischemia is equivocal. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduced left ventricular systolic function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the most part, patients enrolled in the randomized trials discussed above have had normal or near normal left ventricular systolic function. The role of revascularization in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy is discussed separately.

As mentioned above, both procedures improve symptoms compared to medical therapy in selected patients. CABG has been shown to improve survival in subgroups of patients with coronary artery disease, such as those with left main coronary artery disease; when CABG cannot be performed, PCI may improve survival in these subgroups, but evidence is less robust.</p><p>Studies that directly compared CABG to PCI form the basis for choosing between the two in patients for whom both might be considered. In general, CABG is preferred to PCI for many patients in whom a survival benefit from revascularization has been demonstrated.
