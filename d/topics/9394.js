Pooled data from the randomized trials demonstrated improvement in peak oxygen uptake, increase in interventricular septum thickness, and reduction in left ventricular end-systolic wall stress with growth hormone compared with placebo. Pooled data from all studies suggested additional associations with growth hormone administration, including improvements in LVEF, NYHA functional class, and exercise duration, but there was significant heterogeneity among studies for LVEF.</p><p>A later study found that growth hormone deficiency was frequent in patients with HF and that treatment of growth hormone deficiency can improve cardiovascular parameters.

Of the 63 growth hormone-deficient patients, 56 were randomly assigned to growth hormone plus standard therapy or standard therapy alone. At six months, growth hormone replacement therapy improved quality-of-life score, peak oxygen uptake, and exercise duration compared with standard therapy alone. At four-year follow-up of 17 patients in the growth hormone group and 14 in the control group, growth hormone improved peak oxygen uptake and LVEF while reducing left ventricular end-systolic volume index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-and-emerging-therapies-for-heart-failure/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The general application of growth hormone administration in dilated cardiomyopathy should be considered with caution.

Clinical studies have investigated use of skeletal myoblasts, bone marrow mononuclear cells, bone marrow progenitor cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and cardiac stem cells to treat patients with chronic HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-and-emerging-therapies-for-heart-failure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>The mechanism of benefit from cell therapy is uncertain. Some studies have demonstrated that hematopoietic stem cells do not transdifferentiate into cardiac myocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-and-emerging-therapies-for-heart-failure/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>], except for a low rate of cell fusion events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-and-emerging-therapies-for-heart-failure/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and autologous skeletal myoblasts can contract but do not transdifferentiate into cardiomyocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-and-emerging-therapies-for-heart-failure/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The benefit from cellular therapy is likely a paracrine effect in which transplanted cells produce growth factors, cytokines, and other signaling molecules that improve myocardial function via mechanisms such as increased myocardial perfusion due to angiogenesis, prolongation of the survival of myocytes or other cells, or activation of progenitor cells within the myocardium that can differentiate into new cardiomyocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-and-emerging-therapies-for-heart-failure/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>].</p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis included 23 randomized controlled trials of autologous adult <span class=\"nowrap\">stem/progenitor</span> cells compared with <span class=\"nowrap\">stem/progenitor</span> cells in 1255 participants with chronic ischemic heart disease and HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-and-emerging-therapies-for-heart-failure/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The meta-analysis found low-quality evidence of mortality benefit at &ge;12 months based upon data from eight trials with 494 participants. However, low-quality evidence indicated that mortality at &lt;12 months was not significantly improved based upon data from 21 trials with 1138 participants. Moderate-quality evidence for improvement in LVEF and NYHA functional class was found at &lt;12 months and at &ge;12 months. Adverse events were rare, and no long-term adverse events were reported. </p><p>The limited clinical data available do not permit a full assessment of the potential risks of cellular cardiomyoplasty as a therapeutic modality. Three concerns are ventricular arrhythmias (particularly after myoblast injection), myocardial ischemia, and undesired cell differentiation (eg, bone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-and-emerging-therapies-for-heart-failure/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] or perivascular fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-and-emerging-therapies-for-heart-failure/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]).

In an initial double-blind trial, 75 patients with NYHA functional chronic class III to IV HF were randomized to receive either IMT or placebo for six months with continuation of standard HF therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-and-emerging-therapies-for-heart-failure/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Immunomodulation produced significant reductions in the risk of death and the risk of hospitalization. There was nonsignificant improvement in NYHA functional classification and quality of life and no change in LVEF.</p><p>In a larger double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 2426 patients with NYHA functional class II to IV HF with reduced ejection fraction were randomized to receive IMT or placebo with a mean follow-up of 10.2 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-and-emerging-therapies-for-heart-failure/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. There was no significant effect on the primary end point, time to death from any cause, or first hospitalization for cardiovascular reasons. However, in two prespecified subgroups, patients with no history of previous myocardial infarction (n = 919) and patients with NYHA II HF (n = 689), IMT was associated with reductions in the primary end point (odds ratio [OR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.57-0.95 and OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46-0.8, respectively).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1101912978\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiviral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is evidence of viral genome in endomyocardial biopsy specimens by the polymerase chain reaction in patients with chronic dilated cardiomyopathy.

EECP is a technique that increases arterial blood pressure and retrograde aortic blood flow during diastole (diastolic augmentation). Cuffs are wrapped around the patient&rsquo;s legs and, using compressed air, sequential pressure (300 mmHg) is applied (from the lower legs to lower and upper thighs) in early diastole to propel blood back to the heart. EECP has been most commonly evaluated in the treatment of refractory angina. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=new-therapies-for-angina-pectoris#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;New therapies for angina pectoris&quot;, section on 'External counterpulsation'</a>.)</p><p>Trials and registries of EECP included some patients with HF, some of whom had improvements in their exercise capacity following EECP therapy. The PEECH trial directly evaluated the possible benefit of EECP in patients with mild to moderate HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-and-emerging-therapies-for-heart-failure/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. One hundred and eighty-seven patients were randomly assigned standard medical therapy with seven to eight weeks of EECP or standard medical therapy alone. Patients assigned to EECP were slightly more likely to increase their total exercise time by more than 60 seconds (35 versus 25 percent with standard medical therapy). However, EECP did not have any effect on peak V<sub>O2</sub>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise capacity and VO2 in heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thus, this study did not achieve positive results for one of its two primary end points. In addition, the results of this single-blind trial are subject to placebo effect. Further research will be necessary to define the impact of EECP in the treatment of HF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1700332\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutritional supplements</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H157089775\"><span class=\"h3\">Coenzyme Q10</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A multicenter randomized trial found that coenzyme Q10 therapy reduced mortality and hospitalization in patients with moderate to severe HF, as described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-and-emerging-therapies-for-heart-failure/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Further data are needed to establish the efficacy and safety of coenzyme Q10 therapy in patients with HF.</p><p>Coenzyme Q10 is a vitamin-like, fat soluble quinone found in high concentrations in the mitochondria of the heart, liver, and kidney, where it is involved in electron and proton transfer during oxidative phosphorylation. It is also an antioxidant and free radical scavenger with membrane-stabilizing properties. Myocardial biopsies from patients with HF have demonstrated depletion of coenzyme Q10, an observation that provided the rationale for randomized controlled trials.</p><p>A systematic review included seven randomized trials with a total of 914 patients with HF comparing coenzyme Q10 with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-and-emerging-therapies-for-heart-failure/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Information on clinical end points was lacking. Pooled analysis suggested that coenzyme Q10 had no significant effect on LVEF or exercise capacity, but data were limited. Based on similar observations, coenzyme Q10 and other nutritional supplements were <strong>not</strong> recommended as a therapy for HF in the 2013 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-and-emerging-therapies-for-heart-failure/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>However, a subsequent randomized trial provided evidence of clinical benefit from coenzyme Q10. In the Q-SYMBIO trial, 420 patients with chronic NYHA functional class III or IV HF were randomly assigned to either coenzyme Q10 100 mg three times daily or placebo, in addition to standard therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-and-emerging-therapies-for-heart-failure/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Patients assigned to coenzyme Q10 had lower rates of cardiovascular mortality (9 versus 16 percent), all-cause mortality (10 versus 18 percent), and incidence of hospitalization for HF at two years. In addition, NYHA class was improved in the coenzyme Q10 group.
