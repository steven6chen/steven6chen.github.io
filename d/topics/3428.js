It has not spread outside of the prostate gland.</p><p>This type of prostate cancer usually grows slowly and does not usually lead to death. Many men with low-risk localized prostate cancer die from other medical problems, such as heart disease, and not from their prostate cancer.</p><p>But some low-risk localized prostate cancers will become serious and can lead to death if not treated. Unfortunately, doctors can't tell for sure which low-risk localized prostate cancers will never cause any problems and which ones are more serious.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112604910\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the treatment choices for low-risk localized prostate cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, most men can choose from the following different treatments for low-risk localized prostate cancer:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Active surveillance</strong> &ndash; Men who choose this do not have treatment for their cancer right away. But their doctor will do exams and tests on a regular basis to check whether the cancer is growing. If and when it does, men then start active treatment. Many but not all men who choose active surveillance end up having treatment for their cancer at some later point.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prostatectomy</strong>, which is surgery to remove the prostate gland</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Radiation therapy</strong> &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells. People can get radiation therapy in 2 different ways:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In &quot;external-beam radiation therapy,&quot; the radiation comes from a machine that is outside the body. This involves getting radiation every day for 4 to 8 weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In &quot;brachytherapy,&quot; the radiation comes from a source of radiation that is put into the prostate gland. This involves a 1-time treatment.</p><p/><p>Some men, especially older men with serious medical conditions, might choose not to do any of the above. Instead, they might choose &quot;watchful waiting.&quot; Watchful waiting is not exactly the same as active surveillance. It does not require regular testing, but involves treating symptoms if they happen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112604925\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I choose among the different treatments?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First, make sure you understand all the facts about your choices (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F85784\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85784 \">table 1</a>). Ask your doctor any questions you have. Then to help you decide, think about how you feel about these issues:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What the treatment involves</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benefits of the treatment &ndash; With active surveillance, men can avoid the side effects from surgery or radiation for as long as possible. With surgery, external-beam radiation therapy, and brachytherapy, the cancer is treated right away before it can grow or spread.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Downsides and side effects of the treatment &ndash; Men who choose active surveillance need to be monitored by their doctor for a long time, possibly for the rest of their lives. This might include having many biopsies. Another downside of active surveillance is knowing you have cancer and worrying about it. Also, sometimes the cancer starts growing quickly and becomes harder to treat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Surgery, external-beam radiation therapy, and brachytherapy can all cause trouble with sex. This includes trouble getting or keeping an erection. With surgery, this problem usually happens right away. With external-beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy, this problem can happen later on.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Surgery can cause incontinence, which is when people leak urine. Also, side effects such as pain, infection, and bleeding can happen with any type of surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">External-beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy have short-term and long-term side effects. Short-term, they can cause frequent bowel movements and other bowel problems. They can also cause problems with urination, including the need to urinate often or pain with urination. Long-term, these treatments sometimes make men leak urine, but this is less common.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How the treatment could affect your sex life &ndash; Active surveillance doesn't usually affect a man's sex life. But surgery, external-beam radiation therapy, and brachytherapy can cause trouble getting or keeping an erection. If you have problems with these, there are treatments (medicines or devices) that might be able to help.</p><p/><p>Your treatment might also depend on your age and general health. For example, younger men in good health often choose surgery. Older men, especially those with other medical conditions, might choose active surveillance.</p><p>Also, people with certain medical conditions cannot have some treatments. For instance, men with long-term diarrhea usually can't have external-beam radiation therapy or brachytherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112604940\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the chances my cancer will come back after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment with surgery or radiation therapy, there is a very low chance that your cancer will come back.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112604955\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I work with my doctor to make a decision?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To make a decision, let your doctor know how you feel about the different treatments and whether there is something specific that worries you. Then listen to what your doctor has to say about his or her experiences with men who had situations similar to yours. Together, you can decide which treatment is right for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112604970\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Prostate cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prostate-cancer-screening-psa-tests-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Prostate cancer screening (PSA tests) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brachytherapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brachytherapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
