Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she might also ask you to keep a diary of your urinary habits, such as how often you empty your bladder.</p><p>For other tests, your doctor will likely refer you to another doctor who specializes in bladder problems, such as a urologist or gynecologist. Tests you might need include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A urine test</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blood test</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder function tests &ndash; For these tests, the doctor puts a thin tube (called a &quot;catheter&quot;) into your urethra and fills you bladder with fluid. He or she measures how much your bladder can hold. You will then release the fluid so the doctor can see if your bladder can empty all the way.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests &ndash; These tests create pictures of the inside of the body and can include X-rays, a CT scan, and an MRI.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6662287\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. These methods might help you to better control your bladder:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder retraining &ndash; To do this, you go to the bathroom at scheduled times. For instance, you might decide that you will go every hour. You would make yourself go every hour, even if you didn't feel like you needed to. And you would try to wait until a whole hour had passed if you needed to go sooner. Then, once you got used to going every hour, you would increase the amount of time you waited in between bathroom visits. Over time, you might be able to &quot;retrain&quot; your bladder to wait 3 or 4 hours between bathroom visits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic muscle exercises &ndash; These exercises strengthen the muscles that control the flow of urine. These exercises can help, but people often do them wrong. Ask your doctor or nurse how to do them right.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6662302\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have new loss of bladder control, especially if you also have back pain or leg weakness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have neurogenic bladder and get symptoms of a urinary tract infection (also called a &quot;UTI&quot;), which include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pain or a burning feeling when you urinate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The need to urinate often</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The need to urinate right away or in a hurry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blood in the urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fever</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6662317\"><span class=\"h1\">How is neurogenic bladder treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prescription medicines &ndash; Some of these medicines relax the bladder, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxybutynin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">oxybutynin</a> (brand name: Ditropan) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propantheline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">propantheline</a> (brand name: Pro-Banthine). Others can make certain nerves more active, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bethanechol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">bethanechol</a> (brand name Urecholine). You might also need antibiotics if you get a UTI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder catheter &ndash; If you cannot empty your bladder completely, you might need to put a thin, flexible tube (called a &quot;catheter&quot;) in your urethra a few times a day. The catheter helps you empty your bladder and avoid infection and other problems. In rare case, a permanent catheter is needed.</p><p/><p>If your problems are more serious and medicine and a catheter are not helpful enough, you might need other treatments to control your bladder. These can include nerve stimulators, botulinum toxin (Botox) injections, and surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6662332\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Urinary incontinence (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-muscle-kegel-exercises-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pelvic muscle (Kegel) exercises (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Urinary incontinence in women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-treatments-for-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Urinary incontinence treatments for women (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
