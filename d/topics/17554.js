Therefore, targets for fluid repletion generally rely on assumptions of a 5 to 10 percent fluid deficit, rather than on clinical estimates of dehydration.

This should be followed by a more detailed assessment for the more subtle signs of cerebral edema, which include headache (especially sudden onset), altered or sluggish pupillary responses, age-inappropriate incontinence, as well as vomiting, restlessness, irritability, or drowsiness. Decreased heart rate, increasing blood pressure, and opisthotonic posturing are late signs in the evolution of cerebral edema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53017\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53017 \">table 3</a>). The neurological assessment should be repeated hourly throughout treatment or until the patient is clinically recovered from ketoacidosis and their mental status examination is normal. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Cerebral edema'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Severe neurologic compromise at presentation is associated with poor prognosis, primarily because such patients may have cerebral edema or be at increased risk for developing cerebral edema during therapy. This was illustrated in a retrospective multicenter study of 61 children with DKA and cerebral edema; all patients who either died or survived in a persistent vegetative state had a Glasgow coma score on admission &le;7 (score of 6 to 7 includes an abnormal or absent purposeful response to pain) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As a result, these children must be very carefully rehydrated and closely monitored during the initial 24 hours of therapy. If cerebral edema is suspected, the clinician should not hesitate to use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mannitol</a> or 3 percent saline.

The severity of DKA at presentation is typically categorized by acid-base status, as indicated by venous pH and serum bicarbonate concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72608\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72608 \">table 4</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mild &ndash; pH 7.2 to 7.3; bicarbonate 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Moderate &ndash; pH 7.1 to 7.2; bicarbonate 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe &ndash; pH &lt;7.1; bicarbonate &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span></p><p/><p>The anion gap can be used as an index of the severity of the metabolic acidosis and is calculated from the following equation:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Anion gap = Sodium &ndash; (chloride + bicarbonate); a normal anion gap is 12&plusmn;2</p></div></div><p/><p>However, the presence of a large anion gap in the absence of significant ketosis (BOHB &lt;3 mmol) strongly suggests significant lactic acidosis and the possibility of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) or sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above). During treatment, the anion gap tends to normalize before resolution of the acidosis, frequently resulting in a mild &quot;non-gap&quot; acidosis as treatment progresses. This is usually associated with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis result from the large amount of chloride administered during rehydration. Therefore, the anion gap is a better measure of effective treatment than the serum bicarbonate concentration. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic acidosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The respiratory rate also may be a helpful clue to the acid-base status because the minute volume generally increases in proportion to the severity of the acidosis. Other factors that predict more severe ketoacidosis include longer duration of symptoms, depressed level of consciousness, or compromised circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H330336544\"><span class=\"h2\">Disposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with DKA should be managed in a unit with personnel and facilities capable of frequent monitoring of clinical symptoms, fluid status, and laboratory results. The experienced clinician is in the best position to determine the safest place for therapy within their individual institutions. In most tertiary care institutions, patients should be triaged as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) or specialized inpatient diabetes care unit &ndash; For patients with signs of or risk factors for cerebral edema (altered consciousness, younger than five years of age, severe acidosis [venous pH &lt;7.1 or low pCO<sub>2</sub>], high BUN, hyper- or hypokalemia, or long duration of clinical symptoms of DKA). In some institutions, this includes patients receiving intravenous (IV) insulin and those who need frequent monitoring.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular inpatient care area (if capable of providing close monitoring) &ndash; Most other patients with DKA, except for those with mild DKA who do not meet the standards below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergency Department care with outpatient follow-up &ndash; Patients with established diabetes and mild DKA should be evaluated initially in an emergency room. A full clinical and laboratory evaluation in an emergency room setting is particularly important for patients with documented BOHB concentrations &gt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> or concerns about neurologic signs. In cases of mild DKA, initial fluid and insulin therapy in the Emergency Department can significantly improve the clinical picture and allow the medical team to discharge patients home, provided that the patient has access to point-of-care testing of both blood glucose and BOHB, and the caretakers are proficient in diabetes sick-day management. However, close monitoring and follow-up by an experienced diabetes team is required. (See <a href=\"#H1152914236\" class=\"local\">'Mild DKA'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Hospitalization with close monitoring is appropriate for young children (eg, &lt;five years of age) because of their sensitivity to insulin as compared with older children and because of their increased risk for cerebral edema. Children of any age should be treated in a hospital if the home environment does not provide close supervision and monitoring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach and principles of management are the same for all children with DKA, regardless of the severity of DKA. The clinician must individualize the treatment plan based on the child's physical and laboratory findings, and treatment will need to be adjusted over time for each child. Protocols for management of fluids and insulin dosing are helpful but should be used in conjunction with clinical reassessments and judgement. We recommend use of a flow chart to track hourly vital signs and neurologic symptoms, fluid status (goals, input, and output), and&nbsp;insulin dosing,&nbsp;as well as laboratory results (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F97153\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97153 \">table 5</a>). During initial therapy, the patient should be carefully monitored for signs of cerebral edema. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Cerebral edema'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Moderate and severe DKA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main principles of management are to administer insulin and to correct the fluid and electrolyte abnormalities of hypovolemia and whole body sodium and potassium depletion. Studies have estimated water losses of approximately 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> (range, 30 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg),</span> sodium 5 to 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/kg,</span> and potassium 6 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Approaches are based primarily on case series and clinical experience, generally focusing on the outcome of avoiding cerebral edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30197583\"><span class=\"h3\">Dehydration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DKA is a state of hyperosmolar dehydration. The volume depletion is caused by urinary losses from osmotic diuresis (due to osmotic action of glucose and ketones in the urine), as well as gastrointestinal losses from vomiting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea, if present. The overall volume deficit in children with DKA is typically between 5 and 10 percent. Fluid administration is required but should proceed cautiously to minimize the risk for cerebral edema. The goals of initial volume expansion are to restore the effective circulating volume by acutely replacing some of the sodium and water loss, and to restore glomerular filtration rate to enhance clearance of ketones and glucose from the blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Elevations in the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and hematocrit (Hct) are useful to confirm hypovolemia in DKA and to follow its correction with rehydration. Many of the clinical findings used to assess volume status are unreliable, such as the condition of the patient's oral mucus membrane, which is almost always dry because of hyperventilation and mouth breathing. Changes in skin turgor tend to underestimate the degree of dehydration because the fluid losses are from both the extracellular and intracellular spaces. In addition, the degree of extracellular fluid loss is in part masked because hyperglycemia results in a shift of water from the intracellular to the extracellular fluid compartment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Elevated urine specific gravity cannot be used as a measure of hypovolemia in patients with DKA because glucose and, to a lesser degree, ketones raise the specific gravity. Hypovolemic shock is a rare occurrence in DKA but, if present, should be promptly treated. The patient in shock should be evaluated for other causes of shock, such as sepsis. A well-planned approach to management will yield consistent progress toward recovery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Signs and symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>Most experts recommend accomplishing the volume expansion gradually and with isotonic fluids because these approaches might reduce the risk for cerebral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16,17,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,22</a>]. The evidence underlying this possible association is weak and conflicting. In one clinical study in children, high volume of fluid administration during the first four hours of treatment was one of several risk factors that predicted cerebral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Nonetheless, gradual correction of the deficit and the initial use of isotonic fluids seems prudent. In patients who are not markedly hypovolemic, this approach may even result in earlier reversal of the acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30197649\"><span class=\"h4\">Initial volume expansion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with moderate to severe DKA, we suggest initiating fluid repletion with an infusion of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> (up to a maximum volume of 1000 mL) over one hour, using isotonic saline or Ringer's lactate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15,16,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,29</a>].

We use a rate of about 2500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup></span> per 24 hours, or 1.5 times the usual maintenance rate of fluid requirement. The rate of fluid administration should not exceed 3000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup></span> per 24 hours, or 2 times the maintenance rate, unless there is objective evidence of shock. Excessive fluids may increase the risk for cerebral edema, at least over the initial 24 to 36 hours.

For most patients, 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> of potassium salts should be added to the solution to correct the total body potassium deficit. However, the appropriate solution depends on the serum potassium concentrations, and the clinician should be alert to the possibility that acute renal failure may develop due to renal vein thrombosis or acute tubular necrosis (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Serum potassium'</a> below).

The choice between one-half isotonic, Ringer's lactate solution or isotonic saline depends on the patient's circulatory status and the rise in serum sodium as the hyperglycemia is corrected. The concentration of potassium salts included in the replacement fluid should be based on serum potassium concentrations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperglycemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subsequently, an insulin infusion is begun at a rate of 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/kg</span> per hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. To avoid unnecessary delay, we suggest initiating the order for the insulin infusion as soon as DKA is recognized, and preparing the insulin infusion while the fluid bolus is being administered. A lower dose of 0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/kg</span> per hour may be used initially in younger children who may be more sensitive to insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,30</a>]. The efficacy of a lower initial dose of insulin is supported by a randomized trial in a study of 50 children with DKA, which reported that a low-dose insulin infusion (0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/kg</span> per hour) was as effective as standard dose insulin (0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/kg</span> per hour) in rate of blood glucose decrease and time to achieve the blood glucose target of 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Further trials are needed to determine whether there are any advantages or complications arising from the use of the low-dose infusion. There is no specific evidence that the established initial dose of insulin (0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per hour) is the etiology of any of the complications associated with our standard management of DKA in children and adolescents.</p><p>Guidelines suggest delaying the start of the insulin infusion for at least one hour after starting fluid replacement and avoiding an initial insulin bolus because of concerns that more vigorous insulin replacement might increase the risk for cerebral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17</a>]. However, it should be recognized that these approaches are based on limited data from a single clinical study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] that may be underpowered to have confidence in this conclusion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Technique</strong> &ndash; The insulin can be mixed in one-half isotonic saline and administered in a syringe infusion pump to control the rate of insulin administration. The solution should be concentrated as much as possible and should be flushed through the tubing, to minimize binding of insulin to the tubing and syringe. As an example, 50 units of short-acting (&quot;regular&quot;) insulin are added to 50 mL of one-half isotonic saline, providing 1 unit per mL of infusate. The syringe is then &quot;piggybacked&quot; into the patient's indwelling IV catheter as close as possible to the venous site.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Within 60 minutes, steady state serum insulin levels are achieved (100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">microU/mL),</span> which offset insulin resistance, suppress glucose and fatty acid mobilization (and indirectly inhibits ketogenesis), and stimulate peripheral glucose uptake and metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In addition, volume expansion will lower the serum glucose by dilution.

In this technique, two bags of the selected saline solution are prepared, one of which contains 10 percent dextrose and the other does not contain dextrose. By adjusting the relative rates of fluid administration from each bag, the rate of fluid administration can be maintained constant, while the variable rate of dextrose infusion can be achieved to respond to changes in the patient's serum glucose concentrations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dose adjustment</strong> &ndash; In most patients, the hyperglycemia corrects before the ketoacidosis. When the serum glucose concentration decreases to 250 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (13.9 to 16.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> the IV fluid infusion should be changed to 5 percent dextrose in normal saline, one-half normal saline, or Ringer's lactate solution. This allows continued administration of insulin, which is often necessary to correct the residual ketoacidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. If the serum glucose falls below 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (8.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> before complete resolution of the ketoacidosis, the concentration of dextrose in the IV solution should be increased (eg, to 10 or 12.5 percent) to permit continued or increased rates of insulin infusion. To avoid hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, it is advisable to keep serum glucose concentrations around 100 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in older children (5.5 to 8.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> or 150 to 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (8.3 to 11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> for younger children, throughout the insulin infusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For most patients, the insulin infusion rate should be reduced only after the ketoacidosis is corrected or nearly corrected. However, if the patient shows marked sensitivity to insulin, as in some younger or malnourished children, it may be necessary to decrease the insulin infusion rate to avoid hypoglycemia (eg, to 0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg/hour),</span> provided that the ketoacidosis continues to improve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the ketoacidosis does not improve during the first two to four hours of the insulin infusion, the patient should be reassessed. Possible explanations are severe insulin resistance (due to infection, dehydration, acidosis, etc), incorrect preparation of the insulin infusion, and decreased insulin delivery due to binding of insulin to the IV tubing or pump failure. We recommend preparing a new insulin syringe and a new pump to rule out these possibilities. In many such patients, the insulin dose just needs to be increased.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In unusual circumstances, and especially if facilities to administer IV insulin are not readily available, subcutaneous or intramuscular insulin can be used as initial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,35,36</a>]. However, when insulin is administered subcutaneously, absorption may be inconsistent, particularly in the setting of volume depletion and secondary sympathetic activation, which can decrease local perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H330338007\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrolyte and acid-base disturbances</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h4\">Serum sodium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum sodium concentration at the time of diagnosis with DKA can vary widely, but many patients have mild hyponatremia due to osmotic effects of hyperglycemia combined with intake of free water. Measurements of serum sodium are also artifactually decreased by lipemia (severe hyperlipidemia causes pseudohyponatremia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite the variability in serum sodium concentration at the time of presentation, DKA is a form of hypertonic dehydration, and care must be taken in rehydrating the patient to minimize risks from rapid fluid shifts, which may precipitate or be involved in the development of cerebral edema. Reversing the hyperglycemia with fluid expansion and insulin administration will lower the plasma osmolality, cause water to move from the extracellular fluid into the cells, and raise the serum sodium concentration. During rehydration, the clinician must serially assess the serum sodium concentration and ensure that it is rising gradually and appropriately as plasma glucose concentration decreases. Failure of the serum sodium to rise appropriately could be an early sign that the patient is at risk for cerebral edema, as suggested by a few studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-42</a>]. However, a causal association between the rate or concentration of sodium administered during treatment for DKA and the development of cerebral edema has not been conclusively established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>In our practice, we measure serum sodium hourly for the first three to four hours and then every two hours, to assess the anticipated changes of serum sodium described above. When clinically appropriate, the frequency of measurement can be reduced to every four to six hours.</p><p>With appropriate replacement of fluids and electrolytes in a child who is otherwise improving, the serum sodium concentration should gradually increase. The expected rise in serum sodium (Na) attributable to the decrease in serum glucose can be calculated according to the following formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Corrected serum Na = Measured serum Na + <span class=\"nowrap\">[&Delta;SG</span> &divide; 42]</p></div></div><p/><p><span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;SG</span> is the increment above normal in the serum glucose concentration (in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL;</span> the <span class=\"nowrap\">&Delta;SG</span> should be divided by 2.3 if measured in <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Thus, serum sodium should rise by approximately 2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> for every 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> decrease in plasma glucose concentration, or 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> for each 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> decrease in plasma glucose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Some clinicians plot the sodium concentration on a nomogram (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64779\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64779 \">figure 1</a>) to facilitate tracking of changes in serum sodium during insulin treatment and to help identify patients in whom the serum sodium does not rise appropriately.</p><p>If the serum sodium fails to rise appropriately, consideration should be given to increasing the sodium concentration in the infused fluids and decreasing their rate of administration. The patient should be carefully monitored for early signs of cerebral edema.

However, serum potassium at the time of presentation can be normal, increased, or decreased. This is because the combination of insulin deficiency, which impairs potassium entry into the cells, and hyperosmolality, which pulls water and potassium out of the cells, tend to raise the serum potassium, and often result in normal or elevated serum levels of potassium despite the total body deficit.</p><p>Regardless of the initial serum potassium level, insulin therapy drives potassium into cells, resulting in a fall in the serum potassium concentration. Thus, potassium replacement will almost always be required within one to two hours of the initiation of fluid and insulin therapy in children with DKA, except in those with renal failure. In our experience, most patients present with potassium levels in the normal or high range, due to dehydration and prerenal azotemia. After initial IV expansion, the potassium concentration generally falls into the normokalemic or mildly hypokalemic range. It is uncommon for patients to have hypokalemia before fluid expansion. However, should this be the case, more aggressive potassium replacement is indicated.</p><p>Optimal therapy varies with the initial serum potassium concentration. Regardless of the regimen, the serum potassium should be carefully monitored during therapy. In addition, electrocardiographic monitoring is recommended in patients with either hyperkalemia or hypokalemia.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient is <strong>hyperkalemic</strong>, potassium replacement should not be given initially, but should be initiated when the serum potassium falls to normal and after verifying urine production. Verifying urine production is important before beginning potassium replacement because acute renal failure may develop during DKA, due to acute tubular necrosis from volume depletion, or renal vein thrombosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient is <strong>normokalemic</strong> <strong>and voiding</strong>, potassium replacement should be given with the start of insulin therapy. The usual starting concentration is 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> of potassium added to the saline solution (but not in the initial fluid bolus). Potassium replacement is needed because insulin will reduce the serum potassium by increasing its transport to the intracellular space.

The serum potassium concentrations should be monitored hourly and the replacement adjusted as needed. Hypokalemia preceding volume expansion is uncommon, and potassium replacement should be based on laboratory measurements and not started empirically.</p><p/><p>Potassium replacement is usually given as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">potassium chloride</a>.

Potassium replacement therapy should continue throughout IV insulin and fluid therapy, and the serum potassium should be carefully monitored. Oral potassium supplements may be used if the patient is receiving maximum allowable IV supplementation. Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is prudent, especially for patients with hypokalemia or severe DKA at baseline. ECG features of hypokalemia include T-wave flattening or inversion, appearance of a U-wave, and prolonged PR interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h4\">Metabolic acidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the diagnosis of ketoacidosis has been established (as opposed to lactic acidosis), either the calculated anion gap or measured beta-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB) concentrations can be used to monitor the progress of treatment. The blood bicarbonate concentration is <strong>not</strong> a good parameter to monitor the progress of treatment, or resolution of the ketoacidosis, as explained below.</p><p>During treatment, insulin and fluid repletion leads to partial correction of the acidosis. Insulin promotes the metabolism of ketoacid anions (BOHB and acetoacetic acid), resulting in the generation of bicarbonate. Insulin also halts the production of new ketoacids, which are generated in the liver from free fatty acids mobilized from fat in the absence of insulin. Meanwhile, the rehydration improves renal perfusion and promotes renal excretion of the glucose and ketone bodies. Improved tissue perfusion corrects any mild lactic acidosis that might be present.</p><p>During this process, the anion gap is a better indicator of effective clearance of ketosis than the serum bicarbonate, because the ketoacids could be cleared before the acidosis totally resolves. Although oxidation of the ketoacids helps to reduce the acidosis (some to refer to these ketoacids as &quot;potential bicarbonate&quot;), some ketoacids are lost in the urine before they can be converted into bicarbonate. Moreover, regeneration of bicarbonate in the kidney is delayed by the high chloride content in IV fluids; a patient with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis may have normal anion gap and BOHB, but a low bicarbonate concentration.</p><p>Measurements of serum beta-hydroxybutyrate permit direct measurement of the degree of ketoacidosis.

It is important to remember that insulin and fluids will not correct a metabolic acidosis due to hyperchloremia. As the ketonemia is nearly resolved, consideration can be given to decreasing the insulin infusion rate, which will result in a decreased IV fluid infusion rate, and permitting oral hydration. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Hyperglycemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrolytes and venous pH should be evaluated hourly for the first three to four hours and then every two hours. When clinically appropriate, the frequency of measurement can be reduced to every four to six hours. These measurements are used to assess the anticipated changes of sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, and anion gap. Measurement of serum beta-hydroxybutyrate, if available, should be used because this test permits direct monitoring of ketoacidosis during recovery.

Several explanations might be suggested: first, during the course of rehydration, the patients have received an excess of chloride and have developed a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. In addition, correction of the ketoacidosis may not necessarily result in complete correction of the metabolic acidosis. The residual acidosis is associated with a normal anion gap that is due to urinary loss of ketoacid anions, which represents the loss of &quot;potential bicarbonate,&quot; as noted above. In either case, insulin therapy will have no further effect on the acidosis. Thus, a persistent acidosis with normal anion gap is not a contraindication for switching the patient to subcutaneous insulin, since there are no circulating ketoacids remaining. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic acidosis'</a> above.)</p><p>When the above conditions are met, the patient can be transitioned from the insulin infusion to subcutaneous insulin injections. The first subcutaneous injection should be given at an appropriate interval to allow for absorption before stopping insulin infusion. The onset of rapid-acting insulin (rapid acting recombinant modified human insulin) is approximately 15 minutes, whereas that of short-acting (regular) insulin is 30 to 60 minutes.

However, placement of an IV may be helpful in some cases, especially for those with nausea from DKA or an underlying gastroenteritis. If an IV is placed, a 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/kg</span> bolus of volume-expanding fluids will frequently result in subjective improvement.

Children who are younger, newly diagnosed with diabetes, or who have severe acidosis or dehydration are at the greatest risk. When cerebral edema does occur, it generally develops during the first 12 hours of treatment rather than before treatment, and protocols were strongly influenced by efforts to reduce risks. Nonetheless, cerebral edema can occur in optimally managed cases, and its immediate causes have not been established. Up to 20 percent of cases of cerebral edema occur before the initiation of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>All children should be carefully monitored for early signs of cerebral edema throughout the course of treatment for DKA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53017\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53017 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The Glasgow coma scale can be used to evaluate for neurologic dysfunction, but may not be adequately sensitive to identify children early enough for effective intervention. More subtle neurological symptoms such as new onset or intensifying headache, altered consciousness, recurrent vomiting, age-inappropriate incontinence, irritability, or lethargy may be valuable as earlier indicators of cerebral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,55</a>]. Changes detectable by head computed tomography (CT) occur late in the development of cerebral edema. Therefore, the decision to treat should be based on clinical evaluation. Imaging may be useful to exclude other causes of neurological deterioration, but should not delay treatment.
