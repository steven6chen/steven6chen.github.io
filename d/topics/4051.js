As with other forms of acute leukemia, in experimental systems only a small fraction of tumor cells appear to be able to establish disease in immunodeficient mice, suggesting that the tumor is maintained by a small number of leukemia initiating cells (so-called leukemia stem cells). Uncertainty remains regarding the precise identity of these cells, which may lie at the root of T-LBL and therefore be the key cells to target if patients are to be cured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-precursor-t-cell-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H732703\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGIC DATA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Precursor T cell <span class=\"nowrap\">LBL/ALL</span> occurs most frequently in late childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with a 2:1 male predominance; it comprises 15 and 25 percent of childhood and adult ALL, respectively, and 2 percent of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-precursor-t-cell-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/3,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5-7</a>].

In most patients the mediastinal mass is anterior, bulky, and associated with pleural effusions. These masses can produce such complications as superior vena cava syndrome, tracheal obstruction, and pericardial effusions (with or without tamponade).

Abdominal involvement is very unusual, but when it does occur it is found primarily in the liver and spleen.</p><p>More than 80 percent of patients present with stage III or stage IV disease and almost 50 percent have B symptoms; in the majority, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are elevated. Although the bone marrow is frequently normal at presentation, approximately 60 percent of patients develop bone marrow infiltration and a subsequent leukemic phase indistinguishable from T cell ALL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-precursor-t-cell-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Evaluation of the spinal fluid is essential to rule out central nervous system (CNS) involvement, which is frequently seen.

For cases with a mass lesion and less than 25 percent bone marrow involvement, the term precursor T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) is used. (See <a href=\"#H733536\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Precursor T cell <span class=\"nowrap\">LBL/ALL</span> occurs most frequently in late childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood, with a male predominance; it comprises 15 percent of childhood and 25 percent of adult ALL and 2 percent of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma. (See <a href=\"#H732703\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiologic data'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral blood smear, bone marrow biopsy, and tissue biopsy can demonstrate lymphoblasts with varying morphology. Precursor T <span class=\"nowrap\">LBL/ALL</span> is morphologically indistinguishable from precursor B <span class=\"nowrap\">ALL/LBL</span>. (See <a href=\"#H732717\" class=\"local\">'Morphology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Key diagnostic studies include histochemical stains, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry. These are required to differentiate among precursor <span class=\"nowrap\">T-ALL/LBL,</span> precursor <span class=\"nowrap\">B-ALL/LBL,</span> and other acute leukemias. (See <a href=\"#H732724\" class=\"local\">'Immunophenotype and histochemistry'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of genetic abnormalities have been identified in patients with precursor <span class=\"nowrap\">T-ALL/LBL,</span> but at present these are not prognostically important.

(See <a href=\"#H732738\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age at diagnosis and chromosomal abnormalities appear to be important prognostic factors.
