The dressings and topical therapies that are used at a given facility depend upon regional and individual preference and experience, availability, and costs. </p><p>The most frequently used burn wound dressings and topical agents in adults and children will be reviewed here. The classification and management of burns by depth of burn and the specialized management of burns at specific anatomic sites are reviewed separately.

It is important to note that topical antimicrobials are used in conjunction with appropriate basic wound care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-wound-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of wound management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Burn wound surfaces are prone to rapid bacterial colonization with the potential for invasive infection. Measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include good infection control practices, topical antimicrobial therapy, and burn wound <span class=\"nowrap\">debridement/excision,</span> when needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Closed dressing management is often advocated to minimize cross-contamination by pathogens (eg, methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>)<em> </em>that can cause burn wound infection, delayed wound healing, and loss of skin grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Wounds that become infected require systemic antimicrobial therapy, in addition to the chosen regimen for local wound care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Burn wound infection and sepsis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2088109107\"><span class=\"h2\">Dressings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of antimicrobial agents (see <a href=\"#H2130890734\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial agents'</a> below) can be applied to the burn wound surface, which is then covered with one of several dressing materials (eg, gauze, nonadherent films) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81801\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81801 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60931\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60931 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>Early after injury, it may be difficult to accurately determine the depth of burn wounds, and, since burn wounds are often of mixed depths, more than one local wound care regimen may be necessary. Our approach to local burn wound care based on burn wound depth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61540\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61540 \">table 3</a>) is summarized briefly below and discussed in more depth elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H1056045855\" class=\"local\">'Approach'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-superficial-burns-requiring-hospital-admission\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of superficial burns requiring hospital admission&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gauze alone should be avoided unless there are no other options (ie, topical antimicrobials are not available). Dry gauze promotes scab formation, which will generally separate spontaneously as reepithelialization occurs. However, pain can be significant when the gauze is removed. </p><p>Nonadherent films or fine mesh gauze (in combination with topical antimicrobials) are common dressings used to cover the burn wound, but films, foams, alginates, hydrocolloids, and hydrogels can also be used depending on the specific qualities of the dressing (eg, silver containing) and the specific needs of the burn wound. These can either cover a burn wound treated with a topical agent or be applied directly to the wound. As examples, partial-thickness burns have moderate-to-high amounts of exudate, which are appropriately managed with foams and alginates. By comparison, for a graft donor site that has minimal-to-moderate exudate, the use of polyurethane, hydrocolloids, or hydrogels may be adequate. </p><p>Coverage of clean, uninfected burn wounds can also be accomplished using biologic dressings or skin substitutes. These are applied once and adhere to the wound, separating spontaneously as healing progresses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H321700557\" class=\"local\">'Temporary burn wound coverage'</a> below.) </p><p>Dressing changes should be frequent enough to control exudate but not so frequent that they interfere with wound reepithelialization. The frequency ranges from twice daily to weekly depending upon the amount of exudate and choice of dressing material. More frequent dressing changes are performed if there is a large amount of exudate, weeping, or infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Topical antimicrobials should be gently removed with dressing changes. Excessive scrubbing and sharp debridement is not necessary and may hinder healing. Management of pain in association with burn wound care is discussed separately.

In general, superficial burns do not require antimicrobial therapy, but for extensive superficial burns, topical antimicrobials may be used to prevent colonization while maintaining a moist wound healing environment. Furthermore, because superficial partial-thickness burns may not always be easily distinguished from deeper injuries, topical antimicrobial agents are often used. We generally start with a combination antimicrobial ointment or creme (eg, Polysporin) covered with a nonadherent dressing (eg, Xeroform, Adaptic, Mepitel). When in close proximity to the eyes, we use an ophthalmic ointment without steroids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-superficial-burns-requiring-hospital-admission#H2887591563\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of superficial burns requiring hospital admission&quot;, section on 'Our approach'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep burn wounds &ndash; Deep burn wounds (deep partial thickness, full thickness, and deeper) require burn wound excision and <span class=\"nowrap\">graft/flap</span> coverage. Fine mesh gauze in combination with topical antimicrobials,&nbsp;typically silver-containing agents or dressings (eg, Silvadene, Acticoat), remains the most commonly used burn dressing, providing a moist and minimally adherent provisional dressing until definitive debridement or surgical excision can be performed. Dressings are also used after surgery to cover and protect skin grafts and skin graft donor sites. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-the-severely-burned-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of the severely burned patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-surgical-procedures-used-in-the-management-of-burn-injuries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of surgical procedures used in the management of burn injuries&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Colonized/contaminated/infected</span> burn wounds &ndash; When contamination with methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) is <span class=\"nowrap\">suspected/confirmed,</span> directed topical antimicrobial treatment (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mupirocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mupirocin</a>) should be added as a treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Other treatments (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mafenide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mafenide</a>) may be more appropriate for heavily colonized or infected burn wounds (in addition to systemic antimicrobial therapy, as indicated).

In addition, there is no consensus on which agent or dressing is optimal for managing burn wounds to prevent or control infection or enhance wound healing. The various agents are described below. (See <a href=\"#H2130890734\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial agents'</a> below.)</p><p>Many randomized trials have compared the various topical agents for the treatment of burn wounds, but most are methodologically poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/1,2,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,11</a>]. A large systematic review included 56 trials with over 5800 mostly adult patients with partial-thickness burns involving less than 40 percent total body surface area (TBSA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most studies compared a given topical agent or dressing with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-sulfadiazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver sulfadiazine</a> (SSD). Other comparisons included alternative silver-based agents or dressings, iodine-based agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a>, polyhexanide, sodium hypochlorite, merbromin, ethacridine lactate, cerium nitrate, honey, aloe vera, and <em>Arnebia euchroma</em>. It is important to note that most comparisons did not report data on infection, which is an important clinical outcome. </p><p>The main results of this review for the treatment of superficial burns, and those of other reviews, are summarized:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Silver versus non-silver agents &ndash; Several systematic reviews have compared various silver preparations with non-silver-containing dressings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/1,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12-15</a>]. These have largely concluded that the evidence is not sufficient to establish whether silver-containing agents or dressings promote wound healing or prevent wound infection. One of these reviews suggested that there may be a detrimental effect from some <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-containing-dressings-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver-containing dressings</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the Cochrane review, burns treated with nanocrystalline silver dressings had a shorter mean time to healing compared with Vaseline gauze (mean difference [MD] -3.49 days, 95% CI -4.46 to -2.52). There was some evidence that burns treated with honey were more likely to heal over time compared with topical antimicrobials. (See <a href=\"#H1122628\" class=\"local\">'Honey'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Silver formulation comparison &ndash; There was no difference in the chance of healing over time comparing SSD with other silver-based agents, although other silver-based agents may have increased the number of healing events over 21- or 28-day follow-up and may slightly reduce mean time to healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a meta-analysis of five clinical trials comparing nanocrystalline silver dressings with older silver formulation dressings (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-sulfadiazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver sulfadiazine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver nitrate</a>), the nanocrystalline silver group had a significantly lower rate of infections (9.5 versus 27.8 percent), decreased pain, no clear effect on hospital length of stay, and a higher cost per patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Other silver formulations (eg, Mepilex Ag) have not demonstrated differences in wound healing but have reduced numbers of dressings and lower cost compared with SSD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-silver agent comparisons &ndash; In the Cochrane review, there were no clear differences for comparisons between most of the agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a>, wounds treated with povidone-iodine had a reduced mean time to healing (MD -2.21 days, 95% CI 0.34-4.08). </p><p/><p>Whether the use of specialized dressings (eg, biologic <span class=\"nowrap\">dressings/skin</span> substitutes) improves superficial burn wound outcomes is also uncertain. A systematic review that included 30 randomized trials (most with methodologic shortcomings) did not identify an optimal dressing type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A separate review of 20 trials noted that skin substitutes were at least as effective as topical agents and wound dressings or allografts for the management of partial-thickness burns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. For younger patients, biologic substitutes may provide optimal coverage for superficial burns. In a review of 51 observational studies and randomized trials performed in children, biologic dressings (eg, Biobrane, DuoDerm, amnion membrane) showed better results for eschar formation, length of hospital stay, healing time, and pain scores when compared with SSD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Other agents such as honey, povidone-iodine, and Dakin's solution are less commonly used.

For wounds covering more than 50 to 60 percent of the total body surface area, SSD does not consistently prevent or suppress bacterial growth, particularly of gram-negative bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, there are potential adverse effects. As an example, SSD will form a pseudoeschar that is loose at the edges, which can promote bacterial proliferation. The pseudoeschar requires removal or debridement to improve the ability to monitor the wound state and facilitate reepithelialization. SSD also impedes reepithelialization; as a result, SSD should be stopped when there is evidence of reepithelialization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>SSD is a thick white cream that is applied once or twice daily and can be soothing. SSD and related agents should <strong>not</strong> be used in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or in infants younger than two months old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Reports in adult and pediatric burn populations have been conflicting regarding the clinical value of cerium as measured by mortality, length of hospital stay, and bacterial colonization of the wounds. In two trials in the Cochrane review, there were fewer deaths in groups treated with cerium nitrate plus SSD compared with SSD alone (relative risk [RR] 0.22, 95% CI 0.05-0.99 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/30,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,33</a>]).

Porcine-derived xenografts do not vascularize but will adhere to a clean superficial wound, accelerate reepithelialization, and reduce pain.

The porcine collagen provides a hydrophilic coating for fibrin growth that promotes wound adherence. Biobrane has no inherent antimicrobial activity, but the membrane is porous, allowing absorption of topical antimicrobial agents and drainage of exudate. Biobrane is versatile and has additional properties of flexibility, elasticity, and transparency for wound observation. </p><p>Some biosynthetic dressings incorporate Biobrane or are of a similar nature, including Transcyte (neonatal fibroblast incorporated into Biobrane), Suprathel (resorbable caprolactone-based materials), and Omiderm (hydrophilized polyurethane membrane).

The collagen is not cross-linked to the silicone membrane, which should allow for fibrin in the wound to achieve clotting and improve acute adherence, and the porosity is increased, which should reduce the fluid accumulation and the fluid pressure on the wound. Small trials have confirmed good usability, but whether its anticipated benefits relative to Biobrane will be realized is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/68,74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,74,75</a>].</p><p>Biobrane is applied by gently stretching the fabric over the burn surface to avoid wrinkles and is secured to nonburned skin with paper strips [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Dry gauze is used to cover the Biobrane, and the dressings are secured with an elastic bandage. The external dressings are changed every 24 hours, and any fluid accumulating under the Biobrane is aspirated. Biobrane can be left in place for up to 14 days, then removed in a warm bath or trimmed. Healed wounds are treated with topical agents or creams. If there is evidence of a wound infection, the Biobrane is removed and the burn treated with topical antimicrobials.

We use the following approaches to manage superficial and deep burn wounds.

In general, superficial burns do not require antimicrobial therapy, but for extensive superficial burns, topical antimicrobials may be used to prevent colonization while maintaining a moist wound healing environment. Furthermore, because superficial partial-thickness burns may not always be easily distinguished from deeper injuries, topical antimicrobial agents are often used. We generally start with a combination antibiotic ointment or creme (eg, Polysporin) covered with a nonadherent dressing (eg, Xeroform, Adaptic, Mepitel). When in close proximity to the eyes, we use an ophthalmic ointment without steroids.
