As compared with TTE, TEE offers superior visualization of posterior cardiac structures because of close proximity of the esophagus to the posteromedial heart with lack of intervening lung and bone. This proximity permits use of high-frequency imaging transducers that afford superior spatial resolution.</p><p>The first practical clinical use of TEE was described in 1976 when a modified rigid endoscopic probe with single M-mode crystal was used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-indications-complications-and-normal-views/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Since that time, TEE technology has evolved rapidly with developments in flexible endoscopic probe technology, phased-array ultrasound systems, and crystal miniaturization and real time three-dimensional (3D) imaging. Current TEE probes allow for both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D imaging as well M-mode, spectral Doppler, and color flow Doppler. The versatility of these transducers permits improved penetration with lower frequency imaging and superior spatial resolution with higher frequency imaging. Additional developments have focused on further probe <span class=\"nowrap\">miniaturization/pediatric</span> probes and improvement of 3D echocardiography capability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiography-essentials-physics-and-instrumentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiography essentials: Physics and instrumentation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The indications, potential complications, and normal views associated with TEE will be reviewed here. The role for TEE in the evaluation of specific cardiac abnormalities is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-the-left-ventricle\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transesophageal echocardiography in the evaluation of the left ventricle&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-aortic-valve-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transesophageal echocardiography in the evaluation of aortic valve disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transesophageal echocardiography in the evaluation of mitral valve disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transesophageal-echocardiography-in-traumatic-rupture-of-the-aortic-isthmus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transesophageal echocardiography in traumatic rupture of the aortic isthmus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9886539\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR TEE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both TTE and TEE have a variety of clinical indications and applications. In most patients, TEE provides superior image quality, particularly for posterior cardiac structures which are nearer to the esophagus and less well visualized on transthoracic echocardiography as they are more distant from the anterior TTE transducer. Because of its moderately invasive nature, however, TEE is reserved for selected indications in which the potential benefits of making a diagnosis outweigh the risks associated with the procedure. For many but not all clinical situations, a TTE study precedes the TEE as the TTE study may obviate or help guide the TEE.</p><p>How often TEE is used for a particular indication varies from institution to institution. However, TEE is most commonly performed to evaluate for a potential cardiac source of embolus, to assess valves for endocarditis, or to exclude left atrial appendage (LAA) thrombi in patients with atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-indications-complications-and-normal-views/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a large series from the 1990s, the most common clinical indications for TEE were to evaluate for cardiac source of embolism, endocarditis, prosthetic heart valve dysfunction, native valvular disease, and aortic dissection or aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-indications-complications-and-normal-views/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thoracic magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography have largely displaced TEE for assessment of aortic <span class=\"nowrap\">aneurysm/dissection,</span> although TEE may still be utilized for diagnosis in some acute scenarios. In current practice, TEE is also performed with many cardiac surgical procedures, especially those involving congenital or valve repairs, both to verify preoperative diagnosis and to monitor the success of repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-indications-complications-and-normal-views/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, TEE is commonly used for imaging guidance during non-coronary percutaneous cardiac interventions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>TTE remains the initial test of choice for most patients requiring an echocardiogram. However, TEE should be performed as the initial test in certain life-threatening situations or in situations where TTE is likely to be nondiagnostic. Clinical situations in which TEE should be considered as the initial test include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-indications-complications-and-normal-views/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected acute aortic pathology (ie, dissection, transsection, intramural hematoma)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected prosthetic valve dysfunction (thrombus, pannus ingrowth, vegetation, or regurgitation)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected complications of endocarditis (eg, fistula, abscess)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation for left <span class=\"nowrap\">atrial/LAA</span> thrombus in a patient with atrial <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrillation/atrial</span> flutter to facilitate clinical decision making regarding anticoagulation, cardioversion, or ablation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of source of embolism in a young (&lt;50 years) patient for whom a TEE would be performed if the TTE was normal</p><p/><p>In 2011 the American College of Cardiology Foundation, in conjunction with numerous professional societies, issued Appropriate Use Criteria for Echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-indications-complications-and-normal-views/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In a series of over 28,000 TEEs performed at a single center, the incidence of methemoglobinemia was 0.07 percent (1 case per 1499 TEE studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-indications-complications-and-normal-views/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Follow-up TEE studies (eg, to monitor resolution of an atrial appendage thrombus) may be focused. </p><p>A standard comprehensive approach to imaging is recommended, but each individual study should be modified to reflect the specific clinical indication. As an example, a patient undergoing TEE examination for evaluation of LAA thrombus should include a careful, focused examination of the appendage in a continuum of imaging planes from 0&ordm; to 180&ordm;. On the other hand, an examination in a patient with suspected endocarditis should include extensive imaging of all cardiac valves.</p><p>This section will describe the normal cardiac anatomy as visualized sequentially during a routine multiplane TEE study.

With increasing severity of mitral regurgitation, there will be <span class=\"nowrap\">attenuation/decrease</span> in the pulmonary vein S wave and increase in the height of the diastolic flow [D wave]. With severe mitral regurgitation, there is reversal of the expected forward flow in the S wave Doppler spectra. Color Doppler is often helpful to visualize extension of the mitral regurgitation jet into the pulmonary veins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary artery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the transducer imaging plane in the horizontal (0&ordm;) position, the TEE probe is rotated anteriorly and withdrawn slightly to visualize the main pulmonary artery, right main pulmonary artery, and left main pulmonary artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69255\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69255 \">image 3</a>). The patient may cough or note posterior &quot;irritation&quot; during imaging at this level in the proximal esophagus, and diligent care is required to avoid extubating the TEE probe from the esophagus. The main pulmonary artery is also seen near the study conclusion with the crystal in the 90 degree orientation while examining the aortic arch.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Right and left atria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the TEE transducer tip in a neutral position, the probe is advanced and rotated anteriorly to evaluate the body of the left atrium, interatrial septum, and the body of the right atrium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79455\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79455 \">image 4</a>). The interatrial septum is evaluated at various crystal orientations with color flow Doppler to assess for evidence of an atrial septal aneurysm, an atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identification and assessment of atrial septal defects in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Further anterior rotation of the probe and intermediate transducer rotation to 40 to 60&ordm; permits visualization of the right pulmonary veins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72534\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72534 \">image 5</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Aortic leaflets and aortic root</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The probe is rotated slightly posteriorly to visualize the aortic root and aortic valve leaflets, following which the probe is rotated to 30&ordm; to 55&ordm; to image the aortic valve leaflets in short axis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69646\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69646 \">image 6</a>). Advancement and retraction of the probe in this plane will allow for imaging of the LVOT and ascending aorta, respectively. Color flow Doppler interrogation for aortic regurgitation may also be performed in this orientation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Vertical plane</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to the multiple maneuvers (anteflexion, retroflexion, retraction, advancement) of the TEE probe and transducer tip required for imaging in the horizontal plane, imaging in the vertical (90&ordm;) plane primarily involves simple anterior and posterior rotation of the probe. We begin imaging in the vertical (90&ordm;) plane with posterior structures and then rotate the probe anteriorly. The most posterior structure is the coronary sinus and left lower pulmonary vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68047\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68047 \">image 7</a>). As the probe is slowly rotated anteriorly, we image the mitral valve and two-chamber long axis view of the left atrium and left ventricle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68047\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68047 \">image 7</a>). Color Doppler interrogation of the mitral valve allows identification of central and eccentric jets of mitral regurgitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-mitral-regurgitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic mitral regurgitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Further anterior rotation of the probe allows for imaging of the LVOT and aortic valve as well as proximal ascending aorta (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58675\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58675 \">image 8</a>).</p><p>After imaging the LVOT and aortic valve in the vertical plane, multiplane imaging at 110 to 145&ordm; permits enhanced visualization of the LVOT, aortic valve, and the ascending aorta (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58675\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58675 \">image 8</a>). Anterior rotation of the probe at this crystal position also results in a favorable orientation for assessment of the tricuspid valve, right atrial appendage, and interatrial septum. Assessment of atrial septal defects or aneurysms, as well as right atrial appendage thrombi, is readily performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identification and assessment of atrial septal defects in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Returning to the vertical (90&ordm;) orientation, further rotation of the probe anteriorly allows for imaging of the pulmonic valve and main pulmonary artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57980\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57980 \">image 9</a>). With further anterior rotation, the right ventricle, tricuspid valve, and right atrium are well seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57980\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57980 \">image 9</a>). Continuous-wave Doppler may allow for velocity assessment of the tricuspid regurgitation jet from this orientation.</p><p>With further anterior rotation, the superior vena cava, right atrial appendage, body of the right atrium, interatrial septum, and inferior vena cava and Eustachian valve may be seen (the bicaval view) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71051\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71051 \">image 10</a>). Color flow Doppler evaluation of the interatrial septum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the injection of agitated saline contrast may allow for identification of an atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale in this orientation, or such examination may be performed in the 135&ordm; orientation previously described. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identification-and-assessment-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identification and assessment of atrial septal defects in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Finally, anterior rotation of the TEE probe in the vertical plane permits imaging of the right upper pulmonary vein, a vessel important to identify as it is the pulmonary vein most commonly associated with anomalous pulmonary venous return (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81803\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81803 \">image 11</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging at the gastroesophageal junction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the transducer imaging plane in the horizontal (0&ordm;) position the TEE probe is advanced toward the gastroesophageal junction (38 to 40 cm) where the right atrial appendage, tricuspid valve, and coronary sinus may be seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69903\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69903 \">image 12</a>) as the probe approaches the gastroesophageal junction.</p><p>During advancement of the probe through the gastroesophageal junction, the patient often experiences a slight epigastric discomfort. Particular diligence is required during probe advancement in patients with a large hiatus hernia to avoid curling of the transducer tip in the distal esophagus. Increased depth penetration is often needed and we customarily change to a lower imaging frequency upon entering the stomach. Anteflexion of the probe permits imaging of the left ventricle in a short axis view at the level of the mitral valve and papillary muscles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73013\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73013 \">image 13</a>). The imaging transducer is then rotated to the vertical (90&ordm;) imaging plane to allow for visualization of the inferior and anterior left ventricular walls, mitral leaflets and left atrium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73013\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73013 \">image 13</a>). Slight anterior rotation of the probe will allow for visualization of the LVOT and aortic valve. This view may be especially helpful for Doppler assessment for aortic valve or LVOT gradients.</p><p>Further anterior rotation of the probe and rotation of the multiplane imaging transducer to 100 to 120&ordm; imaging plane allows for imaging of the right atrium, tricuspid valve, right ventricle, and right ventricular outflow tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61239\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61239 \">image 14</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastric imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advancement of the probe to a length of 42 to 45 cm from the incisors into the fundus of the stomach with maximum anteflexion results in an &quot;apical four or five chamber&quot; equivalent view of the heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62623\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62623 \">image 15</a>). From this orientation, continuous wave, pulsed, or color flow Doppler examination of the LVOT and aortic valve may be obtained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Thoracic aorta</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After all other images are obtained, attention is turned to the descending thoracic aorta, which is located posteriorly. For optimal visualization, the imaging frequency is increased to 5 MHz to permit improved spatial resolution of the adjacent aorta and the focal point is adjusted. After identifying the descending thoracic aorta in the horizontal (0&ordm;) imaging plane, the probe can be advanced during continuous imaging of the aorta to approximately 45 cm from the incisors or until the aortic lumen is no longer visible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79300\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79300 \">image 16</a>). The probe is then gently retracted during continuous imaging of the descending aorta. Annotations may be made on the screen as to the distance from the incisors at 2 to 3 cm intervals or the specific level of any abnormalities. </p><p>Transducer rotation to the vertical (90&ordm;) imaging plane allows for longitudinal imaging of the descending thoracic aorta. Color flow Doppler confirms the direction of blood flow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79300\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79300 \">image 16</a>). Further retraction is made with imaging in the horizontal (0&ordm;) imaging plane.</p><p>As the probe is withdrawn into the proximal esophagus (28 cm from the incisors), the transverse aorta may be seen as the aortic lumen appears to elongate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54091\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54091 \">image 17</a>). The probe is then gently retracted with slight flexion and anterior rotation to view the ascending aorta. Color flow Doppler demonstrates normal aortic flow and, in some cases, flow within the superior vena cava may be seen. Transducer rotation into the vertical (90&ordm;) plane at this level may allow for imaging of the pulmonary valve and main pulmonary artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80660\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80660 \">image 18</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While both transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) have a variety of clinical indications and applications, in most patients TEE provides superior image quality, particularly for posterior cardiac structures that are nearer to the esophagus and often less well visualized on TTE. Because of its moderately invasive nature, however, TEE is generally reserved for selected indications in which the potential benefits of making a diagnosis outweigh the risks associated with the procedure. For many indications, a TTE study is performed first as it may obviate the need for TEE <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> help to guide the TEE. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TTE remains the initial test of choice for most patients requiring an echocardiogram. However, TEE should be performed as the initial test in certain life-threatening situations or in situations where TTE is likely to be nondiagnostic, including (see <a href=\"#H9886539\" class=\"local\">'Indications for TEE'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Suspected acute aortic pathology (ie, dissection, transsection, intramural hematoma)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Suspected prosthetic valve dysfunction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Suspected complications of endocarditis (eg, fistula, abscess)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Evaluation for left <span class=\"nowrap\">atrial/left</span> atrial appendage thrombus in a patient with atrial <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrillation/atrial</span> flutter to facilitate clinical decision making regarding anticoagulation, cardioversion, or ablation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Evaluation of source of embolism in a young patient for whom a TEE would be performed if the TTE was normal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are few absolute contraindications to TEE examination. However, patients with altered mental status, tenuous cardiorespiratory status, recent or active esophageal tear or hemorrhage, coagulopathies, thrombocytopenia, esophageal stricture, Zenker's diverticulum, or severe cervical spine arthritis with reduced range of motion are at increased risk of TEE complications. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Safety of TEE examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious complications are extremely rare in patients undergoing TEE, having been estimated at less than 1 in 5000. While death during TEE has been rarely reported, complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, esophageal perforation, and methemoglobinemia are more likely to occur but only rarely are fatal. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Safety of TEE examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As with TTE examinations, we believe a complete TEE examination should include imaging of all cardiac chambers, valves and great vessels, regardless of the indication for the study, as patient condition permits. A standard comprehensive approach to imaging is recommended, but each individual study should be modified to reflect the specific clinical indication. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'The normal heart and great vessels'</a> above.) </p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-indications-complications-and-normal-views/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Frazin L, Talano JV, Stephanides L, et al.
