In reality, QT dispersion is a crude and approximate measure of a general abnormality of repolarization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Attempts to characterize and quantify the inhomogeneity of ventricular repolarization from the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) using precise mathematical methods, such as principal component analysis of the T wave, can be traced back to the 1960s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In clinical practice, however, the ECG assessment of ventricular repolarization has been limited to the measurement of the QT interval and its heart rate-corrected value (QTc) and to the description of the ST-T morphology, often using vague terms such as &quot;non-specific ST-T wave changes.&quot;</p><p>The QT interval duration varies between leads on the standard ECG, Frank orthogonal leads, and body surface potential maps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. These interlead differences, called QT interval dispersion or QT range, were proposed as an index of the spatial dispersion of the ventricular recovery times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This measurement was an attempt to distinguish between myocardium that is homogeneous from myocardium that displays inhomogeneity, which is accompanied by increased dispersion of the ventricular recovery times and prolongation of repolarization.</p><p>However, there has been much concern about the validity of the concept and the methodology of the measurement. Despite ongoing controversy, there are a number of reasonable conclusions about the reliability and applicability of the technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>]. The pathophysiology and measurement of QT dispersion will be reviewed here. The clinical applications of QT dispersion are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=qt-dispersion-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;QT dispersion: Clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF QT DISPERSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial concept that QT dispersion is an index of inhomogeneity was supported by the link between the dispersion of ventricular recovery times and the genesis of arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. It was generally believed that the standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) contained information about regional ventricular repolarization; thus, when increased QT dispersion was seen in cardiac diseases in which ventricular recovery times were known to be heterogeneous, it was assumed that increased QT dispersion was a direct reflection of the disparity of ventricular recovery times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The validity of this concept required evidence that monophasic action potentials (MAPs) correlated with body surface ECG features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Experimental and clinical studies have shown a significant correlation between the dispersion of ventricular recovery times, measured with MAPs, and QT dispersion and other electrocardiographic indices of repolarization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. These observations seemed to provide proof that QT dispersion directly reflects the dispersion of ventricular recovery times.</p><p>Despite the correlation between MAP and QT dispersion, it was suggested that QT dispersion could simply reflect variation in the duration of the spatial T loop projections onto the separate ECG leads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Two findings support this &quot;projection&quot; theory:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>QT dispersion can also be found in the so-called &quot;derived&quot; 12-lead ECG (a 12-lead ECG that is reconstructed from the X,Y,Z leads) and therefore contains no regional information; the QT dispersion in the originally recorded and in the &quot;derived&quot;12-lead ECG was surprisingly similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are significant differences in QT dispersion between patients with narrow and wide T loops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The difference between the QT interval in each of the six limb or six precordial leads and the maximum QT interval in these leads was greatest when the angle between the axis of the lead and the axis of the terminal part of the T loop was greatest.</p><p/><p>In addition to these observations, several other experimental studies did not show a significant correlation between directly measured dispersion of the ventricular recovery times and QT dispersion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p>A new ECG processing technique has been proposed to distinguish the T wave signals which represent the three-dimensional movement of the ECG dipole from the non-dipolar components; it is the latter that probably represents regional heterogeneity of myocardial repolarization. In one report, the power of the proportion of non-dipolar components within all T wave components, termed relative T wave residua (TWR), differed significantly among different clinical groups of patients, but were only weakly correlated with QT dispersion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>This was the first attempt to quantify the content of the local repolarization signals of the electrocardiogram. However, local repolarization signals seemed to constitute only a negligible proportion of the total repolarization content, from 0.03 percent of the total power in normal subjects to &lt;0.2 percent in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Their routine detection and quantification would probably require significant enhancement of the presently available signal-detection techniques.</p><p>Directly measured dispersion of ventricular recovery times and QT dispersion seem to be correlated without any definitive mechanistic link. General abnormalities of ventricular repolarization, including those leading to regional dispersion of recovery times, modify the spatial T wave loop. As a result of any abnormality, the variations in the projections of the loop onto the individual ECG leads may be increased and the terminal points of the T wave in the ECG tracings may become more difficult to be localized.</p><p>The effect of local dispersion of repolarization on the morphology of the T wave loop could explain the link between MAP recordings and QT dispersion. Thus, T wave loop dynamics and the variable projections of the loop onto individual ECG leads seem to be the true mechanism for QT dispersion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The link between T loop morphology and QT dispersion is an old idea. It has been long known that the more abnormal the T wave morphology is in ECG separate leads, the more difficult and less reliable the exact localization of the T wave offset in each lead becomes and the greater the likelihood of increased QT dispersion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Thus, variations of the T loop morphology may lead to both true variations in the length of the projections of the T loop onto the separate leads and increased measurement-related variations of the QT interval (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79885\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79885 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MEASUREMENT OF QT DISPERSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Theoretically, an accurate assessment of QT dispersion requires all 12 leads of the electrocardiogram (ECG) to be recorded simultaneously in order to avoid the effect of heart rate changes on QT dynamics. As a result, simultaneous 12-lead recordings (that is, simultaneous recording of the eight linearly independent leads of the 12-lead ECG) have been proposed as the gold standard for the measurement of QT dispersion. Since rate-related changes in the QT interval develop slowly, QT dispersion measurements based upon simultaneous recording of six or even only three QRS complexes during ectopic-free sinus rhythm is acceptable for practical purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This approach, however, has never been properly validated.</p><p>In addition to the original expression of QT dispersion as the range of QT interval duration in all measurable leads, many other measurement possibilities have been proposed. To mitigate the effect of outliers in the QT interval data, standard deviation of the QT interval duration in all leads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], coefficient of variation (SD of <span class=\"nowrap\">[QT/QT</span> average] x 100), and the so-called &quot;relative QT dispersion&quot; have been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, the range and standard deviation values correlate very closely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Reliability of QT measurements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Manual determination of the end of the T wave and, therefore, manual measurement of the QT interval are unreliable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. The main sources of error are specific morphological patterns, low T wave amplitude, and merging of the T wave with U wave or P wave.</p><p>Several algorithms for automatic determination of the end of the T wave have been proposed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The threshold methods localize the T wave offset as an interception of the T wave or one of its differentials with a threshold above the isoelectric line, usually expressed as a percentage of the T wave amplitude. With the threshold methods, the amplitude of the T wave influences the measurement results (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79885\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79885 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another group of algorithms determine the T wave offset as an interception between a line characterizing the slope of the descending part of the T wave with the isoelectric line, or a threshold line above it. The slope-characterizing line can be a tangent to the point of steepest slope, a straight line through the latter point and the peak of the T wave, a straight line fitted through a region containing the point of steepest slope and several samples of the T wave around it, and possibly other lines. With this method, the measured values of the QT interval depend upon the shape of the descending part of the T wave (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57025\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57025 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other algorithms for automatic QT measurement have been suggested, such as using the maximum curvature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The same tangent method applied to T waves with different morphology of the descending limb, or the same threshold method applied to T waves with different amplitudes, will lead to different measurement errors.</p><p/><p>In summary, the amplitude of the T wave strongly influences the reliability of both automatic and manual measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. Different measurement errors are seen when the same tangent method is applied to T waves with different amplitudes or when the same threshold method cuts off the same proportion of the final part of T waves with different amplitudes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect of U waves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal U wave, which is most prominently seen in leads V4-V6 on the surface ECG, is a small rounded deflection (&le;1 mm) following the T wave; it usually has the same polarity of the T wave. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-electrocardiographic-interpretation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of electrocardiographic interpretation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-st-and-t-wave-changes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: ST and T wave changes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The origin of the U wave is still disputed. The popular theory attributing the U wave to delayed repolarization of the His-Purkinje fibers has been superseded by the mechanoelectric coupling theory and the M-cell theory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>]. M-cells appear to be a hybrid between Purkinje and ventricular cells; their action potential prolongs disproportionately relative to the action potential of other ventricular myocardial cells in response to a slowing of rate or in response to drugs that prolong the action potential duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p>Regardless of the origin of the U wave, what is often interpreted as a pathologically augmented U wave or &quot;T-U complex&quot; is actually a prolonged biphasic T wave with an interrupted ascending or descending limb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. It is likely that the mechanisms responsible for the usual &quot;physiologic&quot; U wave are different from those leading to abnormal gross U waves, as seen in congenital and acquired long QT syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital long QT syndrome: Epidemiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is often difficult, if not impossible, to separate the end of a normal T wave from an obvious U wave. Various patterns in which the T and U waves merge have been described and methods for determining the end of the T wave when it is &quot;buried&quot; within the U wave have been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Depending upon the pattern of T-U wave merging, either the point of intersection of the tangent to the steepest point of the down slope and the isoelectric line, or the nadir between the T and the U wave is closer to the &quot;real&quot; T wave end.</p><p>Studies using manual QT measurements continue to refer to the tangent method without any justification, since the tangent method was proposed merely as an attempt to determine the true end of the T wave in cases of partial merging of T and U [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Manual measurement is even less reliable for certain patterns of T-U merging (eg, when the T wave is flat or inverted and the U wave augmented).</p><p>Repolarization patterns of complex morphology are frequently classified differently by different observers, leading to substantial variability of the measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/37,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,44,45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect of Q waves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dispersion of the Q wave may influence QT dispersion even though it is significantly smaller than the dispersion of T wave offset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. Traditional manual measurement, as well as those of some computer algorithms, assesses the Q wave onset separately in each lead, while other computer algorithms use a common, lead independent Q onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. This may account for part of the variability in the results obtained with different computer algorithms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Influence of heart rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many studies, including large prospective evaluations, used the so-called &quot;corrected QT (QTc) dispersion&quot; (ie, the dispersion of the QT intervals corrected for heart rate by some correction formula) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. The application of linear formulas for heart-rate correction of the QT interval results in identical values for QT dispersion and QTc dispersion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]; however, this is not true for the non-linear formulas.</p><p>Although experimental and clinical data have shown that the rate, rhythmicity, and the site of impulse origin can influence the dispersion of ventricular recovery times, this has not been shown for QT dispersion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>]. Clinical and experimental studies have failed to find significant correlation between heart rate and the dispersion of ventricular recovery times measured with MAPs or QT dispersion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. However, QT dispersion is increased with premature beats compared to normal sinus beats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].</p><p>The exact relation between the heart rate and dispersion of recovery times is still an unresolved issue. It is clear, however, that QT dispersion measured in the standard 12-lead ECG does not depend upon, and therefore should not be corrected for, the heart rate in the same way as the QT interval. Even more important, dispersion of the corrected QT intervals may differ among different clinically defined groups of patients simply due to application of the Bazett formula in the presence of different heart rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-st-and-t-wave-changes#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: ST and T wave changes&quot;, section on 'Prolonged Q-T interval'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Influence of the number of leads and the lead system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The number of measurable leads on a standard ECG influences the range of QT interval durations. Some researchers proposed a correction factor, dividing the QT interval range by the square root of the number of measurable ECG leads, the so-called &quot;adjusted QT dispersion&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. One study found that this formula led to a reasonable correction in normal ECGs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, while the correction led to maintenance of mean values, substantial individual errors were caused by omitting separate leads. As a result, it is not appropriate to compare results based upon QT interval values measured in ECGs that have used a different number of measurable leads.</p><p>The value of QT dispersion is maintained when measured in the six precordials instead of the 12 standard ECG leads. Other lead combinations, such as the orthogonal leads (X,Y,Z) or quasiorthogonal leads (I, aVF, V2), have also been studied. Although QT dispersion is decreased when a smaller number of leads is used for QT measurement, QT dispersion differences among various patients groups can still be detected when using the three leads most likely to contribute to QT dispersion (aVF, V1, and V4), the limb leads, the orthogonal leads, or the quasiorthogonal leads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/21,61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,61-63</a>].</p><p>It is clear that any lead combination can detect general abnormalities in repolarization (ie, in the morphology of the T loop) and translate them into increased values of QT dispersion. However, the likelihood of finding increased QT dispersion is increased when more projections of the T loop onto different leads with different axes are used. Unfortunately, as mentioned above, this does not directly translate into increased regional heterogeneity of recovery times. As a result, there seems to be little justification for continuing the quest for the perfect lead combination for the measurement of QT dispersion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Variability of QT dispersion measurement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is high interobserver and intraobserver variability of manually measured QT dispersion in normal subjects and patients with various cardiac diseases; relative errors have ranged from less than 5 percent to up to 25 to 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/25,44,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,44,64</a>]. In contrast, the relative error with manual measurement of the QT interval is less than 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Variations in the results can also be attributed to differences in the measurement method such as manual measurement with a caliper or ruler, application of a digitizing board with or without magnification, on screen measurement with electronic calipers, the noise level, and the paper speed at which the ECGs were recorded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/33,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,65</a>]. Even &quot;gold standard&quot; manual interval measurement, using a digitizing board, can produce interobserver variations corresponding to purely error-related QT dispersion &gt;40 ms or &gt;60 ms in 20 and 10 percent of observers, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>Reproducibility has not been superior with automatic methods for QT measurement. In one study, for example, the reproducibility from sequentially recorded ECGs of various QT dispersion indices measured with a down slope tangent method in healthy volunteers varied between 16 and 44 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Most available computer algorithms determine the end of the T wave either as an intersection between a tangent to the descending part of the T wave and the isoelectric line or as a point at which the T wave (or its differential) falls below a given threshold (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Reliability of QT measurements'</a> above)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Factors accounting for variability include signal processing options, the way in which the tangent is characterized, the definition of an isoelectric line, or the threshold level. Some software packages offer a large variety of parameter settings; in one, there are more than 100 programmable options for the T wave end localization.</p><p>Several studies have tried to validate automatic algorithms by comparing them to manual measurement by experienced ECG readers; the results were disappointing, as significant differences were seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/42,68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,68-70</a>]. One report, for example, investigated the agreement between automatic (downslope inflex tangent method) and manual QT interval measurements in normal subjects and patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. The agreement between the two methods for measurement of the QT interval, expressed as a correlation coefficient, was relatively poor, being lower in normal subjects than in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; not surprisingly, the agreement between automatic and manual measurement of QT dispersion was even worse.</p><p>A few reports have compared different algorithms for automatic QT measurement and substantial differences have been noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/67,71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,71,72</a>]. One study compared two threshold and two slope based techniques, and a validated manual measurement; the results of the mean measurements with different algorithms varied up to 62 ms, which was greater than the manual interobserver variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The threshold algorithm demonstrated the largest variability and its results depended on filtering and algorithm parameters.</p><p>A second study evaluated the differences between the down slope tangent method, using different number of samples around the inflex point for computation of the tangent, and the modifications of the threshold method were substantial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. The results varied significantly less with the different settings of the tangent method than with the threshold methods; there were differences of up to 60 ms in normal subjects and up to 70 ms in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Thus, only comparison of results obtained with the same automatic methods and with the same parameter setting is appropriate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMURAL DISPERSION AND THE TPE INTERVAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The interval from the peak to the end of the T wave has been referred to as the Tpe interval. This parameter has been evaluated as a surface electrocardiogram (ECG) measure of the transmural dispersion of ventricular repolarization and also of arrhythmic risk.</p><p>The ratio between the Tpe interval and the QT interval <span class=\"nowrap\">(Tpe/QT</span> ratio) has also been proposed as a noninvasive marker of the arrhythmic risk instead of the Tpe interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. While both the QT interval as well as the Tpe interval increase across different species with various body sizes as the body mass increases (possibly due to increase in TDR with increase in body mass), the <span class=\"nowrap\">Tpe/QT</span> ratio remains relatively constant within a narrow range of values between 0.17 and 0.23. In the same publication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>], the <span class=\"nowrap\">Tpe/QT</span> ratio was reported to be relatively stable when the heart varied between 60 and 100 beats per minute in 60 healthy individuals (range 0.15 to 0.25, median 0.21, mean 0.21&plusmn;0.003).</p><p>The T wave on the surface ECG results from transmural (ie, between subendocardial, subepicardial, and possibly midmyocardial M-cells), apicobasal, and transseptal voltage gradients as well as gradients between the left and right ventricle and posterior and anterior ventricular wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/74-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-78</a>]. The relative contribution of the various gradients to the inscription of the T wave on the surface ECG in the beating human heart, as opposed to experimental preparations (ie, left ventricular wedge preparations), is not established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>].</p><p>In left ventricular wedge preparations, the peak of the T wave coincides with the end of epicardial repolarization, whereas the end of the T wave coincides with the end of all ventricular repolarization, which occurs in the mid-myocardial M cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>]. Thus, the Tpe interval may provide a surface ECG approximation of transmural dispersion of repolarization. It has therefore been suggested that the Tpe interval could serve as an ECG marker of arrhythmic risk.</p><p>However, it is not clear that in beating hearts the Tpe is actually a reflection of the transmural dispersion of repolarization or of other, perhaps more complex, electrophysiologic phenomena. Tpe was initially evaluated in left ventricular wedge preparations that assess only transmural voltage gradients. Furthermore, it is not certain that the degree of transmural dispersion demonstrated in wedge preparations exists in live, beating hearts. Transmural dispersion of repolarization was measured directly using electrograms from five different transmural locations in a series of patients undergoing coronary artery surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. This failed to demonstrate any significant transmural repolarization gradients at pacing cycle length between 300 ms and 1500 ms and during global ischemia.</p><p>However, an experimental study with optically mapped AP durations in coronary-perfused scar-free posterior-lateral left ventricular free wall wedge preparations from human hearts with and without heart failure demonstrated significant transmural AP duration gradients during slow pacing in the non-failing hearts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. This is the first evidence for the presence of M-cells in the human heart.</p><p>Studies on intact dog hearts failed to show correlation between transmural dispersion of repolarization and the Tpe interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86</a>]. However, dispersion of repolarization of the whole heart (measured from various endocardial, epicardial and intramural sites of both ventricles) was highly correlated with the Tpe interval (p&lt;0.0005, r = 0.98), although the latter underestimated total repolarization time by approximately 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Endocardial and epicardial maps of both ventricles in pigs and demonstrated that the peak of the T wave coincide with the earliest (but not with epicardial) repolarization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p>One study used both a digital model of the left ventricular wall to simulate the effect of varying action potential durations on the timing of T peak and T end, as well as 1220 simultaneously recorded ECGs and vectorcardiograms (VCGs) from normal cases and patients with myocardial infarction or hypertrophy in order to explain the relationship between the T peak on the ECG and T loop of the VCG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. The digital model represented an apico-basal slice of the left ventricle, with the subendocardium, midmyocardium, and subepicardium having different action potential duration in accordance with the M-cell model. A marked shortening of the APs in the midmyocardium and subepicardium (simulating ischaemia) had no effect on the T peak, while simulated AP prolongation in the &quot;M-cell&quot; region widened the T wave and prolonged the QT interval but without displacement of the T peak. It was concluded that the Tpe interval does not represent transmural dispersion of AP duration. The phase relationship between the ECG and VCG showed that the T peak in the precordial leads was a derivative of the T loop, offering no additional information. </p><p>Prevailing evidence suggests that Tpe interval reflects more likely total dispersion of repolarization (apico-basal, transmural, global, etc.) rather than just transmural [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>An association between the Tpe interval or <span class=\"nowrap\">Tpe/QT</span> interval ratio and arrhythmic risk is supported by the following observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/87,90-97\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,90-97</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Association between increased Tpe or <span class=\"nowrap\">Tpe/QT</span> interval ratio and arrhythmic risk in LQTS syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/qt-dispersion-measurement-and-interpretation/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].

The relative contribution of different voltage gradients during repolarization (apico-basal, transmural, etc.) to the inscription of the T wave and the Tpe interval is not yet defined. The clinical significance of both Tpe and <span class=\"nowrap\">Tpe/QT</span> interval ratio remains unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8867566\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The measurement of QT dispersion (maximum QT interval minus minimum QT interval), originally proposed as an index of the spatial dispersion of ventricular recovery times, is an attempt to distinguish between myocardium that is homogeneous from myocardium that displays inhomogeneity, which is accompanied by increased dispersion of the ventricular recovery times and prolongation of repolarization. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The concept that QT dispersion is an index of inhomogeneity is supported by the link between the dispersion of ventricular recovery times and the genesis of arrhythmias, with some but not all studies having shown a significant correlation between the dispersion of ventricular recovery times, measured with monophasic action potentials, and QT dispersion and other electrocardiographic indices of repolarization. However, others have suggested that QT dispersion could simply reflect variation in the duration of the spatial T loop projections onto the separate electrocardiogram (ECG) leads. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology of QT dispersion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Theoretically, an accurate assessment of QT dispersion requires all 12 leads of the ECG to be recorded simultaneously in order to avoid the effect of heart rate changes on QT dynamics. As a result, simultaneous 12-lead recordings have been proposed as the gold standard for the measurement of QT dispersion. Since rate-related changes in the QT interval develop slowly, however, QT dispersion measurements based upon simultaneous recording of six or even only three QRS complexes during ectopic-free sinus rhythm is acceptable for practical purposes. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Measurement of QT dispersion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manual determination of the end of the T wave and, therefore, manual measurement of the QT interval are unreliable, with the main sources of error being morphological patterns, low T wave amplitude, and merging of the T wave with the U wave or P wave. Software that automatically detects the end of the T wave is necessary for this measurement, with the amplitude of the T wave strongly influencing the reliability of both automatic and manual measurements. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Reliability of QT measurements'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although experimental and clinical data have shown that the rate, rhythmicity, and the site of impulse origin can influence the dispersion of ventricular recovery times, this has not been shown for QT dispersion. Clinical and experimental studies have failed to find significant correlation between heart rate and the dispersion of ventricular recovery times measured with MAPs or QT dispersion. The exact relation between the heart rate and dispersion of recovery times is still an unresolved issue. However, QT dispersion measured in the standard 12-lead ECG does not depend upon, and therefore should not be corrected for, the heart rate in the same way as the QT interval. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Influence of heart rate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The interval from the peak to the end of the T wave has been referred to as the Tpe interval. The peak of the T wave coincides with the end of epicardial repolarization, whereas the end of the T wave coincides with the end of all ventricular repolarization, which occurs in the mid-myocardial M cells. This parameter has been evaluated as a surface ECG measure of the transmural dispersion of ventricular repolarization and also of arrhythmic risk. However, prevailing evidence suggests that the Tpe interval reflects more likely total dispersion of repolarization (apico-basal, transmural, global, etc.) rather than just transmural dispersion.
