Their recognition is important because of potential confusion with metastatic disease, paraneoplastic syndromes or comorbid neurologic disorders that do not require dose reduction or discontinuation. If the neurologic disorder is caused by the chemotherapy, discontinuation of the offending agent may prevent irreversible injury.</p><p>Here we discuss the neurologic complications associated with biologic agents, including both biological response modifiers and monoclonal antibodies. The neurological complications associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy agents are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-non-platinum-cancer-chemotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neurologic complications of non-platinum cancer chemotherapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-platinum-based-chemotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neurologic complications of platinum-based chemotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOLOGICAL RESPONSE MODIFIERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In more recent years there has been increasing interest in the use of biological response modifiers in cancer treatment. Frequently, they are used in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic agents (biochemotherapy).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Interferon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interferon alfa (IFNa) is useful for a number of cancers including hairy cell leukemia, Kaposi sarcoma, melanoma, multiple myeloma, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and low-grade lymphoma. However, IFNa is associated with a variety of substantial toxicities, which may limit the ability to deliver a full course of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cancer-treatment-with-biologic-agents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Frequent systemic toxicities include flu-like symptoms (myalgias, nausea, vomiting, arthralgias, fever, chills, and headache) and depression. The flu-like symptoms tend to be worse at the onset of therapy and usually improve with time.</p><p>Neurotoxicity tends to be dose-related. It is generally mild when low doses of IFNa are used, as in the adjuvant setting for patients with malignant melanoma. In a detailed evaluation of 37 such patients treated with IFNa, the most frequent neurotoxicity was tremor, observed in eight cases (22 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cancer-treatment-with-biologic-agents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Although these effects are usually reversible, a permanent dementia or persistent vegetative state may result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cancer-treatment-with-biologic-agents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>More commonly, patients develop a depressive syndrome over weeks to months. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are usually mild to moderate and typically resolve within two to three weeks of IFN discontinuation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cancer-treatment-with-biologic-agents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Cognitive impairments involving memory, processing speed, and executive functioning have also been reported in some studies of cancer patients receiving IFNa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cancer-treatment-with-biologic-agents/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>] but not in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cancer-treatment-with-biologic-agents/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>].</p><p>Rarely, IFNa has been associated with oculomotor palsy, sensorimotor neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cancer-treatment-with-biologic-agents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], myasthenia gravis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cancer-treatment-with-biologic-agents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], brachial plexopathy, an action tremor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cancer-treatment-with-biologic-agents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and polyradiculopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cancer-treatment-with-biologic-agents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>There are two available preparations of IFNa (2a and 2b), and their toxicities differ only slightly. The side effect profile of pegylated preparations of either IFNa, which have a longer half-life, are similar to those observed with standard IFNa-2a and IFNa-2b except that in some studies, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are slightly more severe.

In addition, somnolence, lethargy, confusion, and mental impairment may occur. Motor weakness may be seen at high doses (&gt;100 million units) and usually reverses within a few days.

Vertigo has been reported in 8 percent of patients with lymphoma treated with IFN.</p><p>Although most neurologic side effects of IFNa-2b are similar to IFNa-2a, a particularly high incidence of neuropsychiatric toxicity has been noted in some studies of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treated with recombinant IFNa-2b. In one study of 91 patients, one-fourth experienced grade 3 or 4 neuropsychiatric toxicity that affected daily functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cancer-treatment-with-biologic-agents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. All patients recovered upon withdrawal of IFNa.

In another study of 344 patients with CML, the reported incidence of grade 3 or 4 depression was not elevated (6 percent with recombinant IFNa-2b and 8 percent with pegylated IFNa-2b, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cancer-treatment-with-biologic-agents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Intrathecal interferon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrathecal administration of IFNa has been evaluated for the treatment of meningeal and brain tumors and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. An acute reaction (within hours of the first injection) consists of headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, and dizziness; these usually resolve over 12 to 24 hours. A severe encephalopathy develops in a significant number of patients within several days of the onset of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cancer-treatment-with-biologic-agents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This is dose-dependent and tends to be worse in patients who have received cranial irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cancer-treatment-with-biologic-agents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Beta and gamma interferon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical experience with interferon beta (IFNb, Betaseron) and interferon gamma (IFNg) treatment in oncology patients is limited compared with IFNa, but the overall toxicity profile with both agents appears to be similar to that of IFNa.

Administration of IL-2 directly into the tumor bed (with lymphokine-activated killer [LAK] cells) for the treatment of gliomas can cause significant cerebral edema, and neurotoxicity appears to be dose-limiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-cancer-treatment-with-biologic-agents/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>One case of grade 5 neurotoxicity has been reported in a patient treated with IL-2 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).

As a result, the use of TNF-a in patients with cancer is limited to isolated limb perfusion for patients with advanced sarcoma or melanoma.
