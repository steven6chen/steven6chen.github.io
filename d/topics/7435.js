Food poisoning is caused by eating food that contains germs, such as bacteria, viruses, or parasites. One of the most common causes of food poisoning is norovirus. Two examples of bacteria that are common causes of food poisoning are <em>Salmonella</em> and <em>E. coli</em>. Parasites include tiny worms that people can catch in some countries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481515310\"><span class=\"h1\">How can germs get in food?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Germs can get in food in different ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who are sick can spread their germs to the food they cook if they do not wash their hands before they touch the food.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Germs can live in or on food. If food is not washed or cooked enough, the germs in it or on it can infect people.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Germs from one food can get on another food. This can happen when a person uses the same cutting board or knife to prepare different foods.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481515317\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of food poisoning?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms can happen right after a person eats the food, or not until days or weeks later. Common symptoms of food poisoning include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea that can be watery or bloody</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p/><p>Other symptoms can include problems with the nervous system, such as blurry vision or feeling dizzy. But these problems are not as common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481515324\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink enough liquids so that your body does not get &quot;dehydrated.&quot; Dehydration is when the body loses too much water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat small meals that do not have a lot of fat in them</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest, if you feel tired</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481515331\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have severe belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannot eat or drink</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomit blood or have blood in your bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a fever higher than 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C)</p><p/><p>Young children and older adults with symptoms should make sure to see their doctor or nurse. That's because these groups can get dehydrated more easily.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481515338\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to have tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people do not need to have tests. But it's possible that your doctor will do tests to check if you are dehydrated or to figure out which germ caused your food poisoning. Your doctor might do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests on a sample of your bowel movement</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481515345\"><span class=\"h1\">How is food poisoning treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people do not need any treatment, because their symptoms will get better on their own. But some people need:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics &ndash; These medicines treat bacterial infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluids through an &quot;IV&quot; &ndash; An IV is a thin tube that goes into your vein. People with a lot of diarrhea or vomiting might need IV fluids to treat or prevent dehydration.</p><p/><p>You can try anti-diarrhea medicines as long as you do not have a fever or blood in your bowel movements. Do not take more than the label tells you to. Children should not take anti-diarrhea medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481515352\"><span class=\"h1\">Can food poisoning be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chance of getting food poisoning or spreading germs that can cause food poisoning by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Washing your hands after changing diapers, going to the bathroom, blowing your nose, touching animals, or taking out the trash</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staying home from work or school until you feel better (if you are sick)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paying attention to food safety. Tips include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Not drinking unpasteurized milk or foods made with it</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Washing fruits and vegetables well before eating them</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Keeping the refrigerator colder than 40&deg;F (4.4&deg;C) and the freezer below 0&deg;F (-18&deg;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cooking meat and seafood until well done</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cooking eggs until the yolk is firm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Washing hands, knives, and cutting boards after they touch raw food</p><p/><p>For more food safety tips to prevent food poisoning, see the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60529\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60529 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Pregnant women and people whose bodies have trouble fighting off infections can do more things to prevent getting food poisoning. If you are pregnant or have trouble fighting off infections, talk to your doctor or nurse about other ways to prevent getting food poisoning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481515359\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-adolescents-and-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in adolescents and adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=viral-gastroenteritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Viral gastroenteritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotavirus-infection-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rotavirus infection (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=enteric-typhoid-fever-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Enteric (typhoid) fever (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=campylobacter-infection-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Campylobacter infection (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=listeria-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Listeria (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-foodborne-illness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Food poisoning (foodborne illness) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-diarrhea-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acute diarrhea in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-diarrhea-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acute diarrhea in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-diarrhea-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic diarrhea in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 04, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
