It is the most common of the clinically indolent NHLs defined as those lymphomas in which survival of the untreated patient is measured in years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-the-hematopoietic-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of the hematopoietic neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment of FL depends on the stage of disease at presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 1</a>). Patients with limited (stage I) disease are candidates for radiation therapy, which is curative in a percentage of patients.</p><p>In contrast, patients with advanced (stage <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV)</span> disease are not cured with conventional therapies. Treatment of this latter group is more akin to the long-term management of a chronic disease with a focus on symptom control. Most patients with advanced disease will receive a number of different treatment modalities (eg, immunotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, radiation therapy) in various combinations, often separated by several years without active therapy.</p><p>The management of patients with stage II FL is more variable. We typically offer treatment similar to that used for advanced stage disease, while other clinicians offer treatment similar to that used for stage I disease. (See <a href=\"#H87719265\" class=\"local\">'Stage II FL'</a> below.)</p><p>Treatment also depends on the histologic grade of the tumor as determined by the number of centroblasts per high power field. The recommendations presented here pertain to patients with histologic grade 1, 2, or 3a FL; patients with grade 3b FL are treated with regimens used for other clinically aggressive lymphomas (eg, diffuse large B cell lymphoma). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Grade 3 FL'</a> below.)</p><p>The initial treatment of limited stage FL is discussed here. The initial treatment of advanced stage FL and the management of relapsed or refractory FL are presented separately, as are the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathologic features, diagnosis, and pathobiology of FL.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of advanced stage (III/IV) follicular lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, diagnosis, and prognosis of follicular lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-of-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology of follicular lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pretreatment evaluation both determines the extent and aggressiveness of disease and provides information about the individual's performance status and comorbidities that are likely to have an impact on treatment options.</p><p>In addition to a history and physical examination, the following are part of our pre-treatment evaluation of patients with FL:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review of the pathologic evaluation to confirm the adequacy of the histologic sample, confidence in the diagnosis, and assigned histologic grade.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies include a complete blood count with differential, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes, lactate dehydrogenase, and serologic testing for hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral bone marrow biopsy is performed prior to the initiation of therapy.

Since FL is a typically FDG-avid tumor, involved areas should show activity on PET scan allowing for the identification of those unlikely to be cured by RT due to more widespread disease. CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is a less expensive alternative for patients who will be treated with systemic therapy.

In general, it is far more important to attain accurate staging information and correct or control comorbidities than it is to immediately start therapy. Although oncologic emergencies and severe disease-related complications are more common in the clinically aggressive and highly aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes, the physician must always be alert to their potential presence and be prepared to deal with them urgently and effectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Oncologic emergencies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19679373\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to patients with limited stage <span class=\"nowrap\">(I/II)</span> FL depends on the histologic grade, stage, and location of disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F115334\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115334 \">algorithm 1</a>). This approach is generally consistent with that of major guidelines, including those from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (<a href=\"https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/b-cell.pdf&amp;token=YZvoiLxJiu7+5RG1c2d6vYaYQQffR1welAAbv+Ben8xyfKRtndMccopuR0IrCtQ9vRSTM/aeayJL4CIjtG6kT1/SaFuq3aBrAMFiY1ddzo0=&amp;TOPIC_ID=4741\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCCN</a>), the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), and the British Society for Haematology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage I FL; grades 1, 2, or 3a &ndash; We prefer treatment with radiation therapy (RT) administered with curative intent as long as all involved sites can be contained within a radiation field with minimal toxicity. If RT is not feasible, we prefer initial observation. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy (RT)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Given the relatively low dose of radiation needed for cure, there are few areas that are associated with significant radiation toxicity. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage II FL; grades 1, 2, or 3a &ndash; We prefer treatment similar to that used for advanced stage FL. Other clinicians offer radiation to a subset of these patients. (See <a href=\"#H87719265\" class=\"local\">'Stage II FL'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 3b &ndash; We prefer treatment with regimens used for other clinically aggressive lymphomas such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Grade 3 FL'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>While the recommendations presented here apply to most patients with FL, modifications to this approach are necessary when FL arises in children, in certain extranodal locations (eg, primary intestinal FL, primary cutaneous FL), and when FL-type cells are found incidentally without true lymph node involvement (ie, &quot;in-situ&quot; FL). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Special situations'</a> below.)</p><p>Only approximately 15 to 30 percent of patients with FL will present with limited stage disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. As such, there have been few prospective trials of therapy in this population and most of the data on this subgroup of patients come from retrospective analyses. Interpretation of these studies is complicated by the rare occurrence of spontaneous complete remissions. Spontaneous partial remissions occur in approximately 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The following bullet points summarize the outcomes and toxicities with the main management approaches. More detailed information is provided in the sections that follow.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; RT results in 10-year overall survival (OS) rates of 60 to 80 percent; median survival is approximately 19 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Some patients may have a prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) with RT alone. Short- and long-term toxicities associated with RT are dependent on the site of disease, radiation field, and dose. Limited studies suggest adjuvant therapy that incorporates <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> may prolong PFS but does not appear to improve survival after local RT. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy (RT)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A retrospective analysis reported a longer PFS among patients treated with RT and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> when compared with those treated with RT alone; however, the follow-up was shorter in patients treated with rituximab and RT, and there were no differences in OS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Preliminary data from a randomized trial comparing RT alone versus RT plus chemotherapy reported superior PFS in the combined modality arm, although there was no apparent survival advantage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observation &ndash; Observation is a reasonable alternative to RT if significant morbidity is expected from RT based on the location of the tumor or if the patient chooses against RT. Patients who choose this approach are expected to progress sooner than those who select immediate therapy. By postponing treatment, the patient avoids potential toxicity; however, the increased size of the tumor at the time of progression may also limit treatment options at the time of progression. This approach may be most appropriate for the many stage II patients who are not ideal candidates for RT due to the location of their disease and expected toxicities. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Observation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemoimmunotherapy or immunotherapy &ndash; Chemoimmunotherapy or immunotherapy, with or without RT, such as that used for patients with advanced stage FL, is best reserved for the rare patient who presents with bulky (&gt;5 cm) limited stage FL. With this approach, 10-year OS and PFS rates were 80 and 72 percent, in one case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Short-term toxicities depend on the regimen used but usually include immunosuppression, infections, gastrointestinal distress, and infusion-related reactions. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Systemic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Despite evidence demonstrating the potential for cure, observational studies suggest only a minority (27 percent) of patients with stage I disease treated in the United States receives RT as a single modality treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/9,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15</a>]. Instead, patients commonly receive initial treatment with immunochemotherapy (28 percent), immunochemotherapy plus RT (13 percent), or single agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (12 percent), or are observed until progression (17 percent). These observational studies suggest differences in PFS rates with these different treatment strategies but have not demonstrated a difference in survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy (RT)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1716547296\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy and toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observational studies with long-term follow-up suggest that approximately half of patients presenting with stage I FL can be cured with RT. These studies reported 10-year OS rates of 60 to 80 percent, with 10-year relapse-free survival rates of 45 to 60 percent, and median survival of approximately 15 to 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/11,16-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16-23</a>].</p><p>Outcomes may be even better with modern staging and radiation protocols. The historical series described above included patients treated several decades ago, mostly before the availability of modern imaging for staging, and were primarily treated with outdated radiation fields, doses, and techniques. Patients identified as having early stage FL using more rigorous staging techniques have superior PFS than those identified with less rigorous staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a multicenter retrospective study of patients staged with <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> and treated with definitive RT, estimated five-year failure-free progression rates were 74 percent among the 254 patients with stage I FL and 48 percent among the 56 patients with stage II FL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The favorable results compared with historical series may in part be due to stage migration associated with more accurate staging.</p><p>Short- and long-term toxicities associated with RT are dependent on the site of disease, radiation field, and dose. Contemporary RT strategies that use smaller radiation fields, conformal techniques with daily image guidance, and lower doses have been able to maintain local disease control rates and are expected to result in less toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Given the relative low dose of radiation needed for cure, there are few areas that are associated with significant radiation toxicity.</p><p>The following bullets describe large database analyses that have compared the outcomes of patients with early stage FL treated with and without RT. These studies must be interpreted with caution due to potential unobserved confounders and potential selection bias.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database identified 6568 patients with stage I or stage II FL diagnosed from 1973 to 2004, 34 percent of whom were initially treated with RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. When compared with those who did not receive RT, patients who received initial RT had superior rates of disease-specific survival at 5 (90 versus 81 percent), 10 (79 versus 66 percent), 15 (68 versus 57 percent), and 20 (63 versus 51 percent) years. OS rates were also superior among patients who received initial RT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis of the National Cancer Database (NCDB) that included 35,961 patients with stage I or stage II FL, 10-year survival rates were higher among patients who received RT versus those who did not (68 versus 54 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. An association with improved survival persisted on multivariable analysis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87718790\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation field</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend involved-site RT as per guidelines published by the International Lymphoma Radiation Oncology Group (ILROG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>When RT is given as a single modality with curative intent, the clinical target volume (CTV) definition is more generous than in the setting of combined modality therapy in which microscopic disease is addressed by systemic therapy. As an example, in a patient with stage I FL of the groin, the CTV should include adjacent vessels that contain lymphatic tissues, as well as adjacent nodes that may harbor microscopic disease. For extranodal FL, organ involvement may be multifocal and limitations in imaging sensitivity may mandate inclusion of the whole organ as part of the CTV.</p><p>The CTV definition should be assessed on a case-by-case basis and take into account the quality and accuracy of imaging, potential changes in volume since staging imaging, patterns of the disease spread and likelihood of microscopic involvement of neighboring structures. The expansion from CTV to planning target volume (PTV) allows for uncertainties in planning or treatment delivery and is designed to ensure that the RT dose is actually delivered to the CTV. This expansion also needs to be individualized, depending on the immobilization device, body site, and patient cooperation. In general, the CTV to PTV expansion ranges from 0.5 cm to 1 cm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87718783\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend a radiation dose of 24 Gy in 2 Gy fractions in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A higher dose can be considered for patients with bulky disease but should not exceed 30 Gy.</p><p>A phase 3 study evaluating the optimal radiation dose on local control randomly assigned radiation at lower doses (24 Gy in 12 fractions) or higher doses (40 to 45 Gy in 20 to 23 fractions) for 261 sites of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (60 percent FL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The overall response rate was 93 percent. At a median follow-up of 5.6 years, lower dose radiation resulted in similar rates of in-field progression (hazard ratio [HR] 1.09, 95% CI 0.76-1.56), PFS (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.73-1.75), and OS (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.66-1.41).</p><p>Another phase 3 randomized, noninferiority trial compared 4 Gy in two fractions versus 24 Gy in 12 fractions as curative (40 percent) or palliative treatment of 614 sites of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (86 percent FL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The lower radiation dose was less toxic. However, after a median follow-up of 26 months, lower dose radiation resulted in a higher rate of local progression (22 versus 7 percent). This study demonstrates an unacceptably high rate of progression with low dose radiation. The low dose approach is therefore not appropriate in the setting of limited stage disease treated with curative intent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Observation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observation with treatment at the time of progression (ie, watch and wait) is an acceptable treatment option for patients with limited stage FL. This is a particularly attractive option if significant morbidity is expected from RT based on the location of the tumor or if the patient chooses against RT.</p><p>The following are the largest studies that have evaluated this approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective analysis of 43 patients with stage IA or IIA FL observed for at least three months reported a median OS of 19.1 years and estimated survival rates at 5, 10, and 20 years of 97, 85, and 22 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. After a median follow-up of 7.2 years, 27 patients (63 percent) had not yet required treatment; the median time to treatment for the other 16 patients was 22 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another retrospective analysis of 43 consecutive patients with stage I FL with no residual tumor following the initial diagnostic surgery included 26 patients who were observed initially and 17 who underwent involved-field RT with or without chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. After a median follow-up of 6.3 years, 13 of the 26 patients had not relapsed after observation alone. Six had relapsed locally at a median of 4.2 years from diagnosis, all of whom achieved a second complete remission with RT. Seven relapsed in a distant location after a median of one year. Of the patients who underwent initial therapy, none relapsed locally, but seven relapsed at distant sites.</p><p/><p>These retrospective studies suggest that a percentage of a highly selected patient population may be spared the morbidities associated with RT if observation is used as an initial approach. However, given the potential for cure with RT, we reserve observation for patients who would require RT to areas with high complication rates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic therapy with immunotherapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>) or chemoimmunotherapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bendamustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bendamustine</a> plus rituximab) is generally reserved for patients with symptomatic stage II, III, or IV FL.

Those with &gt;15 centroblasts per high power field are categorized as grade 3. Grade 3 FL is subdivided into grade 3a, in which centrocytes are present, and grade 3b, in which there are solid sheets of centroblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Although controversial, differences in molecular genetics as well as clinical behavior suggest that FL grade 3a is an indolent disease and 3b a more aggressive one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>].</p><p>FL grade 3b is often referred to as follicular large cell lymphoma. In contrast to lower grade FLs, this histologic variant has a lesser tendency to involve the bone marrow or peripheral blood and often presents with larger lymphoid masses. Although the follicular architecture is preserved, the clinical presentation, behavior, and outcome with treatment more closely approximates that of DLBCL.</p><p>Patients with grade 3b FL commonly present with a more clinically aggressive course, which may resemble histologic transformation. If histologic transformation is suspected, repeat biopsy is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Histologic transformation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87719265\"><span class=\"h2\">Stage II FL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with stage II FL, we prefer a management approach similar to that used for advanced stage FL. Other clinicians offer radiation therapy (RT) to a subset of these patients in which the disease can be encompassed by a reasonable radiation field (eg, stage II disease with groin and ipsilateral iliac involvement). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of advanced stage (III/IV) follicular lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with stage II FL have been included in most studies of RT in limited stage disease. Studies using contemporary radiation practices suggest that patients with stage II FL are unlikely to be cured with RT. As an example, an international multicenter retrospective study, presented in abstract form only, evaluated the outcomes of 310 patients with limited stage FL who underwent RT administered with curative intent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The percentage of patients free from progression at five years was lower among those with stage II disease (48 versus 74 percent).</p><p>Subset analyses of trials of RT for limited stage FL have also identified tumor bulk as a marker of worse outcome following RT alone. As an example, in a retrospective analysis of 237 patients with stage I or II FL treated with RT with curative intent, rates of progression-free survival at 10 years decreased with increasing tumor volume (77, 50, and 28 percent for patients with completely excised, &lt;5 cm lesions, and &ge;5 cm lesions, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, rates of overall survival at 10 years did not differ with tumor volume (76, 62, and 78 percent, respectively). It is unknown whether increasing therapy intensity for patients with bulky disease would improve outcomes in this population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87719229\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrafollicular neoplasia (&quot;in-situ&quot;) FL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrafollicular neoplasia is a pathologic diagnosis used to describe the identification of follicles, typically several in number, that have a high content of BCL2-positive B cells within a lymph node that otherwise lacks the diagnostic features of FL. Such patients are not considered as having a diagnosis of FL. Following removal of the involved lymph node, these patients should be followed clinically for evidence of progression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-follicular-lymphoma#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, diagnosis, and prognosis of follicular lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Intrafollicular neoplasia'</a>.)</p><p>Little is known regarding the natural history of patients with this finding who have no evidence of FL on further evaluation. A retrospective analysis of 21 cases of in situ FL with a median follow-up of 41 months reported only one case of progression to disseminated FL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87718797\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary intestinal FL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary intestinal FL is a variant of FL characterized by lymphomatous disease pathologically consistent with FL confined to the intestine without lymph node involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. &quot;Duodenal-type follicular lymphoma&quot; is considered a unique clinicopathologic entity in the World Health Organization classification of lymphoid neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p>Given the potential toxicity of RT and the indolent nature of primary intestinal FL, we suggest a watch-and-wait strategy rather than initial RT. For those who choose RT, techniques that avoid whole abdominal radiation are preferred.</p><p>Primary intestinal FL is a rare entity initially described in small case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/40,42-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,42-49</a>]. The largest series included 63 patients with stage I FL of the small intestine diagnosed by endoscopic biopsy and followed for a median of 77 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Four general treatment strategies were used:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Watch and wait &ndash; Of the 24 patients managed with serial endoscopies, 7 experienced a complete remission (CR), 17 had stable disease, and 2 developed nodal FL.

None of these patients developed symptoms directly related to gastrointestinal involvement requiring intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; All 19 patients treated with local radiation with a focal dose of 30 to 45.3 Gy and abdominal bath of 24.5 to 30 Gy attained a CR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> monotherapy &ndash; Of the five patients who received rituximab alone, four had a CR, and one had stable disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy with or without radiation &ndash; All eight patients who were treated with chemotherapy with or without radiation attained a CR. Three developed duodenal relapse.</p><p/><p>In another series of 21 patients with duodenal FL treated with involved-site RT with inclusion of the entire duodenum in the target volume, treated to a median dose of 30.6 Gy, the three-year overall survival, relapse-free survival, and local control rates were 95, 79, and 100 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Radiation of the small bowel is associated with chronic radiation enteritis manifested by malabsorption and diarrhea. This toxicity can be minimized by using a technique that avoids whole abdominal irradiation. For this technique, a radiopaque clip is placed by endoscopy at the location of the tumor and this clip is then used to identify and treat involved bowel plus a margin of normal tissue to 24 Gy.

This evaluation includes a history, physical examination, and laboratory studies (complete blood count with differential, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes, and lactate dehydrogenase). In addition, a whole body <span class=\"nowrap\">FDG-PET/CT</span> is performed six to eight weeks after the completion of chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy and 8 to 12 weeks after radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">FDG-PET/CT</span> is the preferred modality as it provides a more precise estimation of disease burden than CT alone and may provide prognostic information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">FDG-PET/CT</span> is interpreted using the Deauville score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F108973\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108973 \">table 4</a>), which visually compares the FDG avidity of suspected disease in relation to FDG uptake in the mediastinal blood pool and liver as an internal control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Disease response incorporates information gathered from the history, physical, and imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97480\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97480 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. While the goal of treatment is a complete remission, many patients with advanced disease only obtain a partial remission. Patients who fail to obtain a partial remission have refractory disease.

The frequency and extent of these visits depends on the comfort of both the patient and physician. There have been no prospective, randomized trials comparing various schedules of follow-up.</p><p>Our approach to patient surveillance is to schedule patient visits every three months during the first year and then every three to six months thereafter. At these visits we perform a history and physical examination, complete blood count, chemistries, and lactate dehydrogenase. The role of routine imaging in the longitudinal follow-up of asymptomatic patients after response assessment is uncertain, and routine imaging in this population is discouraged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There is <strong>no</strong> role for PET imaging in disease surveillance.</p><p>Relapsed disease can be suggested by findings on the physical examination and changes on imaging studies, but can only be confirmed by biopsy. Biopsy also evaluates for histologic transformation to more aggressive disease. As such, a biopsy should always be obtained to document relapsed disease before proceeding to further therapy. The treatment of relapsed FL is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients treated for FL require surveillance for potential long-term toxicities.
