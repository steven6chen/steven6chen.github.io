Some people will also need a medication to lower their low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (&quot;bad cholesterol&quot;) or triglycerides.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If medication is needed, a statin drug should be included whenever possible. The statin drugs have been shown to decrease the future risk of heart attacks, strokes, and death in people with diabetes who are over age 40 years, even when cholesterol levels are normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The initiation of statins should be based upon cardiovascular risk rather than an LDL cholesterol level. Statins are recommended for anyone with clinical cardiovascular disease or over age 40 years, regardless of baseline lipid levels. For patients without clinical cardiovascular disease and under age 40 years, statins can be added (in addition to lifestyle intervention) if there are multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors. The intensity of statin therapy can be adjusted based upon side effects, tolerability, and LDL cholesterol levels. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that people with diabetes have an LDL cholesterol level less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Some studies suggest lowering LDL even further, to 70 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.81 to 2.07 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-and-lipids-hyperlipidemia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High cholesterol and lipids (hyperlipidemia) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspirin (81 to 100 mg per day) is recommended for anyone with diabetes who already has or is at increased risk of cardiovascular disease.</p><p/><p>Some studies have shown that lowering glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels with specific diabetes drugs may also reduce risk for cardiovascular disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTROLLING BLOOD SUGAR IN DIABETES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The long-term complications of diabetes are caused by the effect of high blood sugar levels on blood vessels. Two important studies, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) in patients with type 1 diabetes and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) in patients with type 2 diabetes, found that people with lower blood sugar levels had fewer complications than those with higher values.</p><p>Thus, keeping blood sugars close to normal can help prevent the long-term complications of diabetes mellitus. However, there are some risks associated with tight control, particularly an increased risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H818612012\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring blood sugar levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monitoring blood sugar with fingersticks at home can indicate how well diabetes is controlled and serves as a guide to adjusting therapy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=self-monitoring-of-blood-glucose-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Self-monitoring of blood glucose in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). For most people, a target for fasting blood sugar and for blood sugar levels before each meal is 80 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.4 to 6.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L);</span> however, these targets may need to be individualized.</p><p>A blood test called A1C (glycated hemoglobin) is also used to monitor blood sugar control; the result provides an average of blood sugar levels during the previous one to three months. An A1C of 7 percent or less is recommended; this corresponds to an average blood sugar of 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (8.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76310\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76310 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The A1C target may be somewhat higher in people who are older or who have conditions that increase the risks associated with hypoglycemia. Even small decreases in the A1C lower the risk of diabetes-related complications to some degree.</p><p>The combination of A1C and fingerstick blood sugars provides information about the average and daily blood sugar levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 1 diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood sugar control in type 1 diabetes requires some form of insulin, which can be given with insulin injections or an insulin pump. Most health care providers recommend intensive insulin therapy, which requires frequent blood sugar monitoring in addition to frequent injections or use of an insulin pump. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-1-insulin-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 1: Insulin treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Intensive insulin therapy increases the risk of low blood sugar, is more expensive than traditional insulin therapy, and requires that the person monitor their blood sugar levels, diet, and activities. Some people who use intensive insulin therapy gain weight, although regular exercise and controlling the amount eaten can prevent weight gain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-low-blood-sugar-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 2 diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With type 2 diabetes, it is sometimes possible to control blood sugar levels with lifestyle changes, often in combination with oral medications. Insulin injections may be needed when a person is first diagnosed or later in the course of treatment. Most people with type 2 diabetes who take insulin require only one or two injections per day. In 2015, an inhaled form of insulin became available for clinical use. Inhaled insulins have not been shown to be effective in reducing A1C levels to the goal of less than 7 percent that is often recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetes-mellitus-type-2-insulin-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Diabetes mellitus type 2: Insulin treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EYE COMPLICATIONS IN DIABETES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regular eye examinations are essential for detecting eye complications (called retinopathy) at an early stage, when the condition can be monitored and treated to preserve vision.</p><p>An eye exam should include dilating the pupils (with medicated eye drops) to completely examine the retina. Unless the pupils are medicated, they contract in response to light, making it impossible to view the entire retina. In some people with retinopathy, photographs of the retina will be taken to monitor the changes. This examination should be performed by a doctor who specializes in the eyes (called an ophthalmologist or optometrist).</p><p>The risk of diabetic retinopathy varies with the type and duration of diabetes and with other life events. Thus, the screening guidelines differ from one person to another.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 1 diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with type 1 diabetes should have an eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist beginning five years after they are diagnosed with diabetes, although screening is usually not necessary before puberty. People who have difficulty with their vision or who require glasses or contacts may need to be seen sooner. The frequency of subsequent examinations will depend upon the results of the initial exam. An eye exam is usually recommended every one to two years after the initial examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 2 diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with type 2 diabetes should have an eye examination by an ophthalmologist or optometrist when they are first diagnosed with diabetes. The reason for this is that blood sugar levels often increase over a period of several years before the person is diagnosed. Eye complications can develop during this time and often have no symptoms. Having an eye examination soon after diagnosis can help to determine if there are eye complications, the extent or severity of the complications, and if treatment is needed.</p><p>The frequency of subsequent exams will depend upon the results of the initial examination. An eye exam is usually recommended every one to two years after the initial examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">FOOT CARE WITH DIABETES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetes can decrease the blood supply to the feet and damage the nerves that carry sensation. These changes put the feet at risk for developing potentially serious complications such as ulcers. Foot complications are very common among people with diabetes, and may go unnoticed until the condition is severe. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-neuropathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Diabetic neuropathy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Self-exam</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with diabetes should examine their feet every day. It is important to examine all parts of the feet, especially the area between the toes. Look for broken skin, ulcers, blisters, areas of increased warmth or redness, or changes in callus formation; a health care provider should be notified if any of these changes are found. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foot-care-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Foot care in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This examination can be a part of the daily bathing or dressing routine. It may be necessary to use a mirror to see the bottoms of the feet clearly. Anyone who is unable to reach their feet or see them completely, even with the help of a mirror, should have someone else (such as a spouse or other family member) assist with the examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical exam</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During a routine medical visit, the clinician will check the blood flow and sensation in the feet. In people with type 1 diabetes, annual foot examinations should begin five years after diagnosis. In people with type 2 diabetes, annual foot exams should begin at the time of diagnosis.</p><p>During a foot examination, the clinician will look for changes such as ulcers, cold feet, thin skin, bluish skin color, and skin breaks associated with athlete's foot. The clinician will also test the sensation in the feet to determine if it is normal or diminished. People with decreased sensation are at risk for foot injuries that can go unnoticed due to lack of pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">KIDNEY COMPLICATIONS IN DIABETES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetes can alter the normal function of the kidneys. A urine test that measures the amount of protein (albumin) in the urine can determine if diabetes is affecting the kidney's filtering action. Microscopic amounts of albumin in the urine (microalbuminuria) can be an early indicator of diabetes-related kidney complications (called nephropathy). The amount of albumin in the urine can also help the provider determine if nephropathy is worsening. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-in-the-urine-proteinuria-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Protein in the urine (proteinuria) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Urine screening tests should begin in people with type 1 diabetes approximately five years after diagnosis and, in people with type 2 diabetes, at the time of diagnosis. If the test shows that there is protein in the urine, tight blood sugar and lipid (cholesterol and triglyceride) control are recommended.</p><p>A blood pressure medication (an angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) is generally recommended if albuminuria does not improve, even if the blood pressure is normal. People with elevated blood pressure and albuminuria are also treated with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. These medications decrease the amount of protein in the urine and can prevent or slow the progression of diabetes-related kidney disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPERTENSION AND RELATED COMPLICATIONS IN DIABETES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with diabetes have hypertension (high blood pressure). Although high blood pressure causes few symptoms, it has two negative effects: it stresses the cardiovascular system and speeds the development of diabetic complications of the kidney and eye. A health care provider can diagnose high blood pressure by measuring blood pressure on a regular basis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, experts recommend a blood pressure below <span class=\"nowrap\">130/80</span> mmHg for adults with diabetes. If you need to lower your blood pressure, your doctor will probably recommend lifestyle changes such as weight loss, exercise, decreasing the amount of salt in your diet, quitting smoking, and cutting back on alcohol. Some people also need to take medications to keep their blood pressure within the goal range. Your doctor can talk to you about the benefits and risks of the different treatment options.

Controlling blood sugar levels <strong>before</strong> and <strong>during</strong> pregnancy decreases the risk of many complications in both the mother and the baby.
