CD may involve the entire gastrointestinal tract from mouth to the perianal area:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 80 percent of patients have small bowel involvement, usually in the distal ileum, with one-third of patients having ileitis exclusively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 50 percent of patients have ileocolitis, which refers to involvement of both the ileum and colon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 20 percent have disease limited to the colon. In contrast to rectal involvement in patients with ulcerative colitis, one-half of CD patients with colitis have sparing of the rectum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately one-third of patients have perianal disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 5 to 15 percent have predominant involvement of the mouth or gastroduodenal area, while fewer patients have involvement of the esophagus and proximal small bowel. This topic review will discuss the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and natural history of CD. The management of this disorder is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-medical-management-of-mild-low-risk-crohn-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the medical management of mild (low risk) Crohn disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-medical-management-of-high-risk-adult-patients-with-moderate-to-severe-crohn-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of medical management of high-risk, adult patients with moderate to severe Crohn disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12689029\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of Crohn disease (CD) are more variable than those of ulcerative colitis. Patients can have symptoms for many years prior to diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Fatigue, prolonged diarrhea with abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever, with or without gross bleeding, are the hallmarks of CD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12689036\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Crampy abdominal pain is a common manifestation of CD, regardless of disease distribution. The transmural nature of the inflammatory process results in fibrotic strictures. These strictures often lead to repeated episodes of small bowel, or less commonly colonic, obstruction. A patient with disease limited to the distal ileum frequently presents with right lower quadrant pain. Occasionally, patients will have no clinical manifestations of CD until luminal narrowing causes constipation and early signs of obstruction with abdominal pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12689043\"><span class=\"h2\">Diarrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diarrhea is a common presentation, but often fluctuates over a long period of time. A history of prolonged diarrhea without bleeding but with other features suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (eg, skin, eye, or joint problems, or a family history of IBD) should suggest the diagnosis of CD. Diarrhea associated with CD may have multiple causes, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive fluid secretion and impaired fluid absorption by inflamed small or large bowel</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bile salt malabsorption due to an inflamed or resected terminal ileum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steatorrhea related to loss of bile salts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12689050\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although stools frequently reveal the presence of microscopic levels of blood (eg, positive guaiac or immunochemical test), gross bleeding is less frequent than in ulcerative colitis. An exception to this are some patients with Crohn colitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12689057\"><span class=\"h2\">Fistulas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transmural bowel inflammation is associated with the development of sinus tracts. Sinus tracts that penetrate the serosa can give rise to fistulas. Penetration of the bowel wall most often presents as an indolent process, and not as an acute abdomen.</p><p>Fistulas are tracts or communications that connect two epithelial-lined organs. Common sites for fistulas connect the intestine to bladder (enterovesical), to skin (enterocutaneous), to bowel (enteroenteric), and to the vagina (enterovaginal).</p><p>In a population-based study of patients with CD, the cumulative risk of developing a fistula was 33 and 50 percent after 10 and 20 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Up to 45 percent of patients develop a fistula before diagnosis of CD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestation of the fistula depends upon the area of involvement adjacent to the diseased bowel segment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enteroenteric fistulas may be asymptomatic or present as a palpable mass</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enterovesical fistulas lead to recurrent urinary tract infections, often with multiple organisms, and to pneumaturia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fistulas to the retroperitoneum may lead to psoas abscesses or ureteral obstruction with hydronephrosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enterovaginal fistulas may present with passage of gas or feces through the vagina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enterocutaneous fistulas can cause bowel contents to drain to the surface of the skin</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12689064\"><span class=\"h2\">Phlegmon/abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All sinus tracts do not lead to fistulas. Sinus tracts may present as a phlegmon, a walled off inflammatory mass without bacterial infection that may be palpable on physical examination. Ileal involvement is suggested by a mass in the right lower quadrant.</p><p>Some sinus tracts lead to abscess formation and an acute presentation of localized peritonitis with fever, abdominal pain and tenderness. Diffuse peritonitis due to abscess perforation is a rare but recognized complication of CD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12689071\"><span class=\"h2\">Perianal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms and signs related to perianal disease occur in more than one-third of patients with CD and may dominate the clinical picture. These include perianal pain and drainage from large skin tags, anal fissures, perirectal abscesses, and anorectal fistulas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perianal complications of Crohn disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12689078\"><span class=\"h2\">Malabsorption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bile acids are normally absorbed by specific receptors in the distal ileum. Bile salt malabsorption occurs when more than 50 to 60 cm of terminal ileum is diseased or resected. Unabsorbed bile salts enter the colon resulting in a secretory or &quot;bile salt&quot; diarrhea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of malabsorption&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Increased synthesis partially compensates for the loss of bile salts. However, compensation is inadequate with disease or resection of more than 100 cm of the terminal ileum, leading to depletion of the bile salt pool and fat malabsorption. Thus:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A watery diarrhea may result related to the effects of bile acids on colonic water and electrolyte absorption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steatorrhea is possible with a more severe degree of bile acid malabsorption, since the concentration of bile acids required for micelles for fat absorption is impaired.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steatorrhea may also result from bacterial overgrowth from small bowel strictures, enterocolonic fistulas, and extensive jejunal disease.</p><p/><p>Steatorrhea can lead to severe malnutrition, clotting abnormalities, osteomalacia, and hypocalcemia, which may cause tetany.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12689085\"><span class=\"h2\">Other gastrointestinal involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical manifestations of other sites of gastrointestinal involvement in CD are variable and infrequent. Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe oral involvement may present with aphthous ulcers or pain in the mouth and gums.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Esophageal involvement may present with odynophagia and dysphagia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gallstones may form since the reduction in the bile acid to cholesterol ratio makes bile more lithogenic and abnormalities in bilirubin metabolism predispose to pigment stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p>Gastroduodenal CD, seen in up to 15 percent of patients, may present with upper abdominal pain, nausea, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> postprandial vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The clinical features of gastroduodenal CD may be similar to those of peptic ulcer disease or gastric outlet obstruction. </p><p>The distal antrum of the stomach and duodenum are the most commonly affected upper gastrointestinal sites in patients with CD. There are patients with very mild and limited upper gastrointestinal involvement, with or without symptoms, while others with significant symptoms have severe disease characterized by deep ulcers and longer segments of intestinal involvement. Patients with extensive upper gastrointestinal tract involvement tend to have a more aggressive disease course compared to patients without gastroduodenal involvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12689092\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatigue is a common feature of CD. Weight loss is often related to decreased oral intake since patients with obstructing segments of bowel feel better when they do not eat. Weight loss may also be related to malabsorption.</p><p>Fever occurs less frequently and may be due to the inflammatory process itself or may be the result of a perforation with a complicating peribowel infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12689099\"><span class=\"h2\">Extraintestinal manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CD and ulcerative colitis share a number of extraintestinal manifestations generally related to inflammatory disease activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81867\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81867 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-crohn-disease-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>These manifestations, which tend to be more frequent with colonic involvement, include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Arthritis or arthropathy</strong> &ndash; Primarily involving large joints in approximately 20 percent of patients without synovial destruction, arthritis is the most common extraintestinal manifestation. Central or axial arthritis, such as sacroiliitis, or ankylosing spondylitis, may also occur.

CD may involve the entire gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the perianal area. (See <a href=\"#H12689022\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of CD are variable, and patients can have symptoms for many years prior to diagnosis. Prolonged diarrhea with abdominal pain, with or without gross bleeding, fatigue, and weight loss are the hallmarks of CD. (See <a href=\"#H12689029\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients can present with symptoms secondary to the transmural involvement of the bowel, including fistulas, phlegmon, abscess, perianal disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> malabsorption. Extraintestinal manifestations, such as arthritis or arthropathy, eye and skin disorders, biliary tract involvement, and kidney stones, may occur and tend to be more frequent with colonic involvement. (See <a href=\"#H12689029\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The extensive differential diagnosis associated with CD varies with the site of involvement and the chronicity of the clinical presentation. (See <a href=\"#H12689106\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of CD is established with endoscopic and imaging studies of the bowel in a patient with a compatible clinical history. Colonoscopy with intubation of the terminal ileum is used to establish the diagnosis of ileocolonic CD. We perform a magnetic resonance enterography as the initial test to evaluate the small intestine. Wireless capsule endoscopy may also be useful for detecting small bowel involvement. (See <a href=\"#H12689148\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although several serologic markers for CD are commercially available, the accuracy and predictive value of these markers for the diagnosis of CD remain to be elucidated. (See <a href=\"#H12689190\" class=\"local\">'Serologic markers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The typical course in patients with CD involving the small <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> large intestine is one of intermittent exacerbations of symptoms followed by periods of remission.
