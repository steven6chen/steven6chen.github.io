These conditions, which range in severity, are due to abnormalities of the developing brain resulting from a variety of causes. Although the disorder itself is not progressive, the appearance of neuropathologic lesions and their clinical expression may change over time as the brain matures.</p><p>The management and prognosis of CP are reviewed here. The epidemiology, etiology, prevention, classification, clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of CP are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-etiology-and-prevention-of-cerebral-palsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, etiology, and prevention of cerebral palsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-classification-of-cerebral-palsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and classification of cerebral palsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-cerebral-palsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of cerebral palsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT GOALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychological development, communication, and education are priorities in the management of CP. Management should be directed at promoting the child's:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social and emotional development</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Communication</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Education</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutrition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mobility</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maximal independence in activities of daily living</p><p/><p>Longitudinal assessment of social, language, and cognitive skills allows for individualized training in communication and activities of daily living, and allows the child to derive the maximum benefit from school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Interventions for CP should be directed at maximizing the quality of life by improvement in daily function and reducing the extent of disability. Initially, the parents and other caregivers should learn how to seat, dress, feed, communicate with, transfer, transport, and toilet the child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. With growth and development, the goals are to help the child achieve maximal independence in these activities. As the child becomes older, assessment and training for a potential occupation may become important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Management of the child with CP requires a multidisciplinary team to address the multiple medical, social, psychological, educational, and therapeutic needs. Team members should have a goal-oriented approach that is based upon an understanding and appreciation of contributions from all the disciplines. The team should set functional goals for the child that are realistic, and these goals should be periodically reevaluated. Participation of the principal caregivers and teachers in treatment sessions is essential. It should be recognized that different areas of development are interdependent. It is important to address the emotional and recreational needs of the child and parents, as well as treating physical aspects of the disability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107637599\"><span class=\"h1\">FUNCTIONAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for CP is based upon patient's limitations in body structure and function.

It is useful for assessment of specific muscle groups before and after an intervention, such as botulinum toxin (BTX) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">baclofen</a>, although the reliability characteristics of the test are not ideal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Other widely used tools for evaluating function include the <a href=\"http://www.macs.nu/&amp;token=EcBV29j6Wf11fYv7p1I3bwLE+9hVc+y6Jq+4TxJvlGA=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6176\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Manual Ability Classification System</a> (MACS) and the <a href=\"http://cfcs.us/&amp;token=j9UWcFlTVb5IfQxyO4+M14vR8ciQfk800A463Fedms0=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6176\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Communication Function Classification System</a> (CFCS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SPASTICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgery may help to reduce spasticity, hyperreflexia, and clonus, although they do not improve weakness and incoordination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Furthermore, whether these interventions improve functional outcomes is uncertain.</p><p>For medical therapy of spasticity, there is stronger evidence supporting botulinum toxin (BTX) than there is for oral antispastic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The evidence and clinical use of each approach is discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Botulinum toxin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injection of botulinum toxin type A (BTX A) into affected muscles blocks the presynaptic release of acetylcholine from motor endplates of the lower motor neuron at the myoneural junction and decreases tone by limiting muscle contraction. BTX A is used primarily in calf muscles to treat dynamic equinus of the ankle in patients with diplegia or hemiplegia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. It is injected into several areas of the muscle. Injections must be repeated every three to eight months to maintain the effect. Most reports suggest that the drug is generally safe, but there have been case reports of life-threatening systemic toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BTX A temporarily reduces spasticity and either lengthens or delays the shortening of affected muscles, as shown by case series, open label studies, and clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/11,13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13-18</a>]. Clinical trial evidence also suggests that BTX A in combination with physical and occupational therapy improves some functional outcomes, although it may not improve gait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/11,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,19-21</a>].</p><p>In a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 235 children (mean age 5.9 years) with spastic CP with dynamic equinus foot deformity, BTX A treatment improved muscle tone as assessed by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93413\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93413 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. At four weeks following injection, the mean MAS score improved from 3.1 to 2.2 among patients treated with a BTX A dose of 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg/leg</span> (mean difference -0.97 [95% CI -1.18 to -0.76]); from 3.1 to 2.3 in patients treated with a dose of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg/leg</span> (mean difference -0.86 [95% CI -1.07 to -0.65]); and from 3.2 to 2.6 in patients who received placebo (mean difference -0.48 [95% CI -0.69 to -0.27]). Global clinical status was assessed using a 9-point scale from -4 (markedly worse) to +4 (markedly improved). Mean global assessment scores at week four were 1.54 (95% CI 1.28-1.81), 1.50 (95% CI 1.23-1.77), and 0.73 (95% CI 0.46-0.99) for the BTX A 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg/leg,</span> BTX A 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg/leg,</span> and placebo groups, respectively.</p><p>The effect of BTX A treatment on bone and soft tissue are not clear. Investigators have hypothesized that, in addition to reducing tone, early treatment may modify the effect of spasticity on bone and soft tissue and reduce the extent of later surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. However, one long-term study (median length of treatment 18 months) showed gradual deterioration in range of motion, despite beneficial effects on muscle tone after each injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The study did not include a control group, so it is unclear whether the range of motion deteriorated faster or slower than patients who were not treated with BTX A. These observations suggest that long-term treatment with BTX A is not necessarily effective in preventing contractures and raises the possibility that it could even contribute to contracture formation.</p><p>Treatment benefits may be subtle and may not be obvious to the patient or family. A randomized placebo-controlled trial showed no difference in the family's satisfaction with the child's function, despite documentation of improvement in spasticity and function in the botulinum-treated group, using a variety of objective measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. These observations underscore that providers should communicate realistic expectations to the family prior to embarking on treatment.</p><p>Three to 10 percent of adults develop neutralizing antibodies to the toxin after repeated injections and no longer benefit from treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. A two-year trial in children did not detect a cumulative or persisting effect with serial BTX A injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This study also did not detect a waning effect of serial treatment, but neutralizing antibodies were not measured.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BTX A is indicated in patients who have increased muscle tone that interferes with function or is likely to lead to joint contracture with growth. The best evidence is for equinus varus (treated by injections into the gastrocnemius-soleus muscles), but BTX A is now used for a variety of focal indications including knee and hip flexion spasticity and spasticity of the upper extremity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/11,30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,30-34</a>]. The treatment can be valuable for patients with a wide range of severity (<a href=\"https://www.ccshrif.org/download/Resource+Corner+and+Tools/GMFCS-ER.pdf&amp;token=R4Uiw8/bmPVaqNHRDqpXLGqcvQqd+y4eBSMI7wINB/P/AroVAGRo+afAGypGbCMLcIUN5UiS2F1mROjHuycalK2SIjzYFvLgd11Rrxr+6l4=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6176\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Gross Motor Function Classification System</a> [GMFCS] I to V) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Patients younger than four years old and without fixed contractures are expected to have the most favorable response because the musculoskeletal and nervous system is most plastic in growing children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Nonetheless, BTX A also may be useful to treat focal issues in older children and adults. Some patients become less responsive to BTX A over time (secondary non-response) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>]. In some cases this is associated with the development of neutralizing antibodies, but neutralizing antibodies do not always cause treatment non-response. The relative immunogenicity of different BTX preparations has not been fully established.</p><p>For patients with diffuse hypertonia, BTX A can be injected into multiple muscles to treat the main foci of the generalized spasticity. Ideally, only two or three muscles will require treatment at one time. Fixed contractures are not amenable to BTX therapy, although BTX A injections may facilitate serial casting. (See <a href=\"#H107635552\" class=\"local\">'Casting'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to therapy, a complete baseline assessment should be performed by a multidisciplinary team [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The evaluation should include range of motion, strength, and assessment of selective motor control, muscle tone, and function. Treatment goals should be specified and the patient should be reevaluated about six to eight weeks after the injection to assess whether these goals have been met, as this is the peak of response to BTX A.</p><p>Dosing of BTX A depends on the muscles injected, body weight, muscle bulk, the number of muscles being injected simultaneously, and the patient's response to previous therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/38,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,44</a>]. No reliable potency standard has been established for BTX A, and the biological effects vary greatly among preparations from different manufacturers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. As a result, the different BTX A preparations (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=abobotulinumtoxina-dysport-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">abobotulinumtoxinA</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incobotulinumtoxina-xeomin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">incobotulinumtoxinA</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onabotulinumtoxina-botox-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">onabotulinumtoxinA</a>) should not be used interchangeably, and separate dosing schemes must be established for each. The patient should be reevaluated six to eight weeks after treatment. The effect typically lasts three to eight months, after which treatment can be repeated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of complications after BTX A injection are transient, mild, and self-limiting. These include fever, which may last for one to three days, and transient pain, local irritation, and bruising [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. A few patients experience temporary weakness and loss of function in the injected area, including urinary or fecal incontinence due to sphincter dysfunction for lower extremity injections. These symptoms usually last less than two weeks and may be related to a dose that is too high or previously undiagnosed muscle weakness.</p><p>There is a small possibility of life-threatening systemic adverse effects from local BTX injections. Because of reports of severe difficulty swallowing or breathing in several children with CP receiving local injections for limb spasticity, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning about the use of BTX A in 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Some of these complications appear to be caused by inadvertent overdosing because potency determinations expressed in &quot;units&quot; varied among BTX products. In response, the FDA mandated changes in drug names, designed to emphasize these differences in drug potency and prevent medication errors, and updated the <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/DrugSafetyInformationforHeathcareProfessionals/ucm174949.htm&amp;token=9wh02IQU1IMBRfVPx4plM/1kKn75qqNApAGmFxQl4bVj5acDgMmAJ8eP08Wfthem/RcXJNKuZjnjzuNdwTOJk4cUilt5jG0Wz15COBzymIkpwHJX6MPqmV2YYIY7PPfu/ESj1guH2dUYbYnyxgUwnaRd4xMCQJfypD/LtsVmdwI=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6176\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Drug Safety Information</a> for healthcare professionals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Providers should be alert for the potential of systemic effects, including dysphagia, dysphonia, weakness, or dyspnea, which may occur up to several weeks after treatment.</p><p>The types and frequency of BTX A complications were illustrated by a series of 334 children with CP undergoing 596 injections at a single center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Procedural events (pain or bruising at injection site, vomiting or nausea due to sedatives) occurred in 5 percent, localized weakness or sphincter problems in 6 percent, and a flu-like illness in 1.5 percent. Sentinel events, consisting of generalized weakness, worsening dysphagia, or lower respiratory tract infections, occurred in 2.4 percent.</p><p>In a small randomized controlled trial, the rate of moderate or severe adverse events was similar among children who received BTX A injections (n = 23) compared with children who received sham injections (n = 18) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral antispastic drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benzodiazepines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dantrolene-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dantrolene</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">baclofen</a> have been used by some clinicians to treat spasticity in CP but are generally less useful than BTX. This view is supported by findings of a systematic review published in 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The review concluded that evidence regarding effectiveness of these drugs is scarce and weak. Only 12 double-blind trials with a total of 469 patients met criteria for inclusion. The general methodological quality of these studies was poor. In addition, most studies were of small size and short treatment duration; the magnitude of the therapeutic effect was described in only four studies and it was small. Only three of the included trials tested antispastic drugs in patients with CP, one with baclofen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>] and two with dantrolene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Benzodiazepines</strong> &ndash; Benzodiazepines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazepam</a>, reduce spasticity through presynaptic inhibition. These drugs act on benzodiazepine receptors that are linked to receptors for the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) located on the terminals of primary afferent fibers, causing increased affinity for GABA at the receptor site. Studies of moderate quality suggest that diazepam is probably effective for the short-term treatment of spasticity in children with CP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/11,21,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21,53</a>]. The tranquilizer effect makes benzodiazepines useful in dyskinetic CP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

Side effects, which are common, include weakness, drowsiness, lethargy, paresthesias, nausea, and diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The use of this drug may be limited by hepatic toxicity, which occurred in 1.8 percent of 1044 patients treated for at least 60 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. When additional cases of dantrolene-associated hepatic disease reported after marketing of the drug were included in the analysis, the case fatality rate of 50 cases was 28 percent.

Activation of these receptors inhibits the influx of calcium ions into presynaptic terminals and suppresses release of excitatory neurotransmitters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. This inhibits monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes and reduces gamma efferent activity. Limited evidence from two small randomized trials in children with CP suggested that oral baclofen results in modest improvement of spasticity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/50,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,57</a>]. Side effects are common and include confusion, sedation, hypotonia, ataxia, paresthesias, and nausea. Seizures and hallucination may occur if the drug is discontinued abruptly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrathecal baclofen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrathecal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">baclofen</a> (administered via a pump) achieves higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drug levels as compared with oral administration, which results in low CSF drug levels because of poor lipid solubility. Intrathecal baclofen may be effective in reducing spasticity in severely affected patients, but its use is also associated with substantial complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/11,59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,59-61</a>]. Therefore, this treatment is generally restricted to patients with severe spasticity that is not responsive to other measures.

Evidence for the advantages or otherwise of intrathecal baclofen over selective dorsal rhizotomy is lacking. Both procedures carry significantly more risk than less invasive interventions.</p><p>A case series described successful treatment of 35 children with severe CP, treated with a continuous infusion of intrathecal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">baclofen</a> for 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The patients experienced early improvement in pain and sleep, and later improvement in social function and mobility.

This interrupts the afferent limb of the reflex arc on the sensory side, thus reducing spasticity without causing paralysis. This technique may provide a small gain in function.</p><p>A meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>] evaluated outcomes of three randomized controlled trials of SDR plus physiotherapy (PT) compared with PT alone in a total of 90 children (82 younger than eight years of age) with spastic diplegia who were primarily ambulatory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-73</a>]. Spasticity at 9 to 12 months (assessed by the Ashworth scale) was significantly less with SDR plus PT compared with PT alone. The SDR group had a modest, but significant, improvement in function (assessed by the Gross Motor Function Measure [GMFM]) and this correlated with the proportion of dorsal root tissue that was transected. No serious adverse events were reported. Most of the evidence regarding outcomes is in children between four and ten years of age.</p><p>Long-term outcomes of SDR are described in several observational case series, which included ambulatory and nonambulatory patients (GMFCS levels I through III) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/74-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-78</a>]. In the largest of these series, statistically significant durable improvements in lower-limb muscle tone, gross motor function, and performance of activities of daily living were found in each GFMCS group, although individual results varied and nearly 40 percent needed additional treatment with BTX injection or lower extremity orthopedic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Which children are most likely to benefit from SDR is uncertain. The available evidence to guide treatment is limited and practice varies. Some clinicians have applied this technique to children with relatively high levels of physical function (eg, ambulatory children), and report long-term benefits on gait abnormalities, as measured by instrumented gait analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Other clinicians reserve the procedure for severely affected nonambulatory patients with contractures. In these children, SDR aids in cleanliness and dressing.

Children with severe CP often have reduced energy needs because of inactivity, but sometimes have increased energy needs because of spasticity (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of enteral nutrition in infants and children&quot;</a>).</p><p>Aspiration and swallowing dysfunction in children is discussed in detail separately.

In one study, the mechanisms of drooling were evaluated in children with CP by measuring intraoral pressure during the suction and propulsion stages of swallowing small amounts of liquid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>]. Drooling was associated with abnormal suction of liquid onto the tongue caused by incomplete lip closure during swallowing, low suction pressure, and prolonged delay between suction and propelling stages.</p><p>Approaches to improve drooling include medication, behavior therapy, and surgery. Drooling improves with age in some patients. Thus, we attempt behavioral and pharmacologic management (usually with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glycopyrrolate</a>) before considering surgery.</p><p>A trial of behavioral therapy is appropriate for children who are able to understand commands and cooperate with training. This consists of oral awareness and oral motor skills training, designed to improve lip and jaw closure and tongue movements with positive reinforcement for swallowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/153,154\" class=\"abstract_t\">153,154</a>]. The oral motor skills program is often initially taught by a specialist in speech and language pathology and implemented at home by the child's caretakers. Measures to improve the child's posture also may reduce drooling.</p><p>Medications for drooling include anticholinergic agents and botulinum toxin type A (BTX A) injection into the salivary glands:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticholinergic agents, such as benzhexol hydrochloride (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=trihexyphenidyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">trihexyphenidyl</a> hydrochloride), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">scopolamine</a> (also known as hyoscine), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glycopyrrolate</a>, act by decreasing the flow of saliva [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/155,156\" class=\"abstract_t\">155,156</a>]. A flavored liquid formulation of glycopyrrolate (Cuvposa) has been developed. Scopolamine may be administered via transdermal patches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/157\" class=\"abstract_t\">157</a>]. Potential side effects of these anticholinergic agents include swallowing difficulties due to sticky secretions, hyperactivity, blurred vision, and urinary retention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BTX A injection into the salivary glands also decreases saliva flow. In an open-label clinical trial, drooling severity was measured in 45 children with CP at baseline, after treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scopolamine-hyoscine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">scopolamine</a>, and after submandibular injection with BTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>]. Drooling was reduced in approximately one-half of patients after both scopolamine and BTX; however, fewer and less severe adverse effects were noted with BTX. In another report from the same group, the mean reduction in submandibular flow was significantly greater with BTX injections than with scopolamine therapy (42 and 25 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>]. Among responders, the effect of BTX waned over time, lasting a median of 22 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/160\" class=\"abstract_t\">160</a>]. About 25 percent of initial responders still had a clinically significant response at 33 weeks after BTX injection.</p><p/><p>Surgical treatment of drooling is directed at reducing salivary production. Techniques include repositioning of the submandibular ducts and unilateral ligation of a parotid duct, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excision of the sublingual gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/161-164\" class=\"abstract_t\">161-164</a>]. Although surgery reduces drooling frequency and severity in 75 to 90 percent of patients, complications such as ranula formation, dry mouth, difficulty with swallowing, and changes in the consistency of oral secretions are common, limiting the acceptance of this intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/161,163,165\" class=\"abstract_t\">161,163,165</a>]. Repositioning the salivary glands may increase the aspiration among patients with a high-risk aspiration. A case series of patients who were treated with BTX and then surgery suggests that surgery is more consistently and satisfactorily effective in reducing drooling frequency at 8- and 32-week timepoints as compared with BTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/165\" class=\"abstract_t\">165</a>]. This study is limited by a risk for selection bias because it described only patients who elected to have surgery after undergoing BTX treatment. However, the authors state that the primary motivation for surgery was a desire for a more permanent solution to drooling rather than primary failure of BTX.</p><p>The combination of biofeedback techniques and behavior modification has been used to reduce drooling by making swallowing a conscious action. In a study of 12 children with CP, biofeedback training and the use of an auditory signal to cue swallowing increased the rate of swallowing and made swallowing more effective, resulting in significantly decreased drooling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/166\" class=\"abstract_t\">166</a>]. A systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence to determine if this type of intervention is effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/167\" class=\"abstract_t\">167</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H338446836\"><span class=\"h1\">OSTEOPENIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment with bisphosphonates is generally reserved for pediatric patients with severe reductions in bone mineral density and pathological extremity fractures or vertebral compression. In a small randomized trial, treatment with high doses of intravenous (IV) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">pamidronate</a> for 12 months increased bone mineral density in children with quadriplegic CP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/168\" class=\"abstract_t\">168</a>]. Lower doses also appeared to be effective in an open-label trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/169\" class=\"abstract_t\">169</a>]. Systematic reviews concluded that there is weak evidence that bisphosphonates reduce fracture rates; however, there are some concerns that pamidronate and other bisphosphonates may make bones more brittle, and information about long-term risks of these drugs is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/170,171\" class=\"abstract_t\">170,171</a>]. Weight-bearing regimens and supplementation of calcium and vitamin D have shown some merit, but the evidence is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/170-176\" class=\"abstract_t\">170-176</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H338447669\"><span class=\"h1\">URINARY INCONTINENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to CP patients with urinary incontinence is similar to that of patients without CP. The treatment of choice for detrusor overactivity is anticholinergic medication. However, this must be done judiciously, with careful monitoring of residual urine to prevent the development of retention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-bladder-dysfunction-in-children#H13887223\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of bladder dysfunction in children&quot;, section on 'Anticholinergic agents'</a>.)</p><p>For children with CP who have features of a neurogenic bladder, management depends on whether the bladder is underactive or overactive, and may include anticholinergic medication, alterations of the toileting schedule or environment, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clean intermittent catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/177\" class=\"abstract_t\">177</a>]. The management of these patients is similar to that in patients with myelomeningocele. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract complications of myelomeningocele (spina bifida)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Social and psychological support is essential, as it is for any family with a child with a chronic medical condition. Parents of a child with CP may experience chronic grief, as well as guilt, frustration, denial, anger, resentment, and embarrassment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/178\" class=\"abstract_t\">178</a>]. They may limit themselves socially and strain relationships with their spouse and other children. Some express dissatisfaction with health care professionals.</p><p>Information about their child's condition should be provided to parents with honesty and sensitivity, beginning with the first encounter. The process of evaluation and management should be described, with the understanding that repetition may be necessary because the parents may not assimilate all the information during the first visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/179,180\" class=\"abstract_t\">179,180</a>]. A second opinion should be offered if appropriate.</p><p>Clinicians should avoid being dogmatic or providing uncertain long-term prognoses. Parents should be given the opportunity to ask questions and express their feelings. They may feel a need to attribute CP to a specific cause, however inappropriate, because the feeling of being victimized by fate is too distressing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/181\" class=\"abstract_t\">181</a>]. It is important to attempt to relieve guilt that may result from fantasies of causation. Counseling should be an ongoing process. Parents should be aware that counseling services are always available.</p><p>Other resources for children with CP and other disabilities are available in many communities, including support groups for families and siblings. In addition, specialized recreational programs may be available to permit participation in sports or other activities. For children with mild or moderate CP, some form of sports participation is often feasible and has important benefits including minimizing the deconditioning that can be caused by impaired mobility, optimizing physical functioning, promoting socialization, and improving self-esteem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/182,183\" class=\"abstract_t\">182,183</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Technological support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Technological aids provide important support for patients with CP, especially those with severe motor impairment. Equipment such as motorized wheelchairs, switching devices used to activate communication systems, voice-activated computers, and other environmental control systems can improve quality of life by enhancing functional abilities and social interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>].</p><p>The use of augmentative communication strategies for individuals who are nonverbal, or have diminished language skills, can be helpful in promoting communication and decreasing frustration related to communication deficits. There is good evidence that the use of such technologies does not interfere with the development of language skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/184\" class=\"abstract_t\">184</a>]. A range of strategies with varying technical complexity, including picture symbols and voice output devices, can be used in children with CP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/185\" class=\"abstract_t\">185</a>]. Strategies must be individualized and appropriate for the individual's cognitive and motor capacities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Survival</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of children with CP survive to adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/186-189\" class=\"abstract_t\">186-189</a>]. In a regional analysis of children with CP who were born in various regions of the United Kingdom between 1980 and 1996, 20-year survival ranged from 87 to 94 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/188\" class=\"abstract_t\">188</a>]. In multivariate analysis, survival was related to severity of impairment, birth weight (BW), and socioeconomic status, with the number of severe impairments having the greatest effect.</p><p>Survival of adults with CP also depends upon the degree of disability. In one report, life expectancies and predictors of mortality were evaluated in affected patients &ge;4 years old who received services in California from 1983 to 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/190\" class=\"abstract_t\">190</a>]. Survival in high-functioning adults was similar to the general population. However, life expectancy was substantially reduced in the most severely affected children. Among children who do not lift their heads when lying in the prone position, the median age at death was 10.9 years in the 1983, and improved to 17.1 years in 2010. Similar results were shown in a population study from Sweden, in which 60 percent survived to age 19 among children with severe CP (level V of the <a href=\"https://www.ccshrif.org/download/Resource+Corner+and+Tools/GMFCS-ER.pdf&amp;token=R4Uiw8/bmPVaqNHRDqpXLGqcvQqd+y4eBSMI7wINB/P/AroVAGRo+afAGypGbCMLcIUN5UiS2F1mROjHuycalK2SIjzYFvLgd11Rrxr+6l4=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6176\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Gross Motor Function Classification System</a> [GMFCS]), as compared with 100 percent survival among those with mild gross motor deficits (GMFCS levels I and II) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/189\" class=\"abstract_t\">189</a>].</p><p>In patients with severe multiple handicaps, the mortality rate is partly affected by the aggressiveness and quality of care. In one study from 1993, children with CP who were immobile, had no toilet skills, and required tube feedings typically died by five years of age, and only 20 percent survived to 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/191\" class=\"abstract_t\">191</a>]. Respiratory disease, often aspiration pneumonia, is the most common cause of death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Motor impairment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extent of motor impairment is difficult to predict in young children, except at the extremes of mild or severe involvement. In general, prognosis for motor function depends upon the type of CP, rate of motor development, presence of developmental reflexes, intellectual ability, sensory impairment, and emotional-social adjustment. Severe motor deficits are often, but not always, accompanied by significant intellectual impairment. Patients with CP who walk before age two years typically have normal or borderline normal IQs.</p><p>Nearly all children with hemiplegic CP will walk, as will many with athetosis or ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/192-196\" class=\"abstract_t\">192-196</a>]. The prognosis for walking is poor in children who do not achieve head balance by 20 months, retain primitive reflexes, or have no postural reactions by 24 months, or do not crawl by approximately five years of age. The prognosis for walking is good in children who sit by two years and crawl before 30 months of age. Some children who sit between three and four years of age eventually walk, but most require aids or braces or have restricted functional ambulation. In general, children who walk independently do so by approximately three years of age; those who walk only with support may take up to nine years. A child who does not walk by nine years of age is unlikely to ever walk, even with support.</p><p>Early predictors of walking were illustrated in a prospective longitudinal study in which 233 children with CP were followed from 12 months to 3 to 11 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/193\" class=\"abstract_t\">193</a>]. Some degree of functional walking was attained by 78.7 percent. The probability of walking was favorable in congenital hemiplegic and ataxic CP and poor in hypotonic CP. However, outcome was quite variable in spastic diplegic, quadriparetic, spastic-athetoid, and athetoid CP. The ability to sit by age two years was a highly reliable predictor of walking. However, more than one-half of those who eventually walked did not sit by two years. Among the latter, suppression of primitive reflex activity between 18 and 24 months predicted eventual walking.</p><p>Curves have been developed for predicting the rate and extent of motor development based on the child's age and current level of function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/197\" class=\"abstract_t\">197</a>]. These are based on a longitudinal study in which 657 children with CP, aged 1 to 13 years, were followed serially for four years using the Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66), a validated measure of motor function. These curves can be used to guide interventions and monitor progress over time.</p><p>Although predictions of motor development provide important prognostic information, parents should understand that considerable variability occurs within each severity group. In addition, functional outcome in CP depends on multiple factors besides motor function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/198\" class=\"abstract_t\">198</a>]. These include intelligence, physical function, ability to communicate, and personality attributes. Social (eg, family support) and environmental factors and the availability of specialist medical care play an important role. Adjustment is facilitated by the availability of training, independent or sheltered employment, and counseling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H388091\"><span class=\"h2\">Quality of life</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quality of life is subjective and difficult to measure in children who aren't able to communicate. Parent-reported child quality of life is lower in children with low motor function, low IQ level, pain, and high parental stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/199\" class=\"abstract_t\">199</a>]. Among 8 to 12-year-old children who can self-report, quality of life is similar to that of children in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy/abstract/200\" class=\"abstract_t\">200</a>].

For medical therapy of spasticity, there is stronger evidence to support the use of botulinum toxin (BTX) than there is for oral antispastic drugs. Selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) is a surgical approach that may be helpful in some patients, however, the data to guide patient selection are limited.
