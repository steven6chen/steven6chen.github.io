It is a movement disorder characterized by chorea (involuntary brief, random and irregular movements of the limbs and face), emotional lability, and hypotonia.</p><p>This topic reviews the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of SC. Other clinical manifestations of ARF and the approach to diagnosis and treatment of rheumatic fever are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Treatment and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although SC is clearly related to group A streptococcal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], its pathogenesis is not completely understood. Molecular mimicry, in which antibodies directed against part of the group A streptococcus bacterium crossreact with host antigens in susceptible subjects, is thought to play an important role.</p><p>In acute rheumatic fever (ARF), antibodies are mounted against N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine (NABG or GlcNAc), the immunodominant carbohydrate antigen of group A streptococci. These antibodies likely play a role in valvular injury in rheumatic carditis, and in other manifestations of ARF (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Molecular mimicry'</a>).</p><p>Different subsets of NABG antibodies appear to correlate with distinct clinical manifestations of ARF. In SC, the antibodies bind to lysoganglioside on the neuronal cell surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], where they are capable of triggering a signaling cascade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These antibodies also recognize the intracellular protein tubulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Tubulin-specific antibodies are not found in patients with ARF without SC, or in patients who have recovered from SC. The genes encoding these antibodies are similar to the genes encoding antibodies implicated in the pathogenesis of motor neuropathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thus, tubulin appears to be an important neuronal target in the pathogenesis of SC.</p><p>From a pathophysiologic viewpoint, the available data suggest involvement of the basal ganglia and cortical structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In individual case reports, magnetic resonance imaging studies performed during and after an acute episode of SC demonstrated reversible abnormalities of the striatum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging showed striatal hypermetabolism and hyperperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H458230982\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and SC has declined dramatically in resource-rich settings since the early twentieth century due to improvements in living conditions and routine use of antibiotics for group A streptococcal infections; however, ARF remains an important public health concern in resource-limited settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Chorea is a common manifestation of rheumatic fever, particularly in developing countries. In the United States, chorea was reported in 18 to 36 percent of cases of rheumatic fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>].</p><p>SC occurs most commonly in patients between 5 and 13 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Females are affected more frequently than males by a ratio of 2:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Chorea appears to be less common in adults, particularly men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p>SC appears to have a familial predisposition: a family history of rheumatic fever occurs in up to 30 percent of families with a history of chorea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology of ARF is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SC is a movement disorder characterized by chorea (involuntary brief, random and irregular movements of the limbs and face), emotional lability, and hypotonia. In contrast to carditis and arthritis, which typically present within 21 days, the onset of chorea usually occurs one to eight months after the inciting infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>).</p><p>The onset of SC is typically insidious but may be abrupt. Emotional changes, such as easy crying or inappropriate laughing, may precede, be concurrent with, or follow the development of chorea. Mild cases of SC without other manifestations of rheumatic fever may be mistakenly ascribed to behavioral or emotional disorders, Tourette syndrome, or clumsiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The chorea typically worsens over hours to days. It is characterized by rapid, irregular, and nonstereotypic jerking movements of the limbs and restlessness of the trunk. Symptoms are typically continuous while awake, worsen with attempted action, and improve with sleep. The chorea usually is generalized but may be more prominent on one side; 20 to 30 percent have hemichorea (ie, unilateral chorea) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/11,17,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17,19-21</a>]. Patients experience these movements as involuntary, not compulsive or urge-driven.</p><p>Motor symptoms, including ballismus, facial grimacing, and restless movements of the tongue, are often observed. These symptoms are associated with motor impersistence (characterized by &quot;milkmaid's grip&quot;), interference with gross and fine motor control, muscle weakness, and hypotonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>On neurological examination, mental status is typically normal. A confusional state suggests an alternative diagnosis (eg, encephalitis). (See <a href=\"#H956339\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p>The child may be reluctant to speak, and usually appears restless or fidgety while sitting unsupported on the examination table. Speech may be dysarthric. Reduced verbal fluency is common and may correlate with severity of motor signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Cranial nerve function is not affected. Motor examination should include the four maneuvers described below, with the child attempting to sit up straight unsupported on the examination table. Each of these findings tends to become more pronounced if the examiner concurrently gives the child a separate motor task (eg, asking the child to speak during the first three maneuvers):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spooning &ndash; The child is seated with arms extended fully forward from the shoulders, hands pronated, fingers spread wide. The typical finding suggestive of SC is symmetric hyperextension at the metacarpophalangeal joint (so arm and hand look like a spoon). This finding is most often symmetric, but may be seen more prominently on one side. Both proximal and distal limb chorea may also be noted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Touchdown &ndash; The child is seated with arms and hands fully extended up and palms facing one another (as if making a &quot;touchdown&quot; sign). The typical finding is pronation of one or both hands and flexion of the elbows.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Milkmaid's grip &ndash; The child is asked to use both hands to grip both of the examiner's index and middle fingers. Choreic and hypotonic &quot;intrusions&quot; occur, causing the child to partly release his or her grip, only to re-grip again, repeatedly, giving a &quot;milking the cow&quot; type feeling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Darting tongue &ndash; The child is asked to stick his or her tongue out with mouth open. Similar to the grip, the motor command cannot be consistently maintained. The tongue withdraws repeatedly, resulting in a darting, snake-like appearance. Children may spontaneously use their teeth to grab the tongue, to try to keep the tongue protruded. </p><p/><p>No sensory loss occurs. The Patellar reflexes are unaffected or may be &quot;hung up&quot; due to a combination of hypotonia and sustained <span class=\"nowrap\">contraction/delayed</span> relaxation after eliciting the patellar reflex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Gait may be lurching or unsteady due to choreic intrusions into locomotion. This is distinct from gait ataxia but may be confusing, as in both cases gait may appear broad based.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychiatric symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SC is not typically associated with delirium; however, it is often associated with a variety of psychiatric symptoms, including irritability, outbursts of inappropriate behavior, and distractibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. SC also has a frequent association with obsessive-compulsive symptomatology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/24,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27-29</a>]. As an example, one report prospectively evaluated 50 children with rheumatic fever, 30 with and 20 without chorea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms occurred in 70 percent of the patients with chorea, but in none of those without chorea. Obsessive-compulsive disorder was diagnosed in 17 percent of the patients with chorea in this series and in 4 of 11 (35 percent) in another report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The psychiatric symptoms typically occur during the first two months of rheumatic fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms can precede, occur concomitant with, or occur after the onset of chorea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The psychiatric symptoms tend to wax and wane with the motor symptoms. In rare cases, they are severe and can result in transient psychosis or delirium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Association with other manifestations of rheumatic fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SC often is seen without arthritis or carditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19</a>]. In one series of 158 episodes of SC in 108 people in northern Australia, carditis was present in 28 percent and arthritis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arthralgia in 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Different results were noted in an outbreak of rheumatic fever in Utah between 1985 and 1986, in which chorea occurred in 28 percent of cases but was an isolated finding in only 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>Echocardiographic studies have confirmed that subclinical carditis is common in patients with SC. In one series of 22 patients, the overall incidence of valvular involvement was 63 percent; carditis was detected clinically in five patients and Doppler echocardiography detected silent mitral regurgitation in an additional nine cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected SC should be directed toward diagnosing acute rheumatic fever (ARF) according to published guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This includes testing for group A streptococcal (GAS) infection and a cardiac evaluation. In addition, inflammatory markers (ie, C-reactive protein [CRP] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) should be measured at the time of initial presentation, though these tests are typically normal. In children with atypical features (eg, fever or delirium), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, neuroimaging, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> additional testing may help exclude other causes of chorea. Referral to a child neurologist or movement disorder specialist can help guide the diagnostic evaluation, particularly in atypical cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2424373923\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing for GAS infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing for active or recent group A streptococcal (GAS) infection should be performed in all patients with suspected SC; however, evidence of current or prior GAS infection is not always present. Throat cultures are often negative by the time chorea appears; however, they should be routinely obtained because it is important to identify recurrent GAS infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H100643063\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Evidence of preceding GAS infection'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the throat culture, blood tests for both streptococcal antibodies antistreptolysin O (ASO) and antideoxyribonuclease (anti-DNAse) B should be obtained to assess for preceding streptococcal infection. Either or both antibodies may remain elevated for months after a GAS infection, and a rising titer on serial tests more accurately defines a recent acute infection than does a single elevated titer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The false-positive rate is high, given the high prevalence of GAS infections and long duration of antibody elevation. Thus, the diagnostic value of antibody testing is greatest when the history, and examination support a diagnosis of ARF with chorea. In this case, a single blood test is adequate when positive to confirm the most likely diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1405884120\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with suspected SC should have a detailed cardiac evaluation to assess for carditis. We obtain an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The presence of carditis in a patient with new onset chorea confirms the diagnosis of SC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H100643069\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Cardiac evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1427073125\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammatory markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammatory markers (eg, CRP, ESR) are included in the diagnostic criteria for ARF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F105134\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105134 \">table 1</a>) and should be obtained in all patients; however, most patients show little evidence of acute inflammation at the time of presentation with SC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H100642919\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>.)</p><p>Elevated CRP <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ESR may be seen in patients with recurrent chorea due to recurrent GAS infection. Alternatively, elevated inflammatory markers may be an indication of another diagnosis as the underlying cause of the chorea (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, encephalitis). (See <a href=\"#H956339\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2962208649\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebrospinal fluid analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lumbar puncture is generally not necessary in children with suspected SC. CSF cell counts, protein, and glucose are typically normal in SC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In patients with fever, encephalopathy, or other atypical features, lumbar puncture may be performed to exclude other causes of chorea (eg, encephalitis). (See <a href=\"#H956339\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2861700682\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients who have clinical features consistent with SC, neuroimaging usually does not provide additional diagnostic or prognostic information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, neuroimaging may be necessary to exclude other causes of chorea in patients with atypical clinical findings (eg, hemichorea), those with risk factors for cerebrovascular disease (eg, sickle cell disease, mitochondrial disease), or in the absence of supporting evidence of GAS infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Computed tomography is generally not helpful in the evaluation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in SC are variable and there are no pathognomonic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. MRI is normal in many patients. MRI abnormalities reported in some patients with SC include foci of T2 hyperintensity in the basal ganglia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cerebral white matter, which may be isolated or multifocal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p>Although not routinely done, positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computer tomography (SPECT) may demonstrate abnormal basal ganglia metabolism or perfusion and may be helpful in patients with atypical clinical presentations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/10,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2269271088\"><span class=\"h2\">Other tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional testing may be required to exclude other causes of chorea, particularly in children with atypical features. (See <a href=\"#H956339\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>If there is any uncertainty about the diagnosis, and in all cases of recurrent chorea, we screen for systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome with antinuclear antibodies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with seizures, atypical psychiatric features (eg, hallucinations), altered sensorium, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progressive neurologic symptoms, and those without evidence of GAS infection, we evaluate for anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis by measuring specific anti-NMDA receptor antibodies in the serum and CSF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37474361\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of SC is made clinically based on the characteristic findings (eg, chorea, emotional lability, and hypotonia) in the absence of other identifiable causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The presence of carditis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> evidence of recent GAS infection are supportive findings, but are not necessary to establish the diagnosis; their absence should increase vigilance for other autoimmune, vascular, or metabolic diagnoses. (See <a href=\"#H956339\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H100642919\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H956339\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subacute onset chorea in childhood is nearly always autoimmune, and the vast majority of these cases in children are SC. Subacute chorea can also result from other acquired causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F95650\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95650 \">table 2</a>) (eg, viral or autoimmune encephalitis, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], stroke, hyperthyroidism) and from drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F95651\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95651 \">table 3</a>). In most cases, SC can be distinguished from these disorders on the basis of the history of the illness, family history, and neurologic examination. In patients with atypical features, neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> additional testing (eg, antinuclear antibodies to screen for SLE) may be necessary to exclude alternative diagnoses. The approach to children with chorea is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperkinetic movement disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Chorea, athetosis, and ballismus'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chorea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chorea&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tics that occur in childhood (eg, Tourette syndrome) can be distinguished from chorea by history and physical examination. The patterned, repetitive appearance, the ability to temporarily suppress tics, and the premonitory sensations that often precede tics help to differentiate these movements from chorea. In SC, tics and chorea may co-occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tourette-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tourette syndrome&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of patients with SC consists of chronic antibiotic therapy to prevent recurrence and minimize the risk of rheumatic heart disease. In addition, patients with significant impairment related to their chorea may be treated with chorea-suppressing medication <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with immune-suppressing treatment (ie, corticosteroids). In patients with moderate to severe chorea, referral to a child neurologist or movement disorder specialist can help guide management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28778569\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pending throat culture results <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serologic markers of group A streptococcal (GAS) infection, patients with SC are started on antibiotic therapy to eradicate GAS carriage. Treatment should proceed as delineated for management of acute GAS pharyngitis, whether or not pharyngitis is present at the time of diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64596\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64596 \">table 4</a>). In practice, the most convenient and sensible approach is to administer long-acting intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-benzathine-long-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G benzathine</a>, which serves two purposes: to eradicate GAS carriage and also as the first dose of secondary prophylaxis.

Chorea can interfere with dressing and other activities of daily living, as well as with school tasks, such as writing. If interference is moderate to severe, particularly if gait is affected and there is a risk of falls, short-term treatment may be warranted. We typically use a low-dose high-potency dopamine 2 (D2) receptor blocking agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluphenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluphenazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimozide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimozide</a>). A potential complication of this therapy is an acute drug-induced movement disorder such as akathisia or dystonia. If this develops, anticholinergic treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benztropine-benzatropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benztropine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> followed by withdrawal or reduction of the D2 blocking agent is appropriate.</p><p>In milder cases of SC, or when clinicians or families are reluctant to try D2 blocking agents, other reasonable alternatives include valproic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guanfacine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">guanfacine</a>.</p><p>Most treatment studies involve small series of patients treated open-label, making it difficult to distinguish the benefit of medication from the expected spontaneous improvement over time.

It is one of the major clinical manifestations of acute rheumatic fever (ARF). It is seen in approximately one-third of cases of ARF, most often in school-aged children. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H458230982\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of SC usually begin one to eight months after the inciting infection. The onset is typically insidious but may be abrupt. Neurologic symptoms include chorea (ie, rapid, irregular, and nonstereotypic jerking movements of the limbs; restlessness of the trunk; facial grimacing), motor impersistence (characterized by &quot;milkmaid's grip&quot;) and interference with gross and fine motor control. The movements are continuous while the patient is awake, worsen with attempted action, and improve with sleep. The symptoms typically improve gradually, with a mean duration of 12 to 15 weeks (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Neurologic symptoms and signs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychiatric symptoms of SC include emotional changes (easy crying or inappropriate laughing), irritability, distractibility, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms can precede, occur concomitant with, or occur after the onset of chorea. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Psychiatric symptoms'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At least 30 percent of patients have clinical carditis in association with SC. However, a higher proportion of patients have carditis that is subclinical or resolved by the time that SC is diagnosed. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Association with other manifestations of rheumatic fever'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected SC includes testing for group A streptococcal (GAS) infection and a detailed cardiac evaluation, including electrocardiogram and echocardiography. In addition, inflammatory markers (ie, C-reactive protein <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> erythrocyte sedimentation rate) should be measured at the time of initial presentation, though these tests are typically normal. In children with atypical features (eg, hemichorea, fevers), cerebrospinal fluid analysis, neuroimaging, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> additional testing may help exclude other causes of chorea. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of SC is made clinically based on the characteristic findings (eg, chorea, emotional lability, and hypotonia) in the absence of other identifiable causes. The presence of carditis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> evidence of recent GAS infection are supportive findings but are not necessary to establish the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H37474361\" class=\"local\">'Clinical diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other causes of subacute chorea should be considered, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus. Numerous other conditions are associated with childhood chorea, including acquired causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F95650\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95650 \">table 2</a>), and drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F95651\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95651 \">table 3</a>). Most of these can be excluded on the basis of the history of the illness, family history, and neurologic examination. Referral to a child neurologist or movement disorder specialist can be helpful if there is uncertainty about the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H956339\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperkinetic-movement-disorders-in-children#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperkinetic movement disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Chorea, athetosis, and ballismus'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chorea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chorea&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients with SC, treatment consists of chronic antibiotic therapy to eradicate GAS, prevent recurrence, and minimize the risk of rheumatic heart disease. (See <a href=\"#H28778569\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Treatment and prevention&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with moderate to severe chorea that is associated with significant impairment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> risk of falls, we suggest both chorea-suppressing treatment with a dopamine 2 (D2) receptor blocking agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluphenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluphenazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimozide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimozide</a>) and immune modulation with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Valproic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guanfacine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">guanfacine</a> are reasonable alternative agents that can be used to suppress the chorea; however limited pediatric data are available. Based on observational studies and one small randomized trial, prednisone appears to shorten the duration of symptoms. Oral prednisone 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> is given daily for two weeks and then tapered over two to three weeks. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of chorea'</a> above and <a href=\"#H732972167\" class=\"local\">'Immune modulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with SC recover fully without treatment, with symptoms lasting from a few weeks to one year or more. Approximately 15 to 30 percent of individuals with SC experience a recurrence, usually within a few years of the initial episode. The risk is reduced, but not eliminated, by chronic treatment with prophylactic antibiotics. (See <a href=\"#H2753148785\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1488205201\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Robert P Cruse, DO, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sydenham-chorea/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">TARANTA A, STOLLERMAN GH.
