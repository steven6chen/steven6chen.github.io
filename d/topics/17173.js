Uncommonly diagnosed before the age of 40 except in familial CRC syndromes, the incidence of CRC steadily increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-in-elderly-patients-and-those-with-a-poor-performance-status/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately 70 percent of cases develop over the age of 65; 40 percent are 75 years or older. The United States Census bureau projects that by the year 2030 the number of Americans over age 65 will double [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-in-elderly-patients-and-those-with-a-poor-performance-status/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As a result, the number of patients over the age of 70 presenting for CRC care is expected to rise.</p><p>Although some patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) are potentially resectable for cure (particularly those with isolated liver metastases), treatment for most patients is palliative and generally consists of systemic chemotherapy. For decades, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU) was the sole active agent. This has changed markedly since the year 2000, with the approval of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a>, multiple molecularly targeted agents against the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aflibercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aflibercept</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramucirumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramucirumab</a>) and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=panitumumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">panitumumab</a>), and the oral multikinase inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regorafenib</a>. The most recent conventional chemotherapy addition is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trifluridine-and-tipiracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trifluridine-tipiracil</a> (TAS-102), an oral cytotoxic agent that consists of the nucleoside analog <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trifluridine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trifluridine</a> (a cytotoxic antimetabolite that inhibits thymidylate synthetase and induces DNA strand breaks) and tipiracil, a potent thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor, which inhibits trifluridine metabolism and has antiangiogenic properties as well. Most recently, two immune checkpoint inhibitors that target programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pembrolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pembrolizumab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nivolumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nivolumab</a>, have been approved for treatment of advanced microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) mCRC that has progressed following conventional chemotherapy.

However, in older patients, who may have age-related organ function decline and medical comorbidity, special attention must be paid to the risks of chemotherapy (both treatment-related toxicity and quality of life [QOL] issues), particularly in the context of estimated life expectancy. Age-related organ function changes that are relevant to the treatment of patients with CRC are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57349\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57349 \">table 1</a>). A thorough discussion of the age-related changes that should be considered when assessing the risk of systemic chemotherapy for mCRC is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic chemotherapy for cancer in elderly persons&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Quality of life issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quality of life (QOL) is a crucial component of decision-making when treating older patients. The available data suggest that older patients are just as willing to try chemotherapy as their younger counterparts, but less willing to endure severe treatment-related side effects.</p><p>There are few data about how chemotherapy affects QOL in older patients with mCRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-in-elderly-patients-and-those-with-a-poor-performance-status/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. A major issue is whether the higher response rates and generally longer survival seen with modern combination regimens (as compared with a strategy of sequential single agents) are outweighed by the greater likelihood of side effects and adverse impact on QOL. In one of the only trials to address this issue, the MRC FOCUS2 trial, 459 patients who were considered unfit for full-dose chemotherapy because of advanced age alone (29 percent), frailty (32 percent), or both (38 percent) were randomly assigned, using a 2x2 factorial design, to short-term infusional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> with or without oxaliplatin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-in-elderly-patients-and-those-with-a-poor-performance-status/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The median age was 74, with 43 percent of patients older than 75, and 13 percent older than 80 years of age; 29 percent had a performance status of 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the factorial comparison, the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> to either fluoropyrimidine was associated with significantly higher response rates and a trend toward better progression-free and overall survival that was not statistically significant. However, the use of oxaliplatin had a detrimental impact on QOL, with significantly fewer patients reporting improved global QOL at week 12 to 14 (49 versus 62 percent, p = 0.04).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>QOL improvement was the primary outcome measure for the comparison of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> versus short-term infusional FU plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a>. Rates of improved global QOL at 12 to 14 weeks were the same in both groups (56 percent), despite more treatment-related side effects with capecitabine.</p><p/><p>This study is described in more detail below. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Oxaliplatin/FU combinations'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Capecitabine'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Measures of physical function and reserve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Age-related changes in physical health vary widely among individuals. Chronological age is a poor marker of a patient's functional status. Several methods of functional assessment are available.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Performance status</strong> &ndash; The most common method to measure physiologic reserve and functional status in cancer patients is the clinician estimated performance status (PS). There are two widely used scales, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 2</a>) and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 \">table 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Both the ECOG PS and KPS are useful to assess a patient's ability to tolerate chemotherapy and to assess short-term prognosis. Regardless of age, patients with a poor PS (eg, ECOG PS &gt;2, KPS &lt;60) usually tolerate chemotherapy poorly and have a short median overall survival. However, PS tends to underrepresent the degree of functional impairment in the older patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic chemotherapy for cancer in elderly persons&quot;, section on 'Assessments of physical function and reserve'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Studies addressing management of patients with mCRC and a poor performance status (who may not necessarily be elderly) are presented below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ADL and IADL scales</strong> &ndash; A more comprehensive understanding of an older patient's functional state can be obtained by use of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scales. ADL refers to the skills that are necessary for basic living, and include feeding, grooming, transferring, and toileting. IADL refers to the skills required to live independently in the community, including shopping, managing finances, housekeeping, preparing meals, and the ability to take medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Comprehensive geriatric assessment</strong> &ndash; Assessment of functional status with the ADL and IADL scales is a component of the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) that is used by geriatricians to identify frail older patients at high risk of adverse outcomes such as falls, hospitalization, and death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frailty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frailty&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Incorporating a more thorough geriatric assessment of function using the CGA can aid treatment decision-making in older cancer patients. There is no uniform CGA measurement tool, but all include some multidisciplinary assessment of the following domains: physical function, comorbid conditions, psychological state, social support, cognitive function, nutrition, and polypharmacy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F68620\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68620 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comprehensive-geriatric-assessment-for-patients-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comprehensive geriatric assessment for patients with cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Guiding treatment decisions by assessment of physical function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is general agreement that frail older adults, those with significant functional impairment or an ECOG PS of 3 to 4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 2</a>), should be supported with palliative measures aimed at maintaining QOL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-in-elderly-patients-and-those-with-a-poor-performance-status/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There is also general agreement that active, fit, older patients without comorbidity should be treated in the same fashion as younger patients with mCRC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F68620\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68620 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>The patients who are neither frail nor fit are the patients in whom treatment decision-making is most complex. Their treatment requires excellent communication and individualized care.</p><p>Validated models have been developed that can be useful in predicting which patients are at increased risk of developing severe or fatal toxicity from chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-in-elderly-patients-and-those-with-a-poor-performance-status/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Parameters included within this model include age, type of cancer, the proposed chemotherapy regimen, renal and hematologic function, hearing, and activity levels from the CGA (ability to take medications, physical activity, social activity). These parameters have been combined into a model that can be useful in predicting which patients are at increased risk of developing severe or fatal toxicity from chemotherapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F78775\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78775 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60649\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60649 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-in-elderly-patients-and-those-with-a-poor-performance-status/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Although such patients have a median survival that is approximately half that seen for patients with a PS of 0 or 1, they benefit to an equal extent from combination chemotherapy.</p><p>The influence of PS on the efficacy and toxicity of first-line chemotherapy was addressed in a pooled analysis of nine trials with over 6200 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-in-elderly-patients-and-those-with-a-poor-performance-status/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Patients with PS of 2 derived similar advantages with regard to efficacy from superior (ie, combination versus single agent) chemotherapy as did those with a PS of 0 to 1, but with a significantly higher risk of &ge;grade 3 nausea and vomiting. The median survival for patients with a PS of 2 was less than nine months, and 12 percent died within 60 days of the start of treatment.</p><p>Even selected patients with PS 3 to 4 may benefit from chemotherapy, with upfront dose reduction and close monitoring for toxicity to minimize the risk for serious adverse events. In an analysis of 65 patients with mCRC and an ECOG PS 3 or 4, chemotherapy use led to a survival gain (median 6.8 versus 2.3 months for best supportive care) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-for-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-in-elderly-patients-and-those-with-a-poor-performance-status/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p>The choice of regimen is unclear.

However, in older patients, who may have age-related organ function decline and medical comorbidity, special attention must be paid to the risks of chemotherapy (treatment-related toxicity and quality of life [QOL] issues), particularly in the context of estimated life expectancy. Serious comorbidity negatively impacts survival and increases the complexity of cancer management in this population. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Challenges specific to the elderly'</a> above.)</p><p>Treatment decisions should not be based upon age alone, but upon functional status, the presence of comorbidities, and consideration of drug-specific toxicities that can be worse in older individuals because of their diminished reserve:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, fit elderly patients with mCRC derive as much benefit from chemotherapy as do younger patients, with only a minor increase in expected toxicity. We recommend that these patients be offered combination chemotherapy, including a biologic agent, if appropriate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combination chemotherapy should be used cautiously, given in attenuated doses initially, or be avoided altogether in frail older patients (particularly those with severe comorbidity, poor physical function). In this population, sequential single agent therapy is a probably preferable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, if the decline in physical function is entirely related to cancer, treatment should be considered, as patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 2</a>) appear to benefit from chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Management of patients with a poor performance status'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of elderly patients are neither fit nor frail. Individualized treatment decision-making is paramount in this group as presently there is no evidence to support or refute the benefit and safety of therapy. However, we strongly encourage physicians to at least discuss treatment with these patients and to tailor it (particularly for patients with cognitive or functional impairment) by starting with attenuated doses in combination regimens or single agents, escalating intensity as tolerated. The default of simply omitting chemotherapy is no longer acceptable. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Safety and efficacy of chemotherapy for metastatic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following represents our general approach to <strong>initial</strong> treatment for fit elderly patients with mCRC, which mirrors our approach to non-elderly patients and is outlined in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109247\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109247 \">algorithm 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-chemotherapy-for-nonoperable-metastatic-colorectal-cancer-treatment-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic chemotherapy for nonoperable metastatic colorectal cancer: Treatment recommendations&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For fit, relatively healthy elderly patients, we suggest a chemotherapy doublet (FOLFOX, XELOX, or FOLFIRI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64504 \">table 12</a>) rather than a fluoropyrimidine alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The choice among these regimens may be driven by toxicity concerns. Given the small increased risk of neutropenia, we often omit the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU) bolus from both FOLFOX (eg, modified FOLFOX7) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F63338\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63338 \">table 15</a>) and FOLFIRI in order to diminish treatment-related cytopenias.

However, the potential for improved outcomes from the addition of bevacizumab to first-line therapy must be balanced against the potential for serious treatment-related toxicity. Because patients over age 65 may be at increased risk of a bevacizumab-induced arterial thromboembolic event, bevacizumab should only be used with informed consent regarding these risks. In patients with a personal history of stroke or active coronary heart disease, the benefit offered by bevacizumab is likely outweighed by the risk of an arterial thrombotic event.
