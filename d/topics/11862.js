Clinicians who choose to try NIV in this setting should monitor such patients closely. Improved consciousness should be apparent within one to two hours after the initiation of NIV. Patients who deteriorate or fail to improve should be promptly intubated. The likelihood that hypercapnic encephalopathy will respond to NIV is inversely related to the severity of the hypercapnia. Respiratory acidosis is NOT a contraindication to NIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>Patients with one or more contraindications should forgo a trial of NIV.

Most commonly, NIV is initiated in the emergency department, intensive care unit, or a specialized respiratory unit, although the optimal setting has not been formally studied and varies among hospitals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventilator type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NIV can be delivered via the standard type of ventilator found in most intensive care units (ICUs) or a portable ventilator. However, the standard ICU ventilator has numerous advantages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A precise concentration of oxygen can be delivered</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High concentrations of oxygen can be delivered</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Separate inspiratory and expiratory tubing minimizes the rebreathing of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large mask leaks <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> patient disconnection are more readily detected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Better monitoring and alarm features</p><p/><p>In addition, certain modes can only be delivered with a standard ICU ventilator (eg, time-limited pressure support ventilation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Interface</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient-ventilator interfaces available for NIV include a full face mask, oronasal mask, nasal mask, and nasal prongs (pillows) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70053\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70053 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76935\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76935 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75445\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75445 \">picture 3</a>). The full face mask includes the eyes, nose, and mouth, while the oronasal mask includes the nose and mouth, but not the eyes. The oronasal mask is sometimes referred to as a face mask. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Types of noninvasive nocturnal ventilatory support in neuromuscular and chest wall disease&quot;, section on 'Interfaces'</a>.)</p><p>Straps hold the interface in place and should be adjusted to avoid excess pressure on the nose or face. Generally, the straps should be loose enough to allow one or two fingers to pass between the face and the strap. When a nasal mask or prongs are used, a chin strap is usually necessary to maintain closure of the mouth.</p><p>The efficacy of the various interfaces has been examined in a few studies. Three interfaces were compared in a trial that randomly assigned 26 patients with a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation complicated by hypercapnia to receive NIV via face mask, nasal mask, or nasal prongs (pillows) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The face mask conferred the greatest physiologic improvement, but the nasal mask was best tolerated. In an observational study, 36 patients with a do-not-intubate order were treated with NIV for acute respiratory failure with an orofacial mask [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Of these, 24 did not improve with the orofacial mask and were switched to a full face mask, which led to improvement in 23. A study that randomly assigned 90 patients to nasal or orofacial mask found that more than one-half of patients initially treated using a nasal mask needed to be changed to a face mask [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This was usually due to a significant air leak through the mouth.</p><p>Based on these studies, the oronasal mask is generally preferred over a nasal mask or nasal prongs during the initiation of NIV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55475\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55475 \">table 3</a>). For patients who fail to achieve adequate improvement in gas exchange or experience excess nasal pressure with the oronasal mask, the full face mask may be a better option. Whichever mask is selected, it is helpful to keep the following points in mind:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with acute respiratory failure are mouth breathers; therefore, NIV delivered by a nasal mask or prongs (pillows) may result in a large air leak through the mouth and a worse outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nasal air passages offer significant resistance to airflow, which can reduce the beneficial effects of NIV if a low level of positive airway pressure is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/20,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary disadvantage of the full face and oronasal masks is that monitoring for aspiration is more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regardless of the interface chosen, heated humidification brings the relative humidity back toward the ambient range. This enhances patient comfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p>A helmet interface has been developed that may improve patient tolerance, an important factor in the success of NIV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F108315\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108315 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. The helmet interface allows patients to talk, read, and drink through a straw, while minimizing complications such as skin necrosis, gastric distension, and eye irritation. Mechanically, the helmet behaves as a reservoir between the ventilator and the patient. High flow and short inspiratory time are required to pressurize the helmet rapidly. Drawbacks of the helmet device include the accumulation of CO<sub>2</sub> within the helmet (alleviated by increasing gas flow rates), a level of noise exposure sufficiently high to cause hearing damage, more patient-ventilator asynchrony (due to delayed triggering and cycling), and less relief of inspiratory effort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. Helmets are not widely commercially available in the United States, and their use is investigational. Data discussing the potential efficacy of helmet-delivered NIV in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome are discussed separately.

The terms &quot;BiPAP&quot; and &quot;BIPAP&quot; are often used incorrectly to refer to NIV in the BPAP mode. BiPAP is a specific type of BPAP delivered by a portable ventilator manufactured by the Respironics Corporation, while BIPAP is a specific type of BPAP delivered by a ventilator made by the Drager Medical Company. These are just two of the ventilators that can deliver BPAP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Bilevel positive airway pressure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proportional assist ventilation (PAV) delivers an inspiratory pressure that is proportional to patient effort. Specifically, it is determined by patient-generated volume and flow. PAV provides automatic synchrony between the patient and the ventilatory cycle.</p><p/><p>Controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV), intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV), synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV), and pressure controlled ventilation (PCV) are seldom used during NIV.

Relatively few studies have directly compared NIV modes in patients with acute respiratory failure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute respiratory failure due to a variety of causes &ndash; Three randomized trials demonstrated that PAV and PSV had similar impact on intubation rates and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbations &ndash; Two randomized trials found that AC reduced the work of breathing more than PSV, but PSV was better tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>], while several studies found that BPAP improved gas exchange and reduced the work of breathing more effectively than PSV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. In addition, BPAP has proven efficacy in randomized trials and is generally the preferred mode of choice for NIV. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'COPD exacerbation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute respiratory failure due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema &ndash; A meta-analysis (23 randomized trials) found no difference in mortality when BPAP and CPAP were directly compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Both BPAP and CPAP reduced mortality and the intubation rate compared to standard therapy. Similarly, a randomized trial that compared PSV to CPAP found no difference in either mortality or the frequency of intubations, although respiratory distress appeared to resolve sooner among patients who received PSV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Asynchrony</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients do not tolerate NIV. This is often due to patient-ventilator asynchrony (ie, the phases of ventilator breath do not match that of the patient) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Asynchrony'</a>.)</p><p>PSV tends to be a comfortable mode and may minimize asynchrony. It allows the patient to trigger each breath and independently regulate the depth and pattern of breathing. It is reasonable to expect that BPAP provides a similar level of comfort, although this has not been studied.</p><p>PAV may be helpful in patients who do not tolerate PSV or BPAP. It has the advantage of having an inspiratory flow and delivered volume that is proportional to the patient's effort. Cessation of inspiration is determined entirely by the patient, allowing the patient to control the entire respiratory cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Three randomized trials compared PAV to PSV in patients with acute respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. Each found that PAV was more comfortable and better tolerated than PSV. However, there was no difference in mortality or intubation rates.</p><p>The mode is not the only consideration when patient-ventilator asynchrony exists; the possibility of a mask leak should always be investigated. A mask leak can increase the time required for the ventilator to achieve its pressure target, prolonging inspiration and causing discomfort. Having the PSV time-limited (rather than flow-limited) can improve this situation, although only certain ventilators are capable of delivering time-limited PSV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Settings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The selected mode determines which parameters need to be set during the initiation of NIV. As an example, AC requires that a tidal volume, respiratory rate, inspiratory flow rate, applied positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) be set. The parameters that need to be set for each mode are described elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The initial settings for NIV are similar to those for invasive positive pressure ventilation.

One reasonable protocol for initiating BPAP is outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51201\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51201 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After NIV is initiated, the patient should be observed closely for the first eight hours to troubleshoot, provide reassurance, and monitor for deterioration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Improvement of the pH and arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) within one-half to two hours predicts success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/26,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,48</a>]. In contrast, a patient should be considered to have failed NIV and promptly intubated if there is neither stabilization nor improvement over the same time frame. Other criteria suggesting failure are worse encephalopathy or agitation, inability to clear secretions, inability to tolerate any of the interfaces, hemodynamic instability, or decreased oxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>In general, the ability of clinicians to select patients with a high likelihood of success is poor and NIV failure rates are high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/48,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,56,57</a>].

The risks (worsening respiratory failure prompting intubation) and benefits (avoiding intubation due to improved tolerance of NIV) of sedatives and analgesics are poorly studied.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p>A trial of NIV is worthwhile for a variety of patients. The following recommendations pertain to patients who do not require emergent intubation and lack contraindications to NIV (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) complicated by hypercapnic acidosis (PaCO<sub>2</sub> &gt;45 mmHg or pH &lt;7.30) who do not require emergent intubation and lack contraindications to NIV, we recommend a trial of bilevel NIV (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'COPD exacerbation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, we recommend a trial of NIV or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Cardiogenic pulmonary edema'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure due to causes other than cardiogenic pulmonary edema, we suggest an early trial of NIV (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). It is unknown whether or not this practice benefits patients with hypoxemic patients who are immunocompromised. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Hypoxemic respiratory failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with an asthma exacerbation who continue to have severe symptoms despite initial bronchodilator therapy, we suggest a trial of NIV (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Asthma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NIV may be beneficial in preventing recurrent respiratory failure following extubation if employed early. This is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extubation-management#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extubation management&quot;, section on 'Postextubation management'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Once a patient has been selected to receive a trial of NIV, it should be initiated as soon as possible. Patients who fail to improve or stabilize within one-half to two hours should be promptly intubated. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Initiation'</a> above.)</p><p>NIV is generally safe. Most complications are local and related to the tightly fitting mask. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Potential harms'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516823111\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Kristy Bauman, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Maheshwari V, Paioli D, Rothaar R, Hill NS.
