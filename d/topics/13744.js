Normally, the placenta is not near the cervix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82935\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82935 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Placenta previa can cause severe bleeding from the vagina.</p><p>Placenta previa is more likely in women who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Had more than one c-section &ndash; A c-section is a type of surgery used to deliver a baby. It is also called a &quot;cesarean delivery.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Had placenta previa in a previous pregnancy </p><p/><p>Other things that can make placenta previa more likely are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giving birth several times before</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being pregnant with more than one baby at a time</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103098970\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of placenta previa?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women leak blood from the vagina. In some women, the uterus also tightens. Doctors call this &quot;contractions.&quot; The belly can feel hard during contractions.</p><p>A few women do not have any symptoms of placenta previa.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103098985\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for placenta previa?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or midwife can order a test called an &quot;ultrasound.&quot; This is an imaging test that creates pictures of the baby inside the woman's body. It also shows the placenta.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103099000\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are pregnant and leaking blood from your vagina, call your doctor, nurse, or midwife right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103099015\"><span class=\"h1\">How is placenta previa treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor, nurse, or midwife will tell you not to have sex. Sex can make the placenta previa bleed. Putting anything deep in the vagina can make the placenta previa bleed.</p><p>Treatment depends on your symptoms and how far along you are in your pregnancy. If placenta previa does not cause bleeding, you might have an ultrasound every few weeks to check it. The placenta sometimes moves into a normal position.</p><p>If you have a placenta previa that is bleeding, even a little bit, you will probably need treatment in the hospital right away. Your doctor or midwife will:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check your heart rate and blood pressure &ndash; He or she will also check the baby's heart rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check how much you are bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you fluids through an &quot;IV&quot; &ndash; This is a thin tube that goes into a vein. The fluids help keep your blood flow and blood pressure as normal as possible.</p><p/><p>If the bleeding is heavy and does not slow down, your doctor might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you a blood transfusion &ndash; This is when you get blood that was donated by another person.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deliver the baby with a c-section, even if it means the baby comes early.</p><p/><p>Most women who have placenta previa do not need to deliver the baby the first time they have bleeding. Some women might need to stay in the hospital until they give birth, but other women can go home when the bleeding stops. While you are in the hospital, your doctor or midwife might give you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iron pills, if you lost a lot of blood</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid medicines &ndash; These help the baby's lungs get ready for birth, if it could be born early. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A shot of &quot;Rh <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">immune globulin</a>&quot; if you are Rh-negative (which means your blood cells do not have a protein called &quot;Rh factor&quot;)</p><p/><p>If the placenta previa does not go away, your doctor will deliver the baby with a c-section about a month before your due date. This is because labor and vaginal delivery with placenta previa will cause severe bleeding. This is dangerous for you and your baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103099030\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-to-expect-in-the-nicu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What to expect in the NICU (The Basics)</a> </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
