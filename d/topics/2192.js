It uses high doses of X-rays, called radiation, to kill cancer cells. There are 2 types of radiation therapy, depending on where the source of the radiation is.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In &quot;external-beam radiation therapy,&quot; the radiation comes from a machine that is outside the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In &quot;internal radiation therapy,&quot; the radiation comes from a source, such as tiny seeds or capsules, that is put inside the body. Brachytherapy is another name for internal radiation therapy.</p><p/><p>In brachytherapy, a doctor puts the source of radiation into or right next to the cancer. The radiation affects only the cancer and the area right around the cancer. The radiation does not affect other parts of the body.</p><p>There are 2 types of brachytherapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-dose rate (LDR) &ndash; A doctor puts the radiation source into the cancer and leaves it there. The source gives off radiation for weeks to months. After that, it doesn't give off any more radiation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-dose rate (HDR) &ndash; A doctor puts the radiation source into the cancer for a short time (hours to days) and then removes it from the body.</p><p/><p>Doctors can use brachytherapy to treat different types of cancers. These often include cancers of the prostate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65675\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65675 \">figure 1</a>), breast, cervix, and lining of the uterus (endometrium) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 2</a>). Some people have brachytherapy along with external-beam radiation therapy or other cancer treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25056381\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during brachytherapy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will do a procedure to put the radiation source into your body. He or she will give you medicines to make you feel sleepy or numb. He or she will put a thin tube into your body near the area with the cancer. Then he or she will put the radiation through the tube and into the cancer.</p><p>For LDR brachytherapy, the doctor will remove the tube and leave the radiation in place. People can then usually leave the hospital.</p><p>To get HDR brachytherapy, people need to stay in the hospital. During treatment, people get a certain number of radiation doses, depending on their cancer. For each dose, the doctor will put the radiation through the tube and into the cancer. After a certain amount of time, the doctor will take the radiation out. He or she will repeat this as many times as needed over days or weeks. The tube might stay in place for the whole treatment, or it might come out and go back in each time.</p><p>People who get brachytherapy might need to avoid others, especially children, at certain times during treatment. That's because people can give off radiation when they have a source of radiation in their body. Your doctor or nurse will tell you if and when you need to stay away from other people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25056388\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the side effects of brachytherapy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People can have different side effects from brachytherapy. The side effects will depend on the type of brachytherapy, the radiation dose, and the body part involved. Depending on your treatment, your doctor will tell you the side effects you are likely to have.</p><p>Common side effects from brachytherapy can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling inside the body in the area around the radiation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness or soreness where the tube was put in on the outside of the body</p><p/><p>Your doctor can treat the side effects in different ways, depending on your symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25056395\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When you get brachytherapy, it's important to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow all of your doctor's instructions about treatments and visits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Let your doctor or nurse know about any side effects or problems you have during treatment, or if your health changes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take care of yourself by eating well, getting enough sleep, and exercising. To keep your energy up, try to eat foods and drinks with a lot of protein and calories.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25056402\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-loss-of-appetite-and-weight-loss-with-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing loss of appetite and weight loss with cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hair-loss-from-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hair loss from cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-with-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting with cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-your-cancer-treatment-makes-you-tired-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When your cancer treatment makes you tired (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
