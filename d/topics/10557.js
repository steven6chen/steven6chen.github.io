Early recognition that a patient's airway may be difficult to manage allows the clinician to plan the anesthetic to minimize the potential for serious airway-related morbidity.</p><p>In the unanticipated difficult airway, a pre-formulated strategy for airway management may reduce the likelihood of adverse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Difficulty may occur with facemask ventilation, placement of a supraglottic airway (SGA), laryngoscopy, and tracheal intubation. Other significant airway-related complications include aspiration of gastric contents, laryngospasm, and bronchospasm. These airway problems may occur in combination, leading to serious morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic will review patient factors that predict difficult airway management, the development of strategies for the initial management of the predicted difficult airway in the operating room environment, management of the unanticipated difficult airway during induction of general anesthesia, and extubation of the patient with a difficult airway. A general approach to airway management and specific techniques and devices used to manage the airway are discussed separately, as is an approach to the difficult airway during emergency intubation.

One goal of this evaluation is to predict the degree of difficulty with ventilation and intubation. Prediction that a patient will be difficult to mask ventilate, ventilate with a supraglottic airway (SGA), or intubate leads to different airway management strategies, particularly when more than one airway technique is likely to be problematic. The airway history and examination, including factors that predict difficulty with airway management, are discussed more fully separately.

The degree of difficulty varies and depends on both the number of predictive factors and the skill of the clinician.

Those with the highest predictive value for a difficult direct laryngoscopy are a prior history of a difficult intubation, a short thyromental distance, and decreased range of motion of the neck. The greater the number of positive findings, the more likely intubation will be difficult.

The following discussion is applicable to the anesthetic care of these patients based on clinical assessment or prior history of difficulty. Creation of a general strategy for airway management is discussed more fully elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia#H717871222\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway management for induction of general anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Creation of a strategy for airway management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H881472472\"><span class=\"h2\">Difficult airway guidelines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and other organizations have developed guidelines for management of the patient with a difficult airway that include algorithms to aid in clinical decision-making (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94447\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94447 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/1,3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-5</a>]. A fundamental recommendation of these guidelines is for the performance of a thorough, pre-management assessment of the airway and other mitigating patient factors, with the goal of identifying patients at risk. Advanced recognition enables the practitioner to formulate a specific management plan that includes the possibility of securing the airway before induction of general anesthesia (ie, awake intubation). The algorithms proceed through specific decision points based on the success of the initial plan and the likelihood of success of backup techniques. Structured training and use of these algorithms for difficult airways may decrease airway-related morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Experienced personnel and specialized airway equipment are critical when airway management is difficult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H881472485\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway Approach Algorithm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to developing an initial airway management strategy for the patient with a predicted difficult airway is summarized in the Airway Approach Algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94754\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94754 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This algorithm consists of a series of five clinical questions that lead the clinician to one of two entry points of the ASA Difficult Airway Algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94447\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94447 \">algorithm 1</a>): awake intubation or intubation after induction of general anesthesia. The goal of this approach is to avoid entering the emergency pathway of the algorithm (ie, the &quot;cannot intubate, cannot ventilate&quot; scenario). The questions used to direct airway management in the Airway Approach Algorithm include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is airway control required?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Could laryngoscopy be difficult?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Could supraglottic ventilation be used?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there risk of aspiration?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Will the patient tolerate a period of apnea?</p><p/><p>The answers to these questions are combined to create a strategy for airway management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183541\"><span class=\"h2\">Regional versus general anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If appropriate for the surgical procedure, regional or local anesthesia may be preferable for the patient with a potentially difficult airway. Some patients, however, may require unanticipated airway manipulation or conversion to general anesthesia if the regional technique fails or is insufficient to complete the surgical procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/1,3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,9</a>]. Thus, a plan must still be made to manage the airway for patients having regional anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In some cases, general anesthesia with elective management of the airway may be preferred in order to avoid an emergent difficult intubation, should conversion become necessary (eg, due to inadequate regional block). This decision should be made on a case-by-case basis based on the likelihood of the regional anesthetic being successful and sufficient for the duration of the case, the degree of predicted airway difficulty, access to the airway during the case, the clinician's experience, and the availability of specialized airway equipment and skilled assistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H881472517\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of airway control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients <strong>without</strong> a predicted difficult airway typically undergo anesthetic induction prior to intubation.

Airway topicalization can compromise airway protective reflexes and should be performed selectively, but thoroughly, in patients at high risk of aspiration. In such patients, the oropharynx can be anesthetized, and topical glossopharyngeal nerve blocks can be performed to blunt the gag reflex, but laryngeal and subglottic anesthesia should be avoided until immediately prior to intubation. This can be accomplished by spraying local anesthetic solution through the flexible bronchoscope as it is advanced during the process of laryngoscopy and intubation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-scope-intubation-for-anesthesia#H73901775\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible scope intubation for anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Topical anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The key to awake intubation in the patient with a full stomach is a smooth course, with avoidance of gagging, coughing, and vomiting. Whenever possible, the intubation should not be rushed. Rather, adequate time should be allowed for full local anesthetic effect. The rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) technique, which relies on the ability to intubate rapidly, may not be appropriate for the patient who may be difficult to intubate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-induction-and-intubation-rsii-for-anesthesia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence induction and intubation (RSII) for anesthesia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The patient will not tolerate an apneic period</strong> &ndash; The risk of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) desaturation is greatest in patients with certain risk factors (eg, patients who are obese, are pregnant, or have pulmonary disease, as well as pediatric patients) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56716 \">figure 1</a>). When difficult laryngoscopy is anticipated, awake intubation should be considered even when mask or SGA ventilation is predicted to be easy.</p><p/><p>The goal of awake intubation is to preserve spontaneous ventilation and patient cooperation while intubation is accomplished. Pediatric patients and those with cognitive disability, altered mental status, or extreme anxiety may not tolerate airway procedures while awake. When awake intubation is indicated but not feasible, induction of anesthesia with techniques that maintain spontaneous ventilation (eg, inhalation induction) may reduce the occurrence of failed airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A higher level of vigilance for the risk of aspiration or loss of the airway must be maintained. This may include preparations for an immediate surgical airway.

Because of the relatively low sensitivities, specificities, and predictive values of the commonly performed airway exams, this determination is based in large part on clinical experience, including experience with the specific technique to be used (eg, direct or indirect laryngoscopy).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laryngoscopy is predicted to be difficult, but ventilation by mask or SGA is predicted to be adequate, the patient is not at increased risk for aspiration, <strong>and</strong> the patient will tolerate an apneic period.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3654914303\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of induction technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravenous (IV) medication is used for induction of general anesthesia for most adult patients. If difficult airway management is predicted, IV induction is used when there is a high likelihood of successful ventilation by mask, SGA, or endotracheal intubation and the patient is not at significant risk of gastric contents aspiration or rapid oxyhemoglobin desaturation. When maintenance of spontaneous ventilation throughout airway management is preferred, an inhalation induction may be used, though IV access should be established prior to inhalation induction. (See <a href=\"#H341130\" class=\"local\">'Inhalation induction'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3743067273\"><span class=\"h1\">PLANNING THE AIRWAY MANAGEMENT APPROACH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1136745059\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of airway device</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endotracheal intubation is considered by many to be the definitive method of airway control for patients receiving general anesthesia. Not every patient, however, requires endotracheal intubation, including even the patient with a potentially difficult airway. Regardless of the technique chosen for airway management, a backup plan must be in place, with the necessary expertise and equipment immediately available. Techniques for use and various types of airway management devices are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Devices for difficult emergency airway management outside the operating room in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Facemask</strong> &ndash; Apart from the patient breathing spontaneously (with or without a general anesthetic), facemask ventilation is the most basic of airway management techniques. It can be used for short cases when the anesthesiologist will have full access to the patient's airway throughout the procedure. An advantage to facemask airway management for the patient who may be difficult to intubate is that spontaneous ventilation can be maintained throughout the anesthetic. If mask ventilation is chosen, the surgeon must agree that the procedure could be interrupted for airway control during the case, if necessary. (See <a href=\"#H341136\" class=\"local\">'Mask or supraglottic airway ventilation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Supraglottic airway</strong> <strong>(SGA)</strong> &ndash; Many patients who are predicted to be difficult to intubate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mask ventilate can be successfully ventilated with a SGA. SGAs can be considered for use as the primary airway device when the risk of aspiration is relatively low and the need for higher airway pressures is not anticipated. A SGA specifically designed to allow intubation through the device may be a good choice for the patient who may be difficult to intubate. For longer procedures (ie, &gt;3 hours) or for patients who will not be positioned supine, a second-generation SGA (with a gastric drain) should be strongly considered. (See <a href=\"#H341136\" class=\"local\">'Mask or supraglottic airway ventilation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supraglottic-devices-including-laryngeal-mask-airways-for-airway-management-for-anesthesia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supraglottic devices (including laryngeal mask airways) for airway management for anesthesia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endotracheal tube (ETT)</strong> &ndash; Most anesthesiologists consider endotracheal intubation to be the definitive form of airway control. The ETT affords the best protection of the airway against aspiration and allows controlled ventilation for long procedures performed in any position, with or without muscle relaxation and with high airway pressures if necessary. A comparison between SGA and ETT for airway management is discussed more fully elsewhere.

In such cases, a surgeon should be consulted as part of the airway management plan. The surgeon should be asked whether emergent cricothyrotomy, tracheostomy, or rigid bronchoscopy would likely succeed if the airway is lost. If so, the surgeon and instrumentation for a surgical airway should be at the bedside during attempts at airway control. If not, tracheostomy under local anesthesia may be indicated.

This includes obese, pregnant, and pediatric patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56716 \">figure 1</a>).

We prefer to use an intubating SGA as the initial rescue device after two failed attempts at direct laryngoscopy if mask ventilation is not adequate. An intubating SGA permits immediate ventilation and may facilitate intubation with a standard-size endotracheal tube, without the need for an airway exchange catheter.</p><p>Repeated instrumentation of the airway may lead to bleeding, edema, and deterioration of the ability to ventilate. For this reason, laryngoscopy attempts with any particular device should be limited.

Invasive airway management techniques include cricothyrotomy, surgical tracheotomy, and transtracheal jet ventilation. Choice of technique depends on the expertise of the clinician, availability of equipment and personnel, and technical patient factors.

While most of the problems that occur during extubation are minor, rarely they may result in hypoxic injury or death. Any patient who was at particular risk for difficult airway management at the beginning of anesthesia should be considered at risk for airway compromise at the end of the anesthetic.</p><p>A number of surgical and patient factors increase the risk of adverse events at the time of extubation, including preexisting airway difficulties, surgical or anesthetic events that have affected the airway, and restricted airway access because of surgical dressings or fixation devices (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F101428\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101428 \">table 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Prior to extubation of the difficult or at-risk airway, an extubation strategy must be formulated that includes a plan for reintubation if necessary, including the same assortment of personnel and equipment that were present at induction.</p><p>Prior to extubation, neuromuscular blockade should be reversed, and the patient should be normothermic, hemodynamically stable, and adequately spontaneously ventilating. Patients should be preoxygenated prior to extubation with administration of 100 percent oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and positive end-expiratory pressure or continuous positive airway pressure in order to maximize the safe apneic period if problems occur. The oropharynx should be thoroughly suctioned to remove blood and secretions, and a soft bite block should be placed between the patient's molars to prevent occlusion of the tracheal tube if the patient bites down during emergence. The patient with a difficult airway should be extubated when he or she is fully awake, responding to commands, and able to maintain his or her own airway. Supplemental O<sub>2</sub> should be provided by standard facemask, or portable CPAP device if indicated, immediately after extubation and continued while the patient is transported to the recovery room.</p><p>For the extubation of a patient with an at-risk airway, we place an airway exchange catheter (AEC) to facilitate reintubation, if necessary. The AEC is a 100-cm-long, flexible, hollow plastic tube designed to maintain access to the airway after extubation and can be used to guide reintubation by serving as a stylet. </p><p>Prior to extubation, the AEC is passed through the endotracheal tube (ETT) into the trachea prior to extubation, with the tip of the AEC just beyond the end of the ETT. The ETT is removed over the AEC, and the AEC is left in place in the trachea, taped securely, until the possible need for reintubation has passed. </p><p>An AEC carefully positioned above the carina is generally well-tolerated, allowing coughing, swallowing, and talking. Supplemental O<sub>2</sub> can be administered through the catheter if hypoxemia occurs, but should not be routinely performed, as barotrauma can result in cases of laryngospasm or other upper airway obstruction.</p><p>If reintubation is required, an ETT is passed over the AEC, often while performing direct or indirect laryngoscopy to retract soft tissue. Most complications associated with the use of an AEC (including patient discomfort, coughing, and barotrauma) result from too-deep insertion (ie, to the level of or past the carina).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3889272971\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFICULT AIRWAY MANAGEMENT IN THE TRAUMA PATIENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with traumatic injury should be presumed to have difficult airways. They should be treated with full stomach precautions, and depending on the specific injury, may be at risk for cervical spine injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults#H1929740\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Cervical spine immobilization'</a>.)</p><p>Airway management for trauma patients may be complicated by time pressure, hemodynamic instability, and lack of patient cooperation with examination and procedures.</p><p>Some of the management strategies that are usually followed for patients without traumatic injury may be inappropriate in patients with trauma. As examples, awakening the trauma patient after failure of airway management is rarely an option, and awake intubation may be impractical or contraindicated, even when an impossible to manage airway is recognized. Thus surgical front-of-neck access may the best first choice management option in some patients with trauma. An approach to difficult airway management in trauma patients is shown in an algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112959\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef112959 \">algorithm 3</a>).
