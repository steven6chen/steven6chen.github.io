Anemia is the medical term for when a person has too few red blood cells. Red blood cells are the cells in your blood that carry oxygen. If you have too few red blood cells, your body does not get all the oxygen it needs.</p><p>Autoimmune hemolytic anemia happens due to problems with the body's infection-fighting system, called the &quot;immune system.&quot; Normally, the immune system kills germs. If something goes wrong and the immune system starts to attack healthy cells, this is called an &quot;autoimmune&quot; response. If your immune system attacks and destroys your red blood cells, you get autoimmune hemolytic anemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12629232\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes autoimmune hemolytic anemia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors don't know what causes the condition in about half of the people who get it. In rare cases, certain medicines used to treat infections cause autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Other possible causes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections such as pneumonia and mononucleosis (also called &quot;mono&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain types of cancer, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma, and lymphoma. Lymphomas are cancers that affect cells of the immune system.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoimmune diseases such as lupus &ndash; In people with lupus, the immune system can attack cells and organs all over the body.</p><p/><p>But most people with these diseases do <strong>not</strong> get autoimmune hemolytic anemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12629249\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of autoimmune hemolytic anemia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms are the same as in other types of anemia. They might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pale skin or a pale color in the tissue that lines the inside of the eyelids &ndash; You can see this tissue (called &quot;conjunctiva&quot;) by gently pulling down your lower eyelid. The tissue will appear pale instead of its normal, pinkish-red color.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling very tired</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fast heartbeat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache and muscle pains</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12629264\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for autoimmune hemolytic anemia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Doctors use blood tests to check for autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The most important one is called the direct antiglobulin test (also called the &quot;Coombs test&quot;). This test checks for signs of an immune attack on your red blood cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12629279\"><span class=\"h1\">How is autoimmune hemolytic anemia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that make your body's immune system less active, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">prednisone</a> &ndash; This is usually the first thing doctors try.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove an organ called the spleen (called a &quot;splenectomy&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood transfusion (if the anemia is very severe)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medicines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">cyclophosphamide</a> (brand name: Cytoxan) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">rituximab</a> (brand name: Rituxan), if the treatments listed above are not working well </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the autoimmune hemolytic anemia is due to a condition like CLL or lupus, treatment of that condition might also treat the anemia.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3030284669\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=splenectomy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Splenectomy (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
