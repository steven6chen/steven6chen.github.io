As an example, 90 percent of cholecystectomies in the United States are performed laparoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for the surgical treatment of gallstone disease. This procedure results in less postoperative pain, better cosmesis, shorter hospital stays and disability from work than open cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/2-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-8</a>]. However, the overall serious complication rate in laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains higher than that seen in open cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

Patients with isolated obstructive jaundice with or without cholangitis should either have their CBD cleared with urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) preoperatively or with cholangiography and laparoscopic common duct exploration at the time of surgery. If ERCP is successful, the patient should electively be scheduled for cholecystectomy.

However, mild elevations have been reported even in the absence of these complications, and may be due to the passage of small stones, sludge, or pus.

Surgical site infection rates following laparoscopic cholecystectomy are generally lower compared with open cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Infection rates after laparoscopic cholecystectomy have ranged from 0 to 4 percent without antimicrobial prophylaxis, and 0 to 7 percent with prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/22-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-28</a>]. Multiple meta-analyses have demonstrated no significant differences in the incidence of surgical site infection for low-risk patients receiving or not receiving antimicrobial prophylaxis prior to elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/17,18,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,27-29</a>]. These trials have generally included 50 to 175 patients in each arm and have used a single dose of antibiotics administered just prior to surgery. However, a subsequent Japanese trial randomly assigned just over 1000 low-risk patients to no antibiotics or intravenous antibiotics given preoperatively, 12 hours and 24 hours postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The incidence of surgical site infection (0.8 versus 2.8 percent), and distant infection (0.2 versus 3.2 percent) were significantly lower for those who received perioperative antibiotics. Although the cost associated with antibiotic prophylaxis was greater, overall hospital costs that included the cost of treating infection were significantly less. Further investigation is needed to determine whether the infectious risk reduction of additional antibiotic doses outweighs&nbsp;the&nbsp;risks of toxicity or bacterial drug resistance associated with increased&nbsp;antibiotic usage. </p><p>However, for patients at an increased risk for infectious complications, antimicrobial prophylaxis is warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].

Bleeding was defined as that which could not be controlled by standard surgical techniques, led to conversion to an open procedure, or necessitated transfusion, reoperation, or prolonging hospital stay. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H114901628\"><span class=\"h2\">Equipment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An angled laparoscope is recommended (typically a 30 degree) to facilitate alternative views of the operative field. Two grasping forceps are needed, one for the assistant and one for the surgeon. Toothed graspers may be helpful for particularly thick-walled, edematous gallbladders.</p><p>For the assistant, a ratchet mechanism, which locks the grasper closed, will help alleviate fatigue. A fine curved dissecting forceps can be used to dissect around delicate structures. Scissors are important for transection, and a hook or spatula with monopolar cautery is used for dissection. A clip applier is typically used to seal the cystic duct and artery.</p><p>Other tools that should be available include a <span class=\"nowrap\">suction/irrigation</span> device, cholangiogram catheters (4-5 French), retrieval bag, endoscopic ligating loops, appropriate trocars (we use a Hasson [blunt-tipped trocar for open insertion], 11 mm, and 2 X 5 mm), endoscopic needle holders, and a Veress needle (if percutaneous technique used).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">STANDARD PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is performed under general anesthesia. The generally short duration of the procedure minimizes the need for gastric decompression or placement of a urinary bladder catheter. The following sections describe the technique of a standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The technical details such as suture choice presented here reflect the author's preferences and are not meant to imply that these are requirements for successful surgical outcomes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is placed in a supine position on the operating room table. During abdominal access and insufflation of the abdomen, the table can remain flat. Thereafter, the patient should be placed in a reverse Trendelenburg position with left side down to allow gravity to aid with exposure of the gallbladder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52727\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52727 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In North American positioning, the patient is placed supine on the operating room table. The surgeon stands on the patient's left and the assistant on the right. The camera operator stands to the surgeon's left. The primary video monitor should be placed on the right at the level of the shoulder. A second monitor can be placed on the surgeon's right.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the European style, the patient is placed supine with legs abducted, and the surgeon stands between the legs. The camera operator is positioned to the patient's left, and the assistant to the right (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52727\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52727 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H114901272\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial entry into the abdomen is typically obtained at the umbilicus using either an open (Hasson) or closed (Veress needle) technique. Both techniques are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery#H651891356\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Peritoneal access'</a>.) </p><p>The laparoscope is introduced through the umbilical trocar. Once the abdomen has been inspected, three additional trocars are typically placed under direct vision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50974\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50974 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F65844\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65844 \">figure 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The assistant's 5 mm trocar is usually placed at the mid-axillary line halfway between the costal margin and the anterior superior iliac spine. A grasping forceps is placed to grasp the fundus of the gallbladder and retract it and the liver superiorly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second 5 or 10 mm port, which will accommodate the surgeon's right hand instruments, is placed in the high <span class=\"nowrap\">epigastric/subxiphoid</span> region just to the right of the falciform ligament. The size of the trocar depends on the size of the clip applier to be used. This trocar is directed toward the gallbladder neck.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A history of prior abdominal surgery may affect port placement. As an example, in patients who have had a prior coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) utilizing the right gastroepiploic artery, the epigastric port must be placed under direct vision to the right of the falciform ligament, as the right gastroepiploic-coronary graft generally runs to the left of the falciform ligament [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Thus, preoperative detailed knowledge of the patient&rsquo;s past surgical history (eg, CABG) is essential to preventing iatrogenic injuries to the graft.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third trocar for the surgeon's left hand instruments is placed at the right midclavicular line just below the liver edge.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Gallbladder exposure and dissection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The assistant using the ratcheted toothed grasper pushes the fundus of the gallbladder superiorly and laterally to reveal the infundibulum and porta hepatis.</p><p>If the gallbladder is distended, it can be difficult to grasp. Aspirating it with a large bore needle or a sharp tipped suction device facilitates purchase by the grasper. The grasper (or stitch or ligating loop) can then be used to close the hole to prevent further spillage of content.</p><p>Occasionally, adhesions to the duodenum, omentum, or colon from previous surgery or inflammation impair this exposure. The surgeon can take down these adhesions safely by grasping the adhesions at their attachment high on the gallbladder and stripping them down bluntly towards the infundibulum. Minimal electrocautery should be used in order to reduce the risk of thermal injury to the adjacent bowel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52727\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52727 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Dissection of the hepatocystic triangle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important consideration in a cholecystectomy is the clear identification of the cystic artery and duct prior to division.</p><p>To this end, a thorough dissection of the hepatocystic triangle, bounded by the gallbladder wall, cystic duct, and common hepatic duct, to obtain the &quot;critical view of safety&quot; is a key step (discussed below) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66207\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66207 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The surgeon grasps the infundibulum with the left hand forceps and retracts inferiorly and laterally to open the angle between the cystic duct and common duct. This instrument is used to provide retraction in various angles to give anterior and posterior exposure of the triangle.</p><p>Occasionally, a large stone at the gallbladder neck prevents grasping of the infundibulum. This scenario can be managed by dislodging and &quot;milking&quot; the stone back up into the gallbladder body or by placing a stitch into the infundibulum and using that for retraction. The dissection of the junction of the gallbladder and cystic duct begins by the surgeon gently stripping the peritoneum starting high on the gallbladder. Keeping the dissection on a known safe structure (the gallbladder) to develop visualization of the unknown structures is an important principle.</p><p>The postero-lateral aspect of the gallbladder is the safest area for initial dissection and can be exposed by retracting the infundibulum superior and medial. The surgeon can use minimal cautery or blunt dissection to incise the superficial layer of peritoneum attaching the gallbladder neck to the liver in order to allow further retraction of the infundibulum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Critical view of safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anterior and posterior dissection continues with alternating infero-lateral and supero-medial retraction of the neck until the gallbladder is dissected away from the liver, creating a &quot;window&quot; crossed by two structures: the cystic duct and artery. This is the &quot;critical view of safety&quot; that should be achieved prior to clipping or dividing any tubular structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66207\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66207 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is no need to dissect down to the cystic duct-common bile duct junction unless the cystic duct is very short. The cystic artery should be dissected in a similar fashion. Calot's node, or cystic duct lymph node, is usually encountered adjacent and anterior to the artery and can be a useful landmark. Electrocautery may be needed for hemostasis before the node can be bluntly swept down (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52727\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52727 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The surgeon should be aware of certain anatomic variations in order to avoid misidentification of structures. A common anomaly is the right hepatic artery looping onto the infundibulum and being mistaken for the cystic artery. A short cystic duct is also seen quite frequently and could drain into the right hepatic duct, the common duct, or a low-lying aberrant right sectoral duct. In the presence of severe, acute, or chronic inflammation, or with a large stone in the neck of the gallbladder, the infundibulum may be &quot;tethered&quot; to the hepatic duct, which may lead the surgeon to misidentify the common bile duct for the cystic duct.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Division of cystic artery and cystic duct</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the cystic duct and artery are fully dissected, a clip is placed laterally on the cystic duct adjacent the gallbladder. The cystic duct is incised distal to the clip and the side of a closed grasper used to sweep the bile duct towards the ductotomy to assess cystic duct patency. Then, using a curved dissector, the cystic duct is &quot;milked&quot; retrograde by compressing it towards the ductotomy to identify any stones, bring out any small residual stones, and to assess for free flow of bile. Once this is accomplished, two more clips are placed distal to the ductotomy.</p><p>Both jaws of the clip should be seen to clearly encompass the duct to avoid inadvertent injuries to structures behind the clips and to ensure complete duct closure. The duct can then be transected with scissors. Alternatives to clipping the cystic duct include tying the duct closed (eg, Endoloop), and the use of advanced tissue sealing devices (eg, Enseal). Monopolar electrocautery should not be used since the electrical current can be transmitted to the clips and cause delayed necrosis of the stump. </p><p>The artery is clipped and divided in a similar fashion. The anterior branch of the cystic artery is commonly mistaken for the main cystic artery; therefore, the tissue behind the clipped artery should be dissected to ensure that there is no posterior branch, which can cause troublesome bleeding during the subsequent removal of the gallbladder. The clipped stumps should be inspected for adequacy of closure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation for choledocholithiasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If there is any concern for choledocholithiasis (elevated bilirubin, dilated duct) or uncertain anatomy, the common bile duct should be imaged intraoperatively. This should occur after the first clip is placed on the cystic duct. Intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC) or laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) may be performed. Once stones are found and retrieved, a completion cholangiogram should be obtained to verify clearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F59179\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59179 \">image 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraoperative cholangiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) should be accomplished before beginning common bile duct (CBD) exploration. The catheter for IOC is placed after careful dissection achieves the critical view of safety (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66207\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66207 \">figure 4</a>). The technique of IOC and common bile duct exploration are discussed elsewhere in detail.

It requires a certain comfort and skill level. A prospective multicenter study of 209 patients showed that in experienced hands, LUS can be equivalent to an IOC in detecting stones and can be performed almost 50 percent faster [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. On the other hand, IOC is better at detecting intrahepatic anatomy and anatomic anomalies of the biliary tree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. A retrospective study of 1381 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy at five centers showed that LUS successfully delineated the bile duct anatomy in 98 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Dissection of gallbladder from liver bed</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The assistant places continual cephalad traction on the gallbladder fundus while the surgeon alternates medial and lateral anteroposterior traction on the infundibulum with the left hand grasper. This retraction exposes and maintains tension on the plane of tissue attaching the gallbladder to the liver. This tissue is gently divided using a hook or spatula cautery in a sweeping motion. This dissection continues from infundibulum to fundus, and bleeding should be minimal if dissection is performed in the correct plane. Prior to completely detaching the gallbladder, the liver should be inspected for areas of bleeding or bile leakage. The right upper quadrant is irrigated, and then the gallbladder is fully released.</p><p>The routine placement of drains is not necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], but, occasionally, persistent minimal bile leakage occurs from the liver bed. This leak may be from a transected duct of Luschka or, more likely, from a superficial duct within the liver that was unroofed during the dissection. If the end of the duct can be grasped, then the duct should be clipped. Otherwise, one may perform intracorporeal suturing of the opening of the duct, but if unsuccessful, leave a closed suction drain to control the leak. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Gallbladder extraction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The umbilical incision is the ideal location for extracting the gallbladder. The umbilical incision has no muscle layers and is easy to extend with minimal pain and cosmetic sequelae. To limit bile contamination of the abdomen and wound, an extraction bag is used when the gallbladder is acutely inflamed and friable or when there was inadvertent perforation of the gallbladder. Any remaining loose stones can be placed in the bag as well. The laparoscope is transferred to the subxiphoid position, and the bag or a large toothed grasper is positioned within the umbilical trocar.</p><p>The gallbladder is placed into the bag or the infundibulum is grasped with the forceps. The trocar is removed, and the gallbladder is withdrawn through this incision under laparoscopic vision. If the gallbladder is very large or contains large stones, the fascial incision may need to be stretched or enlarged. Once the gallbladder is removed, the right upper quadrant can be irrigated if necessary, and the other trocars can be removed under direct vision while allowing escape of CO2. The umbilical fascia is then closed with the stay sutures originally placed. </p><p>The specimen can also be retrieved through the subxiphoid port site. Some surgeons feel that the subxiphoid site may be better for specimen extraction as the subxiphoid site has a lower likelihood of hernia formation; however, formal study of this has not been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>The skin is closed with subcuticular absorbable stitches and with adhesive strips. The access site incisions can be infused with local anesthetic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>), which reduces postoperative pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

These instruments are either placed directly through the abdominal wall without a trocar, or through special low-friction trocars of small diameters (2 to 4 mm). Although mini-laparoscopic cholecystectomy requires the same four incisions as standard cholecystectomy, three of the incisions are smaller and therefore less invasive to the patient. The remaining umbilical incision has a standard size of 5 to 10 mm, which permits the use of a standard laparoscope and specimen extraction. About 10 percent of attempted mini-laparoscopic cholecystectomies require conversion, most often to standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy rather than open surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>In a metaanalysis of 12 randomized trials including 712 patients, mini-laparoscopic cholecystectomy resulted in less postoperative pain and better cosmesis than standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

Through a single skin incision typically made periumbilically, multiple trocars are placed through one or more fascial punctures.

Overall, SIS offers little benefit over standard laparoscopic surgery, as illustrated by the following studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/46-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-63</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Operative time &ndash; SIS cholecystectomy takes a slightly longer time to perform than standard LC.

Compared with conventional surgery, NOTES offers true scarless abdominal surgery, which has the potential of minimizing postoperative patient discomfort. However, as an emerging technology, NOTES still faces many technical challenges.

They are at higher risk for any surgical procedure, and preoperative preparation is critical for good outcomes. These patients should have their liver function optimized prior to an elective cholecystectomy. Some may need replacement of clotting factors to minimize intraoperative bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessing-surgical-risk-in-patients-with-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessing surgical risk in patients with liver disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Care should be taken when placing trocars to avoid the &quot;caput medusa&quot; of large collateral vessels in the abdominal wall. The cirrhotic liver itself is usually quite hard and easily injured just with retraction. Bleeding from a cirrhotic liver is difficult to control, so remaining in the correct plane during dissection of the gallbladder from the liver is particularly important.</p><p>Various hemostatic agents and energy sources (the argon cautery device can be quite useful) need to be available in case bleeding develops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Particular care should be taken in making water-tight closures for all incisions to minimize perioperative ascitic leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a strong association between pregnancy and gallstones. In the past, elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones was deferred as much as possible until after pregnancy. For patients with severe biliary colic, however, waiting until after pregnancy can lead to repeated hospitalizations and complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Laparoscopic gallbladder surgery has been performed safely during pregnancy by experienced surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. In the guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and use of laparoscopy for surgical problems during pregnancy (2007), the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) organization stated that laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed safely during any trimester of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. We concur with that statement. </p><p>When laparoscopic surgery is performed in pregnant patients, the trocars need to be placed higher in the abdomen due to the enlarged uterus. The CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation should be kept at the lowest possible pressure while maintaining an adequate working space. If CBD imaging is necessary, laparoscopic ultrasound should be used in place of intraoperative cholangiogram to limit radiation exposure. Preoperative obstetric consultation and perioperative fetal monitoring are advisable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Details of proper positioning for surgery and management of pregnant women undergoing surgery are discussed elsewhere.

The thickness of the wall inhibits the mobility of the trocars so they should be placed at the angle most likely to be used during the cholecystectomy. Longer trocars may be needed to traverse the abdominal wall in order to avoid trocar displacement and subsequent insufflation within the abdominal wall and subcutaneous emphysema. Longer instruments may be required to reach the gallbladder, and the initial umbilical trocar may need to be placed at a supraumbilical position. The surgeon should not hesitate to place additional trocars if needed. Although laparoscopy may be more challenging in the morbidly obese patient, it may offer advantages specific to these patients such as decreased wound infection, DVT, and incisional hernias, which may make laparoscopy the preferred approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Gangrenous cholecystitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be done safely in the setting of acute or gangrenous cholecystitis and should be done as soon as possible to fall within the &quot;golden period&quot; within 72 hours when edema is the primary manifestation of the inflammation. If the patient presents in a delayed fashion (&gt;72 hours from onset of symptoms), the surgery can be performed if there are no contraindications to an open procedure, as conversion is a significant risk. In the face of acute cholecystitis with multiple co-morbidities, it may be preferable to treat with IV antibiotics and possibly percutaneous drainage, with subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy six to eight weeks later. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-calculous-cholecystitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute calculous cholecystitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Different techniques may be needed when a gangrenous gallbladder or dense inflammation is encountered. A &quot;top down&quot; approach to dissection of the gallbladder as in an open procedure may be necessary to appreciate the anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>]. The surgeon may perform subtotal cholecystectomy by transecting the infundibulum as close to the cystic duct as possible and extracting all stones. The gallbladder neck is then sewn closed, if possible, and a drain is placed in the gallbladder bed. This transection of an edematous, friable wall may be facilitated by using the ultrasonic shears. In a gallbladder densely adherent to the liver where the plane between the two is obliterated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in the presence of portal hypertension, it may be preferable to leave the back wall of the gallbladder intact and fully cauterize its mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Blunt dissection with a suction irrigator or laparoscopic peanut is particularly useful in defining anatomy around a grossly inflamed duct.</p><p>An active suction drain should be left beneath the liver if there is any question regarding the integrity of the cystic duct closure or any suspicion of bile leakage from the gallbladder bed. We do not place a drain to monitor for bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Large cystic duct</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally the cystic duct is quite enlarged and inflamed and standard clips are inadequate to seal the duct. In these instances, preformed suture loops may be helpful in completely closing the duct. Some surgeons may suture ligate the cystic duct stump using intracorporeal suturing, while others use extracorporeal knot tying in order to control the duct before transecting it. Rarely, an endoscopic stapler is used to transect an unusually large cystic duct after assuring that the structure is not, in fact, the common bile duct.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRAOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Major complications, including vascular injury, bowel perforation, mesenteric injury, and bile duct injuries, often require immediate laparotomy.

Patients follow up in clinic two to four weeks after their operation.</p><p>Most patients have some abdominal pain that resolves within two to three days after surgery and can be managed with analgesics. Occasionally, patients have referred shoulder and neck pain from the CO2 insufflation causing diaphragmatic irritation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serious complications that occur with laparoscopic cholecystectomy, including bile duct injury, bile leaks, bleeding, and bowel injury result in part from patient selection, surgical inexperience, and the technical constraints that are inherent to the minimally invasive approach. These are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-laparoscopic-cholecystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other adverse outcomes, such as retained common bile duct stones (incidence of around 10 percent), postcholecystectomy syndromes, and misdiagnoses (sphincter of Oddi dysfunction) occur with the same frequency with both laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choledocholithiasis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choledocholithiasis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H689178094\"><span class=\"h2\">Postcholecystectomy syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postcholecystectomy syndrome (PCS) is a complex of heterogeneous symptoms, including persistent abdominal pain and dyspepsia, that recur and persist after cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,94</a>]. In a prospective cohort study, only 60 percent of patients reported complete relief of abdominal pain at 12 weeks after cholecystectomy for uncomplicated symptomatic cholelithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. </p><p>PCS is defined as &quot;early&quot; if it occurs in the postoperative period and &quot;late&quot; if it occurs months or years after surgery. The symptoms of pain and dyspepsia referred to as PCS can be caused by a wide spectrum of conditions, both biliary and extrabiliary. About half of the patients with PCS are found to have biliary, pancreatic, or gastrointestinal disorders, while the remaining patients have extraintestinal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-cholecystectomy/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biliary causes of PCS include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Early PCS can be due to biliary injury, retained cystic duct, or common bile duct stones.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Late PCS can be due to recurrent CBD stones, bile duct strictures, an inflamed cystic duct or gallbladder remnant, papillary stenosis, or biliary dyskinesia. Biliary dyskinesia refers to motor forms of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction can be evaluated with sphincter of Oddi manometry, which is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-sphincter-of-oddi-dysfunction#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extrabiliary causes of PCS include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gastrointestinal causes such as irritable bowel syndrome, pancreatitis, pancreatic tumors, pancreas divisum, hepatitis, peptic ulcer disease, mesenteric ischemia, diverticulitis, or esophageal diseases</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extraintestinal causes such as intercostal neuritis, wound neuroma, coronary artery disease, or psychosomatic disorders</p><p/><p>Treatment for PCS is tailored to the specific cause of the symptoms. Diagnosis of the underlying problem causing PCS usually requires imaging to look for retained or recurrent stones or identify a bile duct leak, stricture, or transection. This can be accomplished in most cases with ultrasound <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> computed tomography (CT) scanning followed by direct cholangiography or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). MRCP provides a noninvasive alternative to direct cholangiography for evaluation of the biliary tract. The approach to the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis or biliary injury is discussed elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative discussion with the patient should include the possibility of conversion to an open procedure. The patients should be informed about the risks of bile duct injury, bowel injury, vascular injury, and re-operation or need for postoperative ERCP. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important consideration in a cholecystectomy is the clear identification of the cystic artery and duct prior to division. The &quot;critical view of safety&quot; should be achieved prior to clipping or dividing any tubular structures. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Standard procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A laparoscopic operation should be converted to an open procedure if the surgeon encounters a situation demanding manual palpation and direct vision for correction. Surgeons should convert to open operations without hesitation if the need arises. (See <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternative minimally invasive techniques of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (eg, mini-laparoscopy, single-incision surgery) can be used (where available) for select patients who desire minimal pain and optimal cosmesis.
