This reaction, called &quot;vasoconstriction,&quot; decreases blood flow to the skin, which helps to minimize heat loss from the warm blood and therefore preserve a normal internal or &quot;core&quot; temperature. In warm temperatures, these same blood vessels dilate or widen, increasing the flow of blood to the skin surface and thus allowing heat to leave the body. The blood vessels in the skin that react to temperature changes are called thermoregulatory vessels. These specialized blood vessels are primarily controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, the same system that reacts when we are stressed or upset emotionally. This explains why both cold and emotional stress can trigger vasoconstriction of these blood vessels, causing cold fingers and toes. Thus, cold hands and feet occur normally in everybody when we are exposed to cold temperatures or emotional stress.</p><p>In people with RP, the mechanisms that control vasoconstriction are thought to be altered or defective. The vessels constrict in an exaggerated way in response to cold and emotional or physical stress, causing what is called Raynaud's phenomenon or a Raynaud's attack. There are three phases of the event represented by skin color changes. First, severe vasoconstriction reduces blood flow to the skin of the affected areas, causing the skin surface to feel cold to touch and to have a white color. The pale white color is due to virtually no blood flow to the skin. The skin then typically becomes a purplish-blue color (called acrocyanosis), as a reduced flow of blood through the skin returns. When the vessel fully recovers, it dilates, allowing blood flow to resume; the skin may blush, becoming very pink or red.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RAYNAUD PHENOMENON RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is estimated that Raynaud phenomenon (RP) affects 3 to 5 percent of the general population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who have RP without a related disease are said to have primary RP. The underlying reason for blood vessel sensitivity to cold is uncertain. Primary RP may be a family trait, suggesting that one or more genes that regulate skin blood flow may be responsible.</p><p>Primary RP accounts for the majority of cases and is more common among women, younger age groups (ie, people under 30), and family members of people with RP. Fortunately, most people with primary RP are not significantly disabled by the condition and respond well to treatment. It often improves with time, and people learn to avoid or prepare for cold and emotional triggers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with an underlying disease or defined cause of RP are classified as having secondary RP. There are several known causes of secondary RP. A common cause of secondary RP is the autoimmune rheumatic diseases, such as scleroderma or systemic lupus erythematosus. These diseases cause a secondary injury that alters the blood vessels and, as a consequence, the injury affects how they react to stimuli such as cold and stress. Secondary RP can be more difficult to manage than primary RP because it is linked to an underlying condition that can physically damage the blood vessel. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">RAYNAUD PHENOMENON CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal control of blood vessel responses to cold and other stimuli is complex, involving the central nervous system, peripheral sensory nerves, and molecules released by circulating cells or from the inner lining of the blood vessel itself (called the endothelium). Raynaud phenomenon (RP) occurs when this complex and delicate system of control is disrupted, which alters the normal responses to the environment.</p><p>A Raynaud attack can be triggered by exposure to cold temperature or even by a shift in temperature from warm to cool. As a result, even mildly cold exposures, such as those caused by air conditioning or the cold of the refrigerated food section in a grocery store, can cause an attack. Experiencing a general body chill can also trigger an attack, even if the hands and feet are kept warm. Feeling emotional stress and being startled can cause an attack of RP due to the release of nerve transmitter substances; these substances activate certain proteins in the blood vessels, which signal the vessels to narrow (constrict).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RAYNAUD PHENOMENON SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most often, a Raynaud attack affects the blood vessels in the fingers. In a typical attack, the fingers (or toes) become suddenly cold as the blood vessels constrict. The skin color changes markedly and may become pale (called a &quot;white attack&quot;) or a purple or blue color (called a &quot;blue attack&quot;). Usually, an attack of RP begins in a single finger and then spreads to other fingers in both hands. The index, middle, and ring fingers are most commonly involved, while the thumb is often not affected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F117079\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef117079 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>An attack can cause discomfort, including a &quot;pins and needles&quot; feeling, aching, numbness, or clumsiness of the affected hand(s). The feeling of true pain occurs more often in secondary RP and is caused by a prolonged loss of blood flow to the tissues.</p><p>Blood vessels supplying the skin of the ears, nose, face, knees, and nipples can also be affected, and the skin in these areas may become pale or bluish in color after cold exposure. Mottling (a bluish discoloration) of the skin of the arms and legs might also appear. Attacks affecting the toes are also common, although people tend to complain of these less frequently.</p><p>Symptoms of RP resolve as the provoking factor (cold or stress) is removed. After leaving the cold area and rewarming, the discoloration resolves after 15 to 20 minutes, and, as normal blood flow resumes, the skin &quot;blushes&quot; or becomes pink.</p><p>People with severe secondary Raynaud phenomenon (RP) can sometimes experience a serious decrease in blood flow that does not resolve even after the provoking factor or cold is removed. Pain and ulceration of the skin (usually on the tips of the fingers and toes) can result. In severe cases, deeper tissue injury can occur that can lead to loss of the tips of the fingers in some people with a secondary vascular disease causing RP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">RAYNAUD PHENOMENON DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Raynaud phenomenon (RP) is diagnosed based on the person's description of a typical attack following cold exposure. By asking questions, a health care provider can usually tell whether RP or another more common condition is causing cold hands or feet. It is most important to have a full evaluation by a health care provider to determine if RP is happening and the underlying cause of the RP. This requires a good history and physical examination and laboratory testing that may include blood tests and, on occasion, special studies of the blood vessels and their function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">RAYNAUD PHENOMENON TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By taking some simple steps, you can reduce the frequency of Raynaud attacks. Medicine might also be used to help control the symptoms.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid sudden cold exposure &ndash; Use strategies to keep the whole body warm and avoid rapidly shifting temperature, cold breezes, and damp cold conditions. These include dressing warmly, wearing layer clothing such as thermal underwear, donning a hat, and using mittens or gloves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help end an attack &ndash; Methods include placing the hands under warm water or in a warm place (such as in the armpits) or rotating the arms in a whirling windmill pattern.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid smoking &ndash; Nicotine and other chemicals in cigarettes cause the blood vessels to constrict and can aggravate Raynaud phenomenon (RP). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid medications that cause vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels) &ndash; Such medications include decongestants containing phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine, other amphetamines, diet pills, some migraine remedies containing ergotamine, herbs containing ephedra, and medications used to treat attention deficit disorder (ADD) such as methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine-amphetamine, and atomoxetine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce stress &ndash; Reduce stress and use relaxation techniques to reduce anxiety.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Medicine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the measures above are not sufficient, your doctor or nurse might recommend a medicine. Medicines called calcium channel blockers are the most commonly used. They are taken daily and can reduce both the frequency and the severity of Raynaud attacks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary Raynaud phenomenon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More aggressive treatment is sometimes needed for people with secondary RP. Most people need a medicine to reduce the frequency of attacks and prevent injury to the skin on the fingers and toes.</p><p>Several medicines have been studied for people who do not respond to calcium channel blockers. These include nitrates (topical nitroglycerin), blood pressure medications (angiotensin receptor inhibitors like losartan), phosphodiesterase inhibitors (sildenafil, pentoxifylline, or cilostazol), antidepressant medication (fluoxetine), or prostaglandins (prostacyclin). Botulinum toxin (brand name: Botox) locally injected at the base of the fingers can also be used, but the use of botulinum toxin for RP needs more study.</p><p>Hospitalization may be required if an attack of RP does not resolve and if blood flow to a finger or toe is seriously restricted. Treatment in this situation requires additional medications to dilate the blood vessels, improve blood flow, and prevent tissue injury or ulcerations. In some cases, surgery may be used to cut certain nerves at the base of the finger that trigger vasoconstriction in the affected area.</p><p>In rare instances, treatment may be ineffective in reversing the vasoconstriction. This can lead to ulceration (breaking down) of the skin. If all other treatments have failed and if deep tissue injury has occurred due to lack of blood flow, surgical amputation of the affected finger or toe may be necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=3438\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
