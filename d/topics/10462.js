There are an estimated 8 million alcohol dependent people in the United States alone, and approximately 500,000 episodes of withdrawal severe enough to require pharmacologic treatment occur each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The in-patient management of syndromes associated with moderate and severe alcohol withdrawal is reviewed here. The ambulatory management of mild alcohol withdrawal, the initial diagnosis and treatment of alcohol dependence, and specific conditions due to alcohol-related organ damage (eg, cirrhosis, pancreatitis) are discussed elsewhere.

Experiments in 1955 demonstrated that alcohol-naive volunteers given continual alcohol for longer periods developed more severe withdrawal than those who drank for shorter periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These results imply that most people are vulnerable to the effects of the abrupt cessation of prolonged, sustained ethanol intake. However, withdrawal usually does not occur in the general population because most people drink in an episodic fashion that does not lead to the sustained high blood concentrations of alcohol necessary to develop tolerance and withdrawal.</p><p>Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal occur because alcohol is a central nervous system depressant. Alcohol simultaneously enhances inhibitory tone (via modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid activity) and inhibits excitatory tone (via modulation of excitatory amino acid activity). Only the constant presence of ethanol preserves homeostasis. Abrupt cessation unmasks the adaptive responses to chronic ethanol use resulting in overactivity of the central nervous system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Gamma-aminobutyric acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Highly specific binding sites for ethanol are found on the GABA receptor complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Chronic ethanol use induces an insensitivity to GABA such that more inhibitor is required to maintain a constant inhibitory tone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As alcohol tolerance develops, the individual retains arousal at alcohol concentrations which would normally produce lethargy or even coma in relatively alcohol na&iuml;ve individuals. Cessation of alcohol or a reduction from chronically elevated concentrations results in decreased inhibitory tone. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Excitatory amino acids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glutamate is one of the major excitatory amino acids. When glutamate binds to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, calcium influx leads to neuronal excitation by binding to the glycine receptor on the NMDA complex. Ethanol inhibits glutamate induced excitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Adaption occurs by increasing the number of glutamate receptors in an attempt to maintain a normal state of arousal. Cessation of alcohol or a reduction from chronically elevated concentrations results in unregulated excess excitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2075545196\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS OF ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Minor withdrawal symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minor withdrawal symptoms are due to central nervous system hyperactivity, and can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insomnia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tremulousness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild anxiety</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal upset; anorexia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diaphoresis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpitations</p><p/><p>Symptoms are usually present within six hours of the cessation of drinking and often develop while patients still have a significant blood alcohol concentration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75499\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75499 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. If withdrawal does not progress, these findings resolve within 24 to 48 hours. The specific minor withdrawal symptoms in a given patient typically are consistent from one episode to the next. The ambulatory management of mild alcohol withdrawal, including criteria to determine which patients are suitable for out-patient management, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-management-of-alcohol-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory management of alcohol withdrawal&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Withdrawal seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Withdrawal-associated seizures are generalized tonic-clonic convulsions that usually occur within 12 to 48 hours after the last alcoholic drink, but may occur after only two hours of abstinence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75499\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75499 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The seizures occur predominantly in patients with a long history of chronic alcoholism, as evidenced by their typical onset during the fourth and fifth decades of life.</p><p>Withdrawal seizures are usually singular or occur as a brief flurry of seizures over a short period. Recurrent or prolonged seizures or status epilepticus are not consistent with withdrawal-associated seizures and should prompt an investigation into possible structural or infectious etiologies, generally guided by the findings of cranial computed tomography (CT) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lumbar puncture. Benzodiazepines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> can be used to treat status epilepticus while investigations proceed. Several studies have demonstrated that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> is ineffective in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal seizures and the drug should not be used for this purpose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>While some authors use other anticonvulsants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a> in the therapy of alcohol withdrawal, the role of these medications in alcohol withdrawal related seizures is incompletely evaluated.</p><p>Although seemingly benign, alcohol withdrawal seizures left untreated progress to delirium tremens in nearly one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Delirium tremens (DT)'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Alcoholic hallucinosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite a tendency to equate alcoholic hallucinosis with delirium tremens, the two terms are NOT synonymous. Alcoholic hallucinosis refers to hallucinations that develop within 12 to 24 hours of abstinence and typically resolve within 24 to 48 hours (which is the earliest point at which delirium tremens typically develops) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75499\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75499 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Hallucinations are usually visual, although auditory and tactile phenomena may also occur. Patients are aware that they are hallucinating and often very distressed. However, in contrast to delirium tremens, alcoholic hallucinosis is not associated with global clouding of the sensorium but only with specific hallucinations, and vital signs are usually normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with visual hallucinations&quot;, section on 'Alcohol and drug use or withdrawal'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Delirium tremens (DT)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical manifestations of severe withdrawal and DT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 5 percent of patients who undergo withdrawal from alcohol suffer from DT. DT is defined by hallucinations, disorientation, tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, agitation, and diaphoresis in the setting of acute reduction or abstinence from alcohol. DT typically begins between 48 and 96 hours after the last drink and lasts one to five days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75499\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75499 \">table 1</a>). DT and alcoholic hallucinosis are NOT synonymous and symptoms that occur a few hours after the cessation of drinking, even if severe, are usually not manifestations of DT. Virtually all patients who develop DT experience symptoms of alcohol withdrawal prior to the onset of DT. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Alcoholic hallucinosis'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients with DT have significantly elevated cardiac indices, oxygen delivery, and oxygen consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Arterial pH rises due to hyperventilation, which may be a rebound effect related to the respiratory depressant properties of alcohol. Hyperventilation and consequent respiratory alkalosis in this setting result in a significant decrease in cerebral blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. There is a correlation between the length of the preceding alcohol binge, the degree of clouding of the sensorium, and the size of the average decrease in cerebral hemispheric blood flow, although there is no association between blood flow parameters and hallucinations or tremors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Severe alcohol withdrawal is often associated with fluid and electrolyte status abnormalities. Almost all patients in acute withdrawal are hypovolemic as a result of diaphoresis, hyperthermia, vomiting, tachypnea, and decreased oral intake. Hypokalemia is common due to renal and extrarenal potassium losses, alterations in aldosterone levels, and changes in potassium distribution across the cell membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Hypomagnesemia is common in patients with DT and may predispose to dysrhythmias and seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Hypophosphatemia may occur due to malnutrition, may be symptomatic, and if severe, may contribute to cardiac failure and rhabdomyolysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for the development of DT include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of sustained drinking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of previous DT</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age greater than 30</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of a concurrent illness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of significant alcohol withdrawal in the presence of an elevated alcohol level</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A longer period since the last drink (ie, patients who present with alcohol withdrawal more than two days after their last drink are more likely to experience DT than those who present within two days)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With early identification and current management strategies, mortality from DT is less than five percent. This figure has diminished from the 37 percent mortality rate reported in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, probably as a result of earlier diagnosis, improvements in supportive and pharmacologic therapies, and improved treatment of comorbid illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/2,22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,22-26</a>]. Death usually is due to arrhythmia, complicating illnesses, such as pneumonia, or failure to identify an underlying problem that led to the cessation of alcohol use, such as pancreatitis, hepatitis, or central nervous system injury or infection. Older age, preexisting cardio-pulmonary disease, core body temperature greater than 40&ordm;C (104&ordm;F), and coexisting liver disease are associated with a greater risk of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Ruling out alternative diagnoses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alcohol withdrawal remains a clinical diagnosis. It may be necessary to perform extensive testing, including lumbar puncture and cranial CT, to rule out other diagnostic considerations with confidence. This is particularly true when the presentation includes altered mental status and fever. Conditions, such as infection (eg, meningitis), trauma (eg, intracranial hemorrhage), metabolic derangements, drug overdose, hepatic failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding, can mimic or coexist with alcohol withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A premature diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal can lead to inappropriate use of sedatives, which can further delay accurate diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptom control and supportive care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once comorbid illnesses have been excluded or adequately treated, the management of alcohol withdrawal is directed at alleviating symptoms and identifying and correcting metabolic derangements. Benzodiazepines are used to control psychomotor agitation and prevent progression to more severe withdrawal. Supportive care, including intravenous fluids, nutritional supplementation, and frequent clinical reassessment including vital signs, is important. Clinicians must avoid complacency when treating patients with alcohol withdrawal. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of psychomotor agitation with benzodiazepines'</a> below and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Symptom-triggered therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients should be placed in a quiet, protective environment. Mechanical restraint may be necessary temporarily for patients suffering from delirium tremens (DT) in order to protect both the patient and caretakers. Clinicians should follow their facility's guidelines for documentation and implementation of physical restraints. Once adequate chemical sedation is achieved, physical restraints should be removed, as resistance against restraints can increase temperature, produce rhabdomyolysis, and cause physical injury.</p><p>Volume deficits can be calculated and replaced accordingly, or, if there are no contraindications, isotonic intravenous fluid can be infused rapidly until patients are clinically euvolemic. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Thiamine</a> and glucose should be administered in order to prevent or treat Wernicke's encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Multivitamins containing or supplemented with folate should be given routinely, and deficiencies of glucose, potassium, magnesium, and phosphate should be corrected as needed. Initially (first day or two), treatment should be intravenous as gastrointestinal absorption is impaired in many patients who abuse alcohol chronically. The details of these supportive treatments are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wernicke-encephalopathy#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wernicke encephalopathy&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-chronic-neurologic-complications-of-alcohol\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the chronic neurologic complications of alcohol&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of hypokalemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-hypophosphatemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of hypophosphatemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some clinicians treat alcohol withdrawal patients with an intravenous infusion of a combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a>, folate, and a multivitamin in isotonic saline with 5 percent dextrose. The multivitamin makes the fluid appear yellow, and thus, this treatment combination is sometimes referred to as a &ldquo;banana bag&rdquo;. Use of this treatment has not been well studied, and it may not meet the specific requirements for fluid, glucose, and other substrates of many patients with alcohol withdrawal.</p><p>During the early phases of withdrawal alcoholic patients are often given nothing by mouth (ie, NPO) to prevent aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, nutritional support is essential as alcoholic patients are frequently malnourished and have high metabolic needs due to their excited autonomic state. Initially, parenteral glucose supplementation is sufficient, but additional nutrition may be needed for patients who remain unable to eat for more than a day or two. Patients considered at high risk for complications should be monitored in an intensive care unit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73377\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73377 \">table 2</a>).

In general, long-acting benzodiazepines with active metabolites (eg, diazepam or chlordiazepoxide) are preferred because they seem to result in a smoother course with less chance of recurrent withdrawal or seizures. We recommend a symptom-triggered approach to treatment with benzodiazepines. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Symptom-triggered therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>We prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> (Ativan) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxazepam</a> (Serax) for the treatment of patients with advanced cirrhosis or acute alcoholic hepatitis. The shorter half-life of lorazepam and the absence of active metabolites with oxazepam may prevent prolonged effects if oversedation occurs. In contrast, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlordiazepoxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlordiazepoxide</a> has a relatively long half-life and may lead to oversedation in patients with severe liver disease. Treatment with agents available in parenteral form (eg, lorazepam, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a>) may be necessary in patients who cannot receive oral medications.</p><p>Given the recent trend of drug shortages, preferred agents may not always be available. A treatment algorithm for clinicians managing moderate or severe alcohol withdrawal without access to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53322\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef53322 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>Benzodiazepines exert their effect via stimulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, causing a decrease in neuronal activity and relative sedation. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Gamma-aminobutyric acid'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Route</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with seizures or DT require intravenous (IV) therapy with benzodiazepines. IV therapy is appropriate for the initial management of most patients with tremulousness from alcohol withdrawal because of guaranteed absorption and rapidity of onset. It is important to have IV access in all patients at risk of severe withdrawal.</p><p>Intramuscular administration should be avoided because of variable drug absorption. Oral formulations are preferred in most outpatient settings, for the prevention of withdrawal in asymptomatic patients known to be at risk, and for those with mild and minimal symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Prophylaxis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-management-of-alcohol-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory management of alcohol withdrawal&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Following IV administration, patients should be converted to oral dosing as soon as possible based on their clinical response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Titration of medications should be based upon a given patient's risk factors for and ability to tolerate DT. As an example, a patient younger than 45 years with no comorbid illnesses should be lightly sedated to a degree that insures safety and comfort but does not obscure the neurologic examination. In contrast, an older patient with preexisting cardiopulmonary disease may benefit from heavier sedation, but must be closely monitored due to the greater risk imposed by the high systemic stress of major withdrawal or oversedation. Explicit criteria for ICU admission are provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73377\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73377 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>A variety of dosing schedules can be used. We generally give IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a>, 5 to 10 mg IV every 5 to 10 minutes, until the appropriate level of sedation is achieved. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lorazepam</a>, 2 to 4 mg IV every 15 to 20 minutes, can also be used. Equivalent doses of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlordiazepoxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlordiazepoxide</a> are on the order of 25 to 100 mg, which can be repeated hourly.

Evaluation intervals as frequent as every 10 to 15 minutes are appropriate for patients with more severe symptoms being treated with IV benzodiazepines. Once severe symptoms are controlled, hourly reassessment of such patients is reasonable. In contrast, an interval of four to six hours is reasonable for stable patients with mild symptoms receiving oral benzodiazepines.</p><p>When the score is elevated, additional medication is given. For acute withdrawal, we give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> 5 to 10 mg IV (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlordiazepoxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlordiazepoxide</a> 25 to 100 mg orally) for any score of 8 or greater on the CIWA-Ar.</p><p>In some patients with severe alcohol withdrawal, including those who require tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, assessment scales such as the CIWA-Ar that rely upon patients being able to answer specific questions cannot be used effectively. In these patients, we suggest using a sedation scale more appropriate for the intensive care setting such as the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57874\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57874 \">table 4</a>).

Benzodiazepines, which increase the frequency of GABA chloride channel opening, and barbiturates, which increase the duration of channel opening, may work synergistically. We give phenobarbital 130 to 260 mg IV, repeated every 15 to 20 minutes, until symptoms are controlled. While one recent study provides support for early use of phenobarbital, we feel that this study needs to be replicated before it can be adopted into mainstream practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-moderate-and-severe-alcohol-withdrawal-syndromes/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].
