The sinuses are hollow areas in the bones of the face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75045 \">figure 1</a>). They have a thin lining that normally makes a small amount of mucus. When this lining gets infected, it swells and makes extra mucus. This causes symptoms.</p><p>Sinusitis can occur when a person gets sick with a cold. The germs causing the cold can also infect the sinuses. Many times, a person feels like his or her cold is getting better. But then he or she gets sinusitis and begins to feel sick again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H566815700\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of sinusitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common symptoms of sinusitis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stuffy or blocked nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thick yellow or green discharge from the nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the teeth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain or pressure in the face &ndash; This often feels worse when a person bends forward.</p><p/><p>People with sinusitis can also have other symptoms that include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble smelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ear pressure or fullness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bad breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired</p><p/><p>Most of the time, symptoms start to improve in 7 to 10 days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H566815707\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if your symptoms last more than 10 days, or if your symptoms get better at first but then get worse.</p><p>Sometimes, sinusitis can lead to serious problems. See your doctor or nurse right away (do not wait 10 days) if you have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever higher than 102&deg;F (38.9&deg;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden and severe pain in the face and head</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble seeing or seeing double</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble thinking clearly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling or redness around one or both eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A stiff neck</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H566815714\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To reduce your symptoms, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take an over-the-counter pain reliever to reduce the pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rinse your nose and sinuses with salt water a few times a day &ndash; Ask your doctor or nurse about the best way to do this.</p><p/><p>Antihistamines do not improve symptoms of sinusitis. Common antihistamines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">diphenhydramine</a> (sample brand name: Benadryl), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpheniramine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">chlorpheniramine</a> (sample brand name: Chlor-Trimeton), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">loratadine</a> (sample brand name: Claritin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">cetirizine</a> (sample brand name: Zyrtec). They can treat allergies, but not sinus infections, and could increase your discomfort by drying the lining of your nose and sinuses, or making you tired.</p><p>Your doctor might also prescribe a steroid nose spray to reduce the swelling in your nose. (Steroid nose sprays do not contain the same steroids that some athletes take illegally.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H566815721\"><span class=\"h1\">How is sinusitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the time, sinusitis does not need to be treated with antibiotic medicines. This is because most sinusitis is caused by viruses &ndash; not bacteria &ndash; and antibiotics do not kill viruses. Many people get over sinus infections without antibiotics.</p><p>Some people with sinusitis do need treatment with antibiotics. If your symptoms have not improved after 10 days, ask your doctor if you should take antibiotics. Your doctor might recommend that you wait 1 more week to see if your symptoms improve. But if you have symptoms such as a fever or a lot of pain, he or she might prescribe antibiotics. It is important to follow your doctor's instructions about taking your antibiotics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H566815728\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my symptoms do not get better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your symptoms do not get better, talk with your doctor or nurse. He or she might order tests to figure out why you still have symptoms. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT scan or other imaging tests &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test to look inside the sinuses &ndash; For this test, a doctor puts a thin tube with a camera on the end into the nose and up into the sinuses.</p><p/><p>Some people get a lot of sinus infections or have symptoms that last at least 3 months. These people can have a different type of sinusitis called &quot;chronic sinusitis.&quot; Chronic sinusitis can be caused by different things. For example, some people have growths in their nose or sinuses that are called &quot;polyps.&quot; Other people have allergies that cause their symptoms.</p><p>Chronic sinusitis can be treated in different ways. If you have chronic sinusitis, talk with your doctor about which treatments are right for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H566815735\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rinsing-out-your-nose-with-salt-water-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rinsing out your nose with salt water (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-sinusitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic sinusitis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-sinusitis-sinus-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acute sinusitis (sinus infection) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-rhinosinusitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic rhinosinusitis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: The common cold in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
