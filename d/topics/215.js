These include a better understanding of the natural history of testicular tumors, improved staging and surgical techniques, the availability of serum tumor markers, and the use of effective platinum-based combination chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-following-orchiectomy-for-stage-i-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

However, the interpretation of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings is limited by the need to use size criteria (&gt;1 cm diameter in the short axis) rather than physiologic measures. Therefore, false-negative findings are frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-following-orchiectomy-for-stage-i-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The presence of occult micrometastases is evidenced by a retroperitoneal relapse rate of approximately 20 to 25 percent in men with clinical stage I nonseminomatous GCTs who did not undergo retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-following-orchiectomy-for-stage-i-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p>For men with early stage nonseminomatous GCTs, the only reliable method to identify small nodal involvement is RPLND. However, approximately 70 percent of men who undergo RPLND are pathologically node negative. Thus, the majority of men who undergo RPLND do not benefit from surgery. These observations have led to the use of active surveillance or adjuvant chemotherapy following orchiectomy.

Men undergoing surveillance must fully understand the risks of disease recurrence and should be willing to comply with the follow-up schedule. For men who will be followed without further treatment after inguinal orchiectomy, our approach is generally consistent with the surveillance recommendations from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-following-orchiectomy-for-stage-i-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Relapses more than 15 years after orchiectomy have been reported, although late relapses are rare. Because of the amount of radiation from computed tomography (CT) scans and chest radiographs in otherwise young patients, methods to reduce radiation, such as low-radiation dose protocols or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, are being evaluated.

Of these, 288 patients (14.4 percent) relapsed in the first two years, and 100 patients had a late (two to five years) or very late (greater than five years) relapse. The conditional risk of relapse for those disease free after two years was 5 percent, and the risk of relapse for those disease free after five years was 1 percent.

The conditional risk of relapse for those disease free after two years was 2.1 percent, and the risk of relapse for those disease free after five years was 1 percent. In those who relapsed, there were 15 patients (3.9 percent, 1.1 percent of the entire cohort) who died of progressive disease or treatment-related complications.</p><p/><p>Similar results were reported in a Canadian study of 1239 patients with clinical stage I testicular GCTs managed with active surveillance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/active-surveillance-following-orchiectomy-for-stage-i-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. For patients without relapse within the first two years of follow-up, the risk of relapse in the five years after being relapse free for two years ranged from 0 to 5.6 percent based upon histology and risk stratification.</p><p>One-half of relapses are retroperitoneal, and of these, one-third are not accompanied by significant elevations in serum tumor markers. An additional one-third of all relapses are in the lungs or mediastinum, while approximately 11 percent are manifested only by elevated serum tumor markers.
