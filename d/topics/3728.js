The degree of thecal sac compression required for the designation of ESCC has been variably defined; we and others consider any radiologic evidence of indentation of the thecal sac to be evidence for ESCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>In adults, the tip of the spinal cord usually lies at the L1 vertebral level; below this level, the lumbosacral nerve roots form the cauda equina, which floats in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Since the pathophysiology of compression of the thecal sac at the level of the cauda equina does not differ significantly from that of more rostral compression, compression of the cauda equina is still generally referred to by the slightly inaccurate name of ESCC.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of ESCC will be reviewed here. The treatment and prognosis of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many cancer patients have asymptomatic or unrecognized ESCC, while others develop ESCC after the decision has been made to forgo extensive diagnostic testing or therapy. For these reasons, the incidence of this complication can only be estimated. One population-based study of spinal cord compression reported that the likelihood of a patient with cancer suffering cord compression in the five years before death was 2.5 percent, ranging from 0.2 percent in pancreatic cancer to 7.9 percent in myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A study of malignant spinal cord compression in hospitalized patients with cancer identified an annual incidence of 3.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Autopsy studies suggested that 5 percent of patients dying with cancer have ESCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Similar findings were noted in a Danish study based upon referrals to a regional treatment center, in which the incidence of ESCC in cancer patients rose from 4.4 to 6 percent between 1979 and 1985 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metastatic tumor from any primary site can produce ESCC, with most cases being due to those tumors with a tendency to metastasize to the spinal column [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. In a population-based series of over 15,000 hospitalizations for ESCC, the three most common underlying cancer diagnoses were lung cancer, breast cancer, and multiple myeloma; the highest incidence rates were seen in patients with multiple myeloma (15 percent), Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (13.9 percent) and prostate cancer (5.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

At autopsy, vertebral metastases in patients have been described in 90 percent of patients dying with prostate cancer, 74 percent with breast cancer, 45 percent with lung cancer, 29 percent with lymphoma or renal cell carcinoma, and 25 percent with gastrointestinal cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The tumors responsible for ESCC in children are different. Sarcomas (especially Ewing) and neuroblastomas are the most frequent causes, followed by germ cell neoplasms and Hodgkin lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">ESCC as initial manifestation of malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 20 percent of cases of ESCC are the initial manifestation of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The distribution of primary tumors in this setting differs from that seen in patients with ESCC and known cancer. This was illustrated by a series of 337 patients, in which lung cancer, cancer of unknown primary site, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma were responsible in 78 percent of cases presenting with ESCC compared to 26 percent of those with a preexisting diagnosis of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In contrast, breast and prostate cancer, which are common causes in patients with known cancer, accounted for only 12 percent.</p><p>Among patients in this study who presented with ESCC, the diagnosis was usually established by percutaneous needle biopsy of the vertebral lesion. Only a minority of these patients had symptoms or physical findings suggestive of the site of the primary tumor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Localization within the spine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ESCC most commonly arises in the thoracic spine. Approximately 60 percent of cases occur in the thoracic spine, 30 percent in the lumbosacral spine, and 10 percent in the cervical spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These percentages are in rough proportion to the combined volumes of the vertebral bodies in each region.</p><p>Some studies have suggested that certain types of tumors have a tendency to metastasize and produce ESCC within specific spinal regions, such as lung cancer in the thoracic spine, and renal, prostate and gastrointestinal cancers in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>]. However, others have been unable to confirm this observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal cord compression is a function of spinal anatomy. The spinal cord is enclosed by a protective ring of bones comprised of the vertebral body anteriorly, the lamina and pedicles laterally and the spinous process posteriorly. Within this ring is the thecal sac, the outermost layer of which is comprised of dura. Between the bone and dura lies the epidural space, which normally contains fat and the venous plexus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>At each spinal level, nerve roots exit lateral to the spinal cord and posterior to the vertebral body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81204\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81204 \">figure 1</a>). Epidural spinal cord compression occurs when tumor invades the epidural space and compresses the thecal sac. The degree of thecal sac compression can range from a minor asymptomatic indentation on the normal thecal sac contour to strangulation of the spinal cord with associated paraplegia.</p><p>Approximately 85 to 90 percent of cases of ESCC are due to metastatic tumor in the vertebral bones, but the mechanism of metastasis varies. Potential mechanisms include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial seeding of bone probably accounts for most cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pelvic tumors, particularly prostate cancer, Batson's venous plexus probably plays an important role. When abdominal pressure is increased by the Valsalva maneuver, venous drainage from the abdomen and pelvis is shunted to the epidural venous plexus, which promotes vertebral metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In approximately 10 percent of cases, a paraspinal mass gains access to the epidural space via the neural foramen; this scenario is particularly common with lymphoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rarely, tumor appears to emanate from the epidural space without a bony or paraspinal component.</p><p/><p>When bone is the source of an epidural mass, the vertebral body is involved in over 80 percent of cases, with involvement of the posterior arch being much less common. Thus, the bulk of tumor is anterior or anterolateral to the thecal sac in most cases of ESCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>].</p><p>As tumor grows in the epidural space, it generally takes the path of least resistance and encircles the thecal sac (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64817\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64817 \">image 1</a>). As the epidural venous plexus becomes obstructed, vasogenic edema may develop in the white matter and eventually the gray matter of the spinal cord. If the epidural tumor is unchecked, spinal cord infarction eventually ensues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The beneficial actions of corticosteroids in ESCC may be related to resolution of vasogenic edema. Prostaglandins and serotonin may be increased in the spinal cord at this level. Consistent with this is the demonstration in animal studies of benefit from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> and serotonin receptor blockers. However, no clinical studies have tested these agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early recognition of the clinical features of ESCC offers more hope of improving outcome than any advances in diagnosis or treatment. Since the primary determinant of the efficacy of therapy is the patient's neurologic status at treatment initiation, the goal must be to establish the diagnosis prior to the development of spinal cord damage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F76541\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef76541 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Unfortunately, the diagnosis is often delayed in patients who have symptoms of back pain for as much two or three months before the diagnosis is established. This was illustrated by a British series of 301 consecutive patients with malignant spinal cord compression, in which the median delay to treatment in those with known malignancy was two months from the onset of back pain and 14 days (range 0 to 84) from the onset of symptoms of spinal cord compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. When this delay was analyzed, three days were due to delays by the patient in seeking attention, four days were attributable to the general practitioner, and four days were due to the hospital.</p><p>Most importantly, the majority of patients deteriorated by at least one grade in motor or bladder function during the delay from initial symptoms of ESCC. The net effect of delayed recognition and therapy is that the majority of patients with newly diagnosed ESCC are not ambulatory at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/6,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,15-17</a>]. Even in recent series, between 48 and 77 percent are not ambulatory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain is usually the first symptom of ESCC, present in 83 to 95 percent of patients at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/6,9,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,21</a>]. On average, pain precedes other neurologic symptoms of ESCC by seven weeks. Affected patients usually notice a severe local back pain, at the level of the lesion, which progressively increases in intensity.</p><p>Pain is often worse with recumbency and at night, possibly related to distension of the epidural venous plexus when laying down or to diurnal variation in levels of endogenous corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Pain present only on movement suggests spinal instability, a finding that may demand a surgical approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome#H679515503\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;, section on 'Assessing spinal stability'</a>.)</p><p>Local pain may be due to disruption of the periosteum or dural nerves, the spinal cord, or paravertebral soft tissue. The frequent alleviation of pain with corticosteroids suggests that neural compression plays a significant role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Over time, the pain may develop a radicular quality. It may, for example, radiate into a limb with movement of the spine or Valsalva maneuver. Radicular pain is more common in lumbosacral lesions than in thoracic lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Thoracic radicular pain is commonly bilateral and wraps around anteriorly in a bandlike fashion. Abrupt worsening of pain may herald a pathologic compression fracture. </p><p>Referred pain from ESCC is uncommon but when it occurs, it can be misleading in terms of localizing the lesion. One example is an L1 vertebral metastasis manifesting as pain in the area of the sacroiliac joint. Another example is compression of ascending spinal cord tracts in the cervical cord manifesting as sciatic pain; this phenomenon is sometimes called funicular pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Motor findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weakness is present in 60 to 85 percent of patients with ESCC at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/16,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,21</a>]. When the lesion is at or above the conus medullaris, weakness is from corticospinal dysfunction and has the typical pyramidal pattern, preferentially affecting the flexors in the lower extremities and, if above the thoracic spine, the extensors of the upper extremities. Hyperreflexia below the level of the compression and extensor plantar responses may be seen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;, section on 'Conus medullaris syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>ESCC generally produces fairly symmetric lower extremity weakness. With cauda equina lesions, the weakness is associated with depressed deep tendon reflexes in the legs. A laterally situated epidural lesion may preferentially affect a nerve root exiting the neural foramen and produce a superimposed or isolated motor radiculopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;, section on 'Cauda equina syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>The progression of motor findings prior to diagnosis typically consists of increasing weakness followed sequentially by loss of gait function and paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In most large series, the majority of patients are not ambulatory at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/6,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,15-17</a>]. This is usually secondary to weakness, although patients with ESCC are often discouraged from walking because of severe pain with movement. The severity of weakness is greatest in patients with thoracic metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Sensory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sensory findings are less common than motor findings but are still present in a majority of patients at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients frequently report ascending numbness and paresthesias if questioned and examined carefully.</p><p>When a spinal sensory level is present, it is typically one to five levels below the actual level of cord compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

MRI of the thecal sac can provide an accurate evaluation of the extent of disease within the thecal sac and of involvement of adjacent soft tissues and bone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69428\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69428 \">image 2</a>).</p><p>Potential advantages of MRI compared to other imaging modalities include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI produces anatomically faithful images of the spinal cord and intramedullary pathology. MRI also defines the adjacent bone and soft tissues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI can image the entire thecal sac regardless of whether a spinal subarachnoid block is present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI is not contraindicated in patients with brain metastases, thrombocytopenia, or coagulopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI avoids the need for a lumbar or cervical puncture, which is required with myelography.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some instances when recumbent pain prevents the patient from lying still for either MRI or myelography (see below), a bolus of corticosteroids may relieve pain sufficiently to allow the procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Myelography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myelography, often combined with computed tomography (CT) after the introduction of a contrast agent, was frequently used in patients with suspected ESCC prior to the widespread utilization of MRI. Several studies comparing CT myelogram with MRI found that the two technologies were roughly equivalent in sensitivity and specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. CT myelography is still widely used in treatment planning for radiosurgery.</p><p>Situations where CT myelography may retain utility include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occasional cases, particularly with laterally located lesions, in which CT myelogram demonstrates abnormalities that are not visualized with MRI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with mechanical valves, pacemakers, paramagnetic implants, and shrapnel, where MRI is not possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myelography may be better tolerated by patients in considerable pain, since MRI depends upon the ability of the patient to lie still.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A myelogram permits cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, which is the cornerstone of the diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases.</p><p/><p>Rarely, patients with complete subarachnoid block deteriorate neurologically when CSF pressure below the block has been reduced by the lumbar puncture. For this reason, it is frequently useful to have neurosurgical input when a myelogram is considered for suspected ESCC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Other modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several other imaging modalities have been used in patients with suspected ESCC. None are reliable enough to replace either MRI or myelography as an initial screening procedure.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography &ndash; CT of the spine does not demonstrate the spinal cord or epidural space clearly. In patients without severe osteoporosis, it can depict metastatic disruption of the bony cortex surrounding the spinal canal, a finding that is highly predictive of epidural tumor extension. Although CT retains some utility in conjunction with myelography, its use has largely been replaced by MRI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiography &ndash; Plain spinal radiographs are the easiest study to obtain and are of value in certain situations. In a cancer patient with back pain, either major vertebral body collapse or pedicle erosion with a matching radiculopathy predicts a 75 to 83 percent chance of ESCC when a definitive study is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].<br/><br/>However, false negative plain spinal radiographs occur in 10 to 17 percent of patients with ESCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>], and plain radiography should not be used as a screening procedure in patients with suspected ESCC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone scan &ndash; Radionuclide bone scanning is more sensitive for detecting bony metastasis than plain spinal radiographs, and a single study has the advantage of visualizing the entire skeleton. However, bone scans may be negative in neoplasms without increased blood flow or new bone formation, as is frequently the case in multiple myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Furthermore, bone scanning is not informative about thecal sac compression.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer patients are prone to malignant, non-ESCC causes of back pain and neurologic dysfunction, as well as common nonmalignant causes of these symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Musculoskeletal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign causes of back pain that should be considered include muscle spasm, intervertebral disk disease, and spinal stenosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbar-spinal-stenosis-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbar spinal stenosis: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One feature that is sometimes helpful in differentiating pain of ESCC from benign causes of back pain is thoracic localization; the benign causes generally occur in the lumbar or cervical spine. The patient whose spine pain worsens with recumbency should not be presumed to have a benign cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal epidural abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal epidural abscess is an uncommon condition. Predisposing factors include intravenous drug use, vertebral osteomyelitis, and hematogenous infection. The clinical manifestations may be indistinguishable from rapidly progressive neoplastic ESCC. Neuroimaging may suggest infection but, in some cases, biopsy will be necessary for diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-epidural-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal epidural abscess&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The leading bacterial pathogen causing spinal epidural abscess is Staphylococcus aureus, which accounts for approximately two-thirds of cases of bacterial etiology. Other infectious causes include Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is responsible for up to 25 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skeletal-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skeletal tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Metastatic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of other manifestations of metastatic disease can cause severe pain and enter into the differential diagnosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vertebral metastases without epidural extension frequently produce local back pain which may be severe. Differentiation from ESCC requires neuroimaging studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intramedullary metastases occur much less frequently than epidural metastases and are most commonly associated with lung cancer. They produce pain, weakness, and numbness similar to ESCC. Unlike ESCC, they often produce a hemicord syndrome of unilateral weakness below the level of the lesion with contralateral diminution of pinprick and temperature discrimination; continued growth can lead to subsequent bilateral spinal cord dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

Local back pain may not be present but affected patients usually complain of radicular pain. MRI demonstrates no epidural tumor and may show pathologic leptomeningeal enhancement. CSF examination is usually diagnostic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-leptomeningeal-metastases-from-solid-tumors#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases from solid tumors&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignant plexopathy may involve any of the peripheral nerve plexuses. In most cases, the major clinical feature of malignant plexopathy is severe unrelenting local or radicular pain. Later, weakness and focal sensory disturbances occur in the distribution of the involved plexuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In the absence of a palpable mass or ipsilateral extremity swelling, these symptoms can mimic ESCC. The paraspinal location of the plexus means that ESCC and malignant plexopathy often coexist. MRI or CT scanning can differentiate between these possibilities. Brachial plexopathy most commonly occurs in patients with breast and lung cancers. Lumbosacral plexopathy is usually due to colorectal and gynecologic tumors, sarcomas, and lymphomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cancer pain syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation myelopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, patients who have previously received radiation to the spine or nearby structures develop chronic progressive radiation myelopathy.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of spinal cord irradiation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Affected patients usually develop painless ascending numbness and upper motor neuron findings that often have a hemicord localization, presumably because radiation has produced a vascular lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].
