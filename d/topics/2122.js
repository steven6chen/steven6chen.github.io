In order to approach the desired level of zero risk from transfused allogeneic blood, multiple layers of safety are needed. Methods used in attempting to maximize safety from donated allogeneic units include donor selection criteria, donor medical history interview, donor deferral registries, laboratory testing of donated units, donor initiated telephone call backs, and modification of the blood unit after collection, either by leukocyte removal or pathogen inactivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>In addition to these recipient protections, the evaluation of each prospective blood donor includes procedures intended to assure that the donor will not suffer any adverse reactions from the donation itself or from hematopoietic growth factors employed to facilitate donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>This discussion will provide an overview of the procedures involved in blood donor screening. Specific aspects of blood donor screening including medical history and laboratory testing are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-medical-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Medical history&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTABLISHMENT OF PROCEDURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When it is first suspected that an infectious agent may be transmitted by transfusion, the initial response is to develop donor deferral policies using epidemiologic data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. After this initial step, subsequent review and debate often leads to the nationwide implementation of a particular donor screening procedure following recommendations of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the AABB (formerly the American Association of Blood Banks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Once implemented, screening procedures tend to become permanent due to the current regulatory, political, and legal climate, even if their efficacy cannot be established.</p><p>For many diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD), which has not been proven to be transfusion transmitted, variant CJD, babesiosis, and malaria, non-laboratory donor screening procedures are the only method available for increasing transfusion safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. By contrast, for infectious diseases for which routine blood donor testing is performed (eg, HIV, HTLV, hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis B virus), the importance of non-laboratory donor screening procedures relates to their ability to identify some potentially infectious donors during the infectious window period that precedes the development of a positive laboratory test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69661\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69661 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>].</p><p>While there are distinct advantages to eliminating donors with possible risks of disease transmission, there are also negative consequences of this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Because donor deferral criteria often have poor specificity, a large number of safe donors will be deferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although this dilemma has been well recognized, there is no available algorithm to decide if a given procedure or screening question should be implemented. Such decisions attempt to balance the following factors: the extent of disease transmission, the severity of the consequences of such disease to the recipient, the expected sensitivity (effectiveness) of the procedure, and the number of donors lost by implementation of the procedure. Deferral policies to protect against the theoretical risk of transfusion transmission of variant CJD have tended to choose potential recipient safety over blood availability.

The result has been the elimination of paid donors from the whole blood collection system in the United States. Thus, volunteer donors are the source of the red cells, platelets, and plasma products such as Fresh Frozen Plasma and cryoprecipitate transfused to patients. In contrast, payment to plasmapheresis donors still occurs; these donors contribute units of plasma that are pooled together, subjected to pathogen inactivation techniques, and manufactured into plasma derivatives such as albumin, intravenous and intramuscular immunoglobulins, and factor VIII and IX concentrates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">Non-cash incentives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incentives other than the direct payment of cash (eg, time off from work, gifts, monetary credit for blood non- replacement fees, free cholesterol and PSA screening) also are used to encourage people to donate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Although there has been concern that such incentives may have an adverse influence on blood safety, several reports suggest that some incentives given to first time or repeat donors do not have an adverse effect on blood safety, as monitored by donor infectious disease testing results. However, these same data are lacking with regard to the influence of incentives on the safety profile of current non-donors who might be influenced to become donors by the incentives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>].</p><p>Another incentive that historically appeared to have motivated some people to donate blood is the ability to obtain a free and confidential HIV antibody test result as part of the process of blood donation. Post-donation interviews with HIV seropositive donors in the 1980s indicated that the motivation for donation in 15 to 29 percent was to obtain their HIV antibody test result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Furthermore, in an anonymous mail survey conducted in 1993, 6 percent of donors indicated that they had donated blood at some time in the past to obtain an HIV antibody test and 3.2 percent stated that they had done so within the past 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In a similar survey conducted in 1998, the latter number decreased to 1.0 percent, with the majority of such donors indicating that they had done so for financial or convenience reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>To address this issue, blood centers provide information to blood donors about the inappropriateness of HIV test-seeking behavior. Some centers have adopted additional approaches such as specifically asking donors if they are donating to get an HIV test or offering free HIV testing to people who desire it without requiring that a blood donation be made.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H765715\"><span class=\"h3\">Restriction of mobile blood drive locations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the known spread of hepatitis between individuals inhabiting particular types of institutions, blood collection agencies do not collect blood at homes for the intellectually disabled or in prisons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Donors with hereditary hemochromatosis or other conditions requiring therapeutic phlebotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An additional donor incentive arises in the case of patients with disorders that require periodic phlebotomy, such as hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). From one point of view, donating blood may save a patient as much as 200 dollars per venesection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. From another standpoint, a healthy person is available to <strong>regularly</strong> donate as many as 50 units of whole blood per year. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The FDA has adopted a policy that permits collection of blood from patients with HH without any special unit labeling, provided that an individual blood center applies to the FDA for an exemption to the labeling rule. In order to qualify for this exemption, the blood center must perform therapeutic phlebotomies for HH at no charge, hence removing the monetary incentive for a patient to be a donor, and must agree to collect data on viral markers and adverse reaction rates in these donors as well as data on adverse reactions in recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Patients with HH must still meet all other qualification criteria for allogeneic donation. Many blood centers in the United States and other countries will accept such donations. An international survey of blood services in 33 countries found that approximately two-thirds of respondents would accept donors with a known HH mutation and that one-quarter would accept patients who were diagnosed with and being treated for HH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>There are some primary data suggesting that donors with HH are no less safe than other donors; this conclusion was also reached in a systematic review of observational studies that also noted that there were few studies available and that the quality of the evidence was low to very low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In one large-scale United States study, an anonymous mail survey of blood donors was completed in 1998 before the HH policy change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The study found that the prevalence of unreported deferrable risks for transfusion-transmissible viral infections (TTVIs) was similar in patients with HH (who donated inappropriately despite their diagnosis) and standard community allogeneic donors (2.0 and 3.1 percent, respectively). The overall prevalence of positive screening test results for TTVIs was also similar (1.3 and 1.6 percent, respectively). In an in vitro study, red blood cells (RBCs) from blood units collected from 12 donors with HH and from 10 random regular donors were stored for up to 42 days (the maximal allowable storage period) and compared in terms of their biophysical, biochemical, and immunomodulatory properties. Although minor differences were found, the authors concluded that RBCs from HH patients appear suitable for transfusion purposes according to accepted in vitro criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Several studies have assessed the impact of collecting blood from donors with HH:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, 69 of 211 individuals (33 percent) with HH were ineligible as potential blood donors, and only 65 percent of the units obtained from potentially eligible donor-patients during the initial weekly (iron depletion stage) phlebotomy treatments were acceptable for transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. However, this increased to 88 percent during the maintenance stage of therapy (ie, one to four phlebotomies per year).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a second series, 76 percent of 130 individuals with HH met eligibility criteria for allogeneic donation. No incident seroconversions for agents of transfusion-transmissible disease occurred during 1402 donations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Twenty-seven months after starting the program, HH donors were contributing 14 percent of the RBC units collected for allogeneic use at this small blood center. In addition, donors with HH kept their donation appointments significantly more often than non-HH donors (89 versus 75 percent).</p><p/><p>Although these latter data suggest that collecting blood from patients with HH is a promising way to increase overall RBC donations, such programs are not universally available in community blood centers because of the financial issues involved in offering free therapeutic phlebotomies.</p><p>In contrast to HH, persons who undergo therapeutic phlebotomy for other conditions such as polycythemia vera, a myeloproliferative neoplasm, are not eligible to be blood donors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Screening at the donation site</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2746519653\"><span class=\"h4\">Donor medical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major procedure for screening donors at the donation site is the medical history interview that contains questions to protect the recipient from acquiring a transfusion-transmitted infection and to protect the donor from suffering an adverse reaction after donation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-medical-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Medical history&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the United States, the sex of the donor is recorded. Pregnancy history is not collected for female donors of RBC units because donor sex does not appear to affect transfusion outcomes (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters#H75183218\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in adults: Storage, specialized modifications, and infusion parameters&quot;, section on 'Effect of donor characteristics (eg, donor sex and age) on transfusion outcomes'</a>). By contrast, female donors or multiparous female donors are deferred from donating plasma as part of a risk mitigation strategy to reduce the risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI); this subject is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali#H11655925\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)&quot;, section on 'Deferral of multiparous female donors'</a>.)</p><p>Other donation site procedures to enhance safety include the use of a donor deferral registry. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Registry of deferred donors'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h4\">Registry of deferred donors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An additional mechanism to protect recipients is the use of a registry of deferred donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. These computerized registries include identifying information from donors who have been deferred for specified reasons. The donor deferral registry can be used in one of two ways. In most blood centers, the donor's name is checked against the deferral registry prior to donation; no blood is collected if the donor is listed on the registry. This method is highly desirable in that it avoids the unnecessary phlebotomy of ineligible donors and it prevents the potential for an error leading to the release of the ineligible donor unit. The alternate method of complying with the requirements for a donor deferral registry is to collect the unit from the donor and to subsequently, at a central location, check the donor deferral registry prior to placing the unit into inventory. The unit is quarantined and destroyed if the donor's name was found on the registry.</p><p>Individual blood centers have established these in-house (local) donor deferral registries to comply with a section of the Code of Federal Regulations that states that persons who have ever tested positive for HBsAg or anti-HIV should no longer be accepted as blood donors. The rationale of donor deferral registries is that individuals with a previous positive test result may revert to a negative test result at a later date even though they could still transmit disease. This situation could occur either because of a biologic phenomenon or a testing error.</p><p>Donor deferral registries also include the names of donors who have previously volunteered information (eg, history of intravenous drug use, hepatitis, or high risk AIDS activity) that should have permanently excluded them as blood donors. Donors who volunteer such information at one visit may be tempted to withhold this information at a subsequent visit, especially if their self-assessment is that the history ought not to have precluded them as blood donors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H765782\"><span class=\"h3\">Donor deferral based upon investigation of disease in the recipient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On occasion, a hospital or physician will report a case of potential infectious disease or transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) in a recipient to the blood center, so that a donor investigation can be performed. If an implicated (causative) donor is found during the blood center's investigation, that donor will be deferred from future donation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-donation screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary post-donation procedure for enhancing recipient safety is laboratory testing of the donated unit for multiple infectious disease markers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A second safety procedure is the telephone callback. At the time of blood donation, donors receive instructions that they may call the blood center sometime after the donation to report additional pertinent medical history information. Telephone callbacks fall into two prominent categories.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Donors may call back to report the development of an acute illness, such as fever, upper respiratory tract infection, or a gastrointestinal disorder, occurring from several hours to several days post-donation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Donors may call back to indicate risk factors for HIV or other infectious diseases that might not have been disclosed at the time of donation.</p><p/><p>Blood centers must have established policies for managing post-donation telephone callback information. In general, if post-donation information would have caused the donor to be deferred, blood centers will quarantine and destroy any components that have not yet been shipped and will transmit such information to the hospital transfusion services that have received components from the donation. The transfusion service will retrieve any such components that are still in their inventory and either return them to the blood center or destroy them. Post-donation information that affects the eligibility evaluation of the donor must be reported by licensed blood establishments to the FDA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">PROTECTION OF THE DONOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risks to the donor from blood donation are very small for healthy individuals; however, complications may occur in individuals whose cardiovascular status does not permit adequate compensation for volume depletion or anemia. Thus, deferral criteria for the protection of the donor are based upon establishing that the donor is not likely to have an increased risk of immediate post-donation reactions, a post-donation reaction that is especially severe or prolonged, or cardiovascular factors that do not permit adequate compensation.</p><p>Procedures for protection of the donor include assessing the donor's total blood volume; and monitoring the donor's pulse, blood pressure, and adequacy of the donor's hemoglobin level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/5,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,42</a>].

Reactions were significantly more common in females than males overall (11.3 versus 4.8 percent); rates were similar when donors weighing &lt;150 pounds were excluded from analysis (5.7 versus 4.6 percent).</p><p>Similar results were obtained from a 2006 prospective study from nine American Red Cross blood centers that routinely collect blood from 16- to 19-year-olds, a population that accounted for 14.5 percent of annual donations.

On multivariate analysis, young age (odds ratio 3.0), first time donation status (OR 2.6), and female sex (OR 1.9) had the strongest association with complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rates of physical injury from syncope-related falls were significantly greater in the youngest donors, and were 5.9, 2.4, and 0.4 (events per 10,000 collections) in donors who were 16 to 17, 18 to 19, or &gt;20 years of age, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given that, in the study cited above, most reactions occurred either immediately after donation or at the refreshment table, it would seem most prudent to make sure the donor feels well before being allowed to walk to the refreshment table and is encouraged to stay at the table for at least 10 to 15 minutes for observation and fluid replenishment. A further recommendation would be to have the donor sit in a forward leaning position with elbows and forearms on the table and feet flat on the floor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. Should syncope occur, the donor would be more likely fall forward onto the table, rather than sideways towards the floor.</p><p>Donors who develop presyncope or syncope should assume the supine position with legs raised or Trendelenburg position at the onset of such symptoms. Some may require smelling salts (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aromatic-ammonia-spirit-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aromatic ammonia spirit</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prevention of adverse reactions may be especially necessary in younger donors, who are more likely to develop an adverse reaction to blood donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. As an example, in one study 16-year-old donors who experienced even a minor complication were significantly less likely to return to donate within 12 months than 16-year-olds who experienced uncomplicated donations (52 versus 73 percent, respectively; odds ratio 0.40; 95% CI 0.36-0.44) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p>A small randomized trial testing the ability of pre-donation water ingestion to attenuate negative reactions to blood donation was performed in 83 first-time blood donors recruited from a population of college undergraduate students [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Participants assigned to ingest 500 mL of bottled water 30 minutes before donation had a 47 percent reduction of mild donation reaction symptoms (eg, dizziness, lightheadedness) when compared with the group not ingesting water pre-donation. The benefit of water ingestion did not vary as a function of the donors' existing hydration level, as measured by bioimpedance analysis.</p><p>Another study noted that vasovagal reactions (VVR) were common (6 of 31, 19 percent) in a small number of individuals who had heart rate increases &ge;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span> during 5 minutes of standing either before or after blood donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. In the second part of this study, 46 of these &quot;high-risk&quot; donors ingested 300 mL of water 15 minutes before blood donation. This maneuver significantly reduced their heart rate increase after standing, and resulted in a lower incidence of VVR (2 of 45, 4 percent).</p><p>A larger trial, involving 8894 donations from high school students, indicated a 21 to 28 percent reduction in the donor vasovagal reaction rate in those randomly assigned to receive a 473 mL (16 ounces) water drink before their donation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].

Indications for deferral of the donor include a hemoglobin less than 12.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for women and 13.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for men, temperature above 37.5&deg;C, blood pressure above 180 mmHg systolic or 100 mmHg diastolic, pulse outside the established limits of 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute,</span> certain arrhythmias detected on pulse examination, and a variety of medical conditions. Measurement of pre-donation hemoglobin level serves to detect potential donors who are anemic, and low hemoglobin renders them ineligible to donate, thereby protecting them against further reduction of hemoglobin mass. There are no routinely performed direct measures of iron deficiency in the absence of anemia. Based on demographic characteristics and donation history, some blood centers recommend that certain groups of donors (pre-menopausal females, frequent repeat donors) consider oral iron supplementation.
