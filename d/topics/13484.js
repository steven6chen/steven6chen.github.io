A personality disorder is diagnosed when personality traits are so inflexible and maladaptive across a wide range of situations that they cause significant distress and impairment of social, occupational, and role functioning. The thinking, displays of emotion, impulsivity, and interpersonal behavior of the individual must deviate markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture in order to qualify as a personality disorder.</p><p>Patients with personality disorders can significantly strain the doctor-patient relationship. Clinicians frequently lack training in how to recognize and manage personality disorders. </p><p>This topic provides an overview of the personality disorders. Borderline, antisocial, narcissistic, schizotypal personality disorders are reviewed in detail separately. Challenges to maintaining a therapeutic alliance in the treatment of patients with personality disorders and pathological personality traits are also discussed separately.

Barriers to developing an effective doctor-patient alliance may arise related to patient distrust, irritability, poor communication skills, dependency, or excessive demands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-personality-disorders/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients run the risk of alienating health care providers with late night phone calls, angry outbursts, repeated visits or admissions, signing out against medical advice, or being otherwise noncompliant with recommended treatment. </p><p>The clinician&rsquo;s reactions to the patient&rsquo;s affect or interpersonal behavior (particularly a negative reaction in the clinician) can further challenge all aspects of the treatment, though this frustration, annoyance, and negative perception of the patient can also be useful diagnostically or at least point in the direction that one might be dealing with a patient who has a personality disorder. The clinician needs to be aware of and manage these feelings (often referred to as countertransference), perhaps through a discussion with a colleague, since it is very difficult to treat effectively a patient whom you do not like. </p><p>Dysfunctional behaviors related to medication issues that typify some types of personality disorder include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discontinuing prescribed medication in the personal belief that herbal therapy is more effective (narcissistic personality)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lying about compliance with treatment (antisocial personality)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Misinterpretation of delay in the clinician returning a phone call, leading to feeling of rejection and acting out by stopping or overdosing on a medication (borderline personality)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Worry about unusual side effects from a prescribed medication, such as blocking the body from absorbing essential nutrients or vitamins, or belief that one is being tricked by a generic substitution into taking something harmful (schizotypal personality)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Becoming angry when not told of an infrequent or minor drug side effect one had looked up while researching his medications (obsessive-compulsive personality)</p><p/><p>Patients with personality disorders often lack insight regarding the connection between their behaviors and interpersonal difficulties. Patients commonly externalize their difficulties, seeing the problem as how people react to them rather than themselves as the problem, and argue that their behavior was appropriate given the provocation by another. In therapy, the patient may similarly interpret the interpersonal difficulties as being generated by the therapist and not as a result or consequence of his or her own behavior.</p><p>The clinician&rsquo;s awareness of his or her affective reactions and interpersonal experiences with the patient can be useful in the recognition and management of patients with personality disorders. The clinician may feel angry, threatened, defensive, or incompetent, or may find it difficult to feel any emotional connection with the patient. Alternatively, the clinician may find him or herself preoccupied with the patient without any specific event or attribute that would reasonably induce such involvement.

Shows rigidity and stubbornness.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A treatment plan should be developed, discussed and modified over time with input from the patient and others involved in his or her support. This treatment plan for personality pathology may include individual and group therapy, medication, self-education, specialized substance use disorder treatment, partial hospitalization, or brief hospitalization during times of crises. Medications are generally used only as adjuncts to psychotherapy in patients with personality disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1967313327\"><span class=\"h2\">Referral to a mental health professional</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients significantly impaired by a personality disorder will most often benefit from early referral to a mental health professional. Such patients often require much time and often particular skills are needed in dealing with these complicated patients, and the primary care clinician may not have the expertise or available time to address their needs. </p><p>There may be a shortage of mental health resources in some areas, and especially a shortage of clinicians who are trained or skilled in working with this challenging group of patients. </p><p>Mental health professionals vary in their level of comfort and experience treating patients with personality disorders. It is helpful to identify particular mental health professionals or treatment programs in a community specializing in providing care for such patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1415054269\"><span class=\"h2\">Discussing the diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To have a frank and open discussion about treatment options with a patient, the diagnosis should be discussed with <span class=\"nowrap\">him/her</span> in most cases. Many mental health professionals are reluctant to discuss the diagnosis of a personality disorder, for a number of reasons including: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician&rsquo;s fear that the patient will get angry at him or her, especially when the patient is emotionally labile, paranoid, or quick to anger. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis is often felt to be less than clear, having been impacted by the patient&rsquo;s cognitions, affect, and interpersonal behavior, compounded by countertransference, and further affected by other difficult feelings that arise in both the patient and therapist during the course of the treatment. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician may feel guilty about applying a diagnosis of personality disorder to a patient due to perceptions of negative connotations and stigma. </p><p/><p>The only way to confront the negative impressions and stigma is to educate the patient as to what we know about the diagnosis. Among the personality disorders, only guidance for borderline personality disorder about how to discuss the diagnosis with the patient is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-personality-disorders/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>The therapist might begin the discussion with the patient by labeling it (eg, &ldquo;I would like to have a frank discussion and interchange about your diagnosis&rdquo;). The clinician should explain why the therapist thinks the patient does have a personality disorder, while constantly being sensitive to the fact that the patient probably automatically attaches stigma, if not denigration, to the diagnosis.</p><p>The discussion should take place when there is enough time for a full and frank interchange. The patient should be encouraged to ask questions, to disagree, and to express whatever concerns <span class=\"nowrap\">s/he</span> might have about being labeled with the diagnosis. The patient should be encouraged to make note of any thoughts or concerns about the discussion that should come to mind during the session or between sessions. The responses from the therapist should be both empathic as well as framed in the spirit of educating the patient about the diagnosis and empathizing with the idea that there are many misconceptions that would lead one to not want to be labeled with the diagnosis. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">The clinician-patient relationship</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For any patient, how a treatment plan is presented, including discussion of medication side effects, the usual time course to response, possible postoperative complications, anticipated pain, etc influences compliance with the plan. Guidelines about when and how to contact the treating clinician are helpful. This communication takes on even greater importance for patients with personality disorder. Compared to the general population, patients with personality disorder have greater sensitivity to side effects, tend to take more of a drug than prescribed and more alternative medications (herbals and other natural treatments), and are at increased risk for concurrent use of illicit drugs and alcohol. A family member, spouse, or friend can be recruited to help the patient, if <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> agrees, to maintain adherence to prescribed medication or rehabilitation regimen. This can be particularly helpful during a crisis, when heightened emotions, eg, impulsiveness or hopelessness may lead <span class=\"nowrap\">him/her</span> to suddenly interrupt a work-up or treatment.</p><p>Problems that may arise in the clinical management of the care of patients with a personality disorder are best managed by fostering a relationship in which the patient is comfortable talking about concerns, although direct communication often does not come easily to people with personality disorder. It is sometimes most efficient to tell a patient to call the office or the nurse if he should have a worry about a treatment plan. In the case of medication, one might say something such as &quot;I certainly do not want you to take a medication that is making you feel worse, but I would also hate to have you stop a medication because you thought you have a reaction. Often the body takes a few days to adjust to the medication so please let us know if you have concerns.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H26592183\" class=\"local\">'Manifestations in clinical care'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approaches-to-the-therapeutic-relationship-in-patients-with-personality-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approaches to the therapeutic relationship in patients with personality disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26592177\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychotherapy is generally regarded as first-line for patients with personality disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-personality-disorders/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].
