Typically, such procedures are associated with a small volume of blood loss (&lt;250 mL), a short course of anesthesia (&lt;3 hours), a small volume of intravenous fluid administration during surgery (&lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg),</span> and little to no extravascular fluid shift in patients without significant organ dysfunction. </p><p>However, in many cases, postoperative patients with extensive traumatic or surgical tissue injury, burns, critical illness, or sepsis will require replacement fluid therapy in addition to maintenance therapy to compensate for preoperative and intraoperative losses, the stress response to surgery, the underlying disease state, ongoing gastrointestinal fluid loss, blood loss, and other bodily fluid loss. Such complex fluid management is often needed for patients who undergo surgical procedures that result in significant blood loss (&gt;500 mL or 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], hemodynamic instability, anesthesia time &gt;3 hours, large-volume intravenous fluid administration (&gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg),</span> fluid shifting out of the vascular space (&quot;third-spacing&quot;), and major organ dysfunction. </p><p>The prescription of maintenance and replacement fluids in postoperative surgical patients is reviewed here. The management of electrolyte abnormalities and nutritional support in the perioperative period are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postoperative electrolyte abnormalities&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-perioperative-nutritional-support\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of perioperative nutritional support&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-parenteral-nutrition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative parenteral nutrition&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1331954772\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGIC STRESS RESPONSE TO SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The stress response to traumatic or surgical tissue injury is a primal collection of biochemical pathways designed to facilitate survival following a major insult. The &quot;fight or flight&quot; response promotes expansion of the blood volume, glucose availability, perfusion of vital organs, and inflammation. This stress response is triggered by entry into a major body cavity (eg, chest, abdomen, joint, cranium), significant tissue disruption (eg, severe burn wounds, long bone fracture, penetrating gunshot wound, pancreatitis), significant blood loss (&gt;500 mL or 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg),</span> and hemodynamic instability. Similarly, infection, such as abscess formation or sepsis, will also stimulate a stress response. </p><p>Some devices used in surgery may also incite a massive inflammatory response. As an example, extracorporeal bypass uses an external circuit through which blood is forced for gas exchange and circulation while the patient undergoes cardiothoracic surgery. Blood contact with artificial bypass tubing incites cytokine release, activation of the coagulation cascade, and the production of nitric oxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In conjunction with the stress response to surgery, this inflammatory response may lead to vasodilation, deranged coagulation, systemic capillary leak, and systemic organ dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3471303490\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormonal mediators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hormonal mediators of the stress response include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasopressin &ndash; Vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), is secreted by the posterior pituitary gland in response to elevated plasma osmolality, low circulating blood volume, and stress. This results in water retention by the kidney, which expands the vascular volume. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aldosterone &ndash; The renin-angiotensin axis responds to volume contraction by stimulating aldosterone secretion in the adrenal gland. Aldosterone increases sodium and water retention by the kidney, thereby expanding the vascular volume.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cortisol &ndash; The hypothalamic-pituitary axis responds to stress by stimulating cortisol release from the adrenal gland. This promotes gluconeogenesis and muscle breakdown and results in hyperglycemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catecholamines &ndash; Epinephrine and norepinephrine are released from the adrenal gland in response to sympathetic nervous system stimulation, resulting in vasoconstriction, tachycardia, and catabolism. This combination leads to increased cardiac output, hypertension, and hyperglycemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytokines &ndash; Acute phase reactants (eg, interleukins 1 and 6) generate a local inflammatory response at the site of injury, facilitating healing at sites of tissue disruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p/><p>The stress response to tissue injury helps the body to compensate for hypovolemia in the appropriately supported postoperative patient. However, complications of the stress response can occur. As an example, aldosterone production leads to potassium wasting and secondary hypokalemia. If not appropriately treated, severe hypokalemia can result in arrhythmias and rhabdomyolysis. Similarly, cortisol and catecholamines contribute to hyperglycemia, which is associated with wound complications in postoperative patients, including infection, dehiscence, and nonhealing. Furthermore, systemic release of inflammatory mediators may result in local <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systemic capillary leak, tissue injury, and systemic organ dysfunction (eg, acute renal failure, adult respiratory distress syndrome, abdominal compartment syndrome). </p><p>Distinguishing hypovolemia from the stress response in the postoperative patient can be challenging. In the past, manifestations of the stress response, including tachycardia, hypotension, and oliguria, were attributed to hypovolemia and inadequate fluid resuscitation in the postoperative patient. For this reason, much of postoperative fluid management was focused on resolving these physiologic derangements with large-volume fluid resuscitation. The result of aggressive fluid resuscitation was complications of volume overload, contributing to morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Our understanding of the stress response to surgery has evolved. In a 2016 statement on sepsis, the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine recognized that the stress response exists as a spectrum of organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. A similar degree of organ dysfunction may be observed in cases of exaggerated stress response in the absence of infection (eg, pancreatitis). As such, organ dysfunction (ie, tachycardia, hypotension, oliguria, rising creatinine) in the postoperative patient may not reflect inadequate fluid resuscitation; rather, such dysfunction may be a manifestation of a pathologic stress response to the underlying disease or to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. For this reason, new protocols, such as the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol, are emerging to limit the fluid therapy in surgical patients and may actually include &quot;permissive oliguria&quot; in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H945124557\"><span class=\"h1\">FLUID LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluid losses in the postoperative period vary widely with the type of procedure performed, the condition of the patient at the time of surgery, the underlying disease for which the procedure was performed, and the severity of the stress response associated with the procedure, injury, or disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1478800851\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding should always be considered in postoperative patients with hypotension, tachycardia, dizziness, or pallor. However, these manifestations are late, occurring only after blood loss is in excess of 15 percent of the patient's blood volume (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107655\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107655 \">table 1</a>). While fluid administration is appropriate to support the patient, blood products are often required to correct the acute blood loss anemia. In cases of occult bleeding, imaging may be needed to identify the bleeding source. In most cases, a return to the operating room is indicated for exploration and control of hemorrhage at the surgical site. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1035924462\"><span class=\"h2\">Drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrointestinal suction drainage systems (eg, nasogastric tube) may evacuate large volumes of fluid during or following a surgical procedure (eg, small bowel obstruction) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107239\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107239 \">table 2</a>). Similarly, surgical entry into the chest (ie, pleural fluid from a chest tube), abdomen (ie, ascites from abdominal drains), or urinary system (ie, urine) may lead to the rapid evacuation of a large volume of fluid. For fluid evacuation in excess of one liter, hypovolemia and electrolyte derangement may result if the fluid is not adequately replaced. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4005841940\"><span class=\"h2\">Third-spacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Third-spacing refers to the process of capillary leak and extravasation of protein-rich serum into the interstitial spaces of the soft tissues (eg, skin, fat, muscle), organs, deep space cavities (eg, chest, abdomen), or retroperitoneum. It typically occurs during the first 72 hours following major surgery and is associated with a heightened stress response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third-spacing into the soft tissue results in edema, whereas fluid that leaks from the peritoneal or pleural surfaces generates ascites or pleural effusion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large nonanatomic cavities, such as those created from extensive subcutaneous dissection or following drainage of an infected pancreatic pseudocyst, can result in large-volume third-spacing into the newly created potential space. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spaces that are created during surgery (eg, the hernia cavity that remains following ventral hernia repair), in which the tissues are not approximated, can result in postoperative seroma. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reperfusion following an episode of ischemia, such as in cases of arterial occlusion, result in an intense local inflammatory response and extensive tissue edema, which can lead to compartment syndromes.</p><p/><p>Hypoalbuminemia contributes to third-spacing; it is theorized that the resultant intravascular oncotic pressure, resulting from hypoalbuminemia, contributes to the fluid shifting. Some fluids contain higher concentrations of albumin, such as ascites, which may impact hemodynamics in a more impressive way. As an example, in a post hoc analysis of 31 patients involved in a trial to assess intravenous fluid administration following cytoreductive surgery, the evacuation of malignant ascites in excess of 500 mL caused greater hemodynamic instability and was associated with a larger fluid resuscitation compared with those in whom less than 500 mL ascites was drained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Older studies estimated that the losses from open abdominal exposure were 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour;</span> however, the amount varies with the degree of organ exposure and the severity of the illness. Minimally invasive approaches are associated with less evaporative loss. Postoperatively, insensible losses can also occur through large open wounds, such as an open abdomen or burn wounds. </p><p>Insensible losses associated with ventilator support (intraoperative, postoperative) are limited. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2501608345\"><span class=\"h1\">FLUID RESUSCITATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluid replacement is needed in the postoperative period for one or more of the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incomplete replacement of preoperative fluid deficit or preoperative fasting-associated deficit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incomplete replacement of intraoperative sensible and insensible fluid losses.

Hypovolemia and anemia related to acute blood loss should be identified and treated. Oliguria must be interpreted with caution in patients with acute or chronic renal dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1112784206\"><span class=\"h2\">Estimate the fluid deficit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The postoperative patient should be assessed for adequacy of intraoperative fluid resuscitation in a stepwise fashion. Often, some or all of preoperative and intraoperative losses will have been replaced during surgery. However, some patients leave the operating room without completing their fluid resuscitation. </p><p>Preoperative fluid volume loss can be estimated by interviewing the patient or their proxy and inquiring about vomiting, diarrhea, high <span class=\"nowrap\">fever/sweating,</span> and bleeding. Other sensible and insensible losses should be estimated. (See <a href=\"#H945124557\" class=\"local\">'Fluid losses associated with surgery'</a> above.)</p><p>It is important to look at the operating room record to compare the preoperative estimated fluid volume loss and intraoperative blood loss with the volume of fluid and transfused blood (including autotransfusion) that were administered during the surgery.<strong> </strong>The difference between these is the fluid volume deficit, which should be replaced.</p><p>Blood loss may be difficult to estimate. Blood collected from the operating field through closed suction evacuation is often readily apparent and measureable; however, some of this blood may have been collected and returned to the patient using autotransfusion technology. The estimate of the volume of blood lost on surgical sponges may also be difficult since the amount of estimated blood varies with the sponge size and material and degree of sponge saturation (ie, volumes range from a few mL to 100 mL per saturated sponge). In addition, the amount on a sponge may be overestimated as blood may be mixed with ascites or urine. Conversely, blood loss can be underestimated, as blood may also be lost on surgical gowns, drapes, and the operating room floor. Occult blood loss will not have been accounted for. As an example, a significant retroperitoneal hematoma due to arterial cannulation may not be apparent until much later, as the patient develops symptoms (eg, pain, ileus) or becomes hypotensive.</p><p>In hypovolemic patients, it may not be possible to calculate the fluid deficit. It is a common practice to compare the physiologic parameters associated with hypovolemia as one would with hemorrhage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107655\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107655 \">table 1</a>). As an example, with &lt;15 percent circulating blood volume loss, the heart rate and blood pressure should be normal. If a patient demonstrates tachycardia or hypotension, it is likely that their volume deficit is greater than 15 percent. For a 70 kg individual, a 15 percent deficit would correspond to approximately 750 mL fluid deficit. While this method is not well supported with literature and is imprecise, it provides a good starting point.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1138385098\"><span class=\"h2\">Measure ongoing fluid losses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to replacing any postoperative fluid deficit, ongoing losses from drainage tubes will need to be accounted for and replaced. Provided the surgical drains are functioning properly, the volume of loss can be measured directly. We monitor drain output frequently; when it exceeds 400 mL in 8 hours (&gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour),</span> fluid replacement is initiated to minimize fluid deficits until the drain output subsides. Alternatively, we may begin replacing the output in a scheduled fashion (eg, 1 L every 12 hours), assuming the observed loss will continue at the same pace. These replacement protocols (hourly, every six hours, or intermittent bolus) can be revised several times a day, depending on the trend in output.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H340526809\"><span class=\"h2\">Volume of replacement fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the fluid deficit has been estimated and ongoing losses are measured, the total volume of replacement fluid can be determined. The postoperative patient can be expected to require a volume that is up to three times the estimated fluid deficit. As much as two-thirds of administered intravenous crystalloids are expected to shift out of the vascular space within hours of administration due to capillary leak, which correlates with the magnitude of the stress response to surgery. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with normal organ function, the fluid deficit is typically replaced in a ratio of 1:1, meaning that 1 L of fluid loss is replaced with 1 L of fluid replacement. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater amounts with ratios as high 3:1 may be necessary in those with a severe stress response to surgery. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower amounts (eg, 0.5 mL:1 mL) are used in those who are not expected to tolerate excessive fluid volume and in those who are expected to receive a large volume of other fluids, such as medications or blood products. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subsets of patients tolerate fluid replacement poorly because of their postoperative physiology. An example is the patient who undergoes pneumonectomy, whose remaining lung must acutely accommodate an entire blood volume. In such patients, smaller amounts of fluid are often used for replacement; at times, permissive oliguria is preferable to volume overload-associated pulmonary edema. </p><p/><p>Ongoing gastrointestinal or other losses are generally replaced with a volume equal to the loss. These losses can be replaced periodically (eg, every six hours). Alternatively, a fluid replacement protocol can be employed to keep up with losses on an hourly basis once a goal vascular volume is achieved. As an example, during kidney transplantation, the patient is volume-loaded during surgery until the intravascular system is replete. Thereafter, each hour after surgery, the amount of fluid lost is measured and replaced using an equal volume of intravenous fluid during the following hour. In this way, the intravascular volume is maintained and a fluid deficit is avoided. If large-volume losses are anticipated, the maintenance fluid goal rate can be increased temporarily. (See <a href=\"#H4160318265\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance fluid therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>For hemodynamically stable patients, ongoing fluid losses should be evaluated and adjusted daily; fluid needs should be assessed two or three times daily in critically-ill patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1784073192\"><span class=\"h2\">Replacement fluids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Crystalloids, blood products, and colloids are the replacement fluids typically administered to postoperative patients. It is important to consider the type and volume of fluid that was lost, which will help guide the choice of fluid, volume of fluid, and speed of fluid replacement. </p><p>Crystalloids remain the fluid of choice for simple fluid replacement following surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107900\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107900 \">table 3</a>). Although used intraoperatively, starch solutions are <strong>not</strong> commonly used in postoperative surgical patients for volume expansion as they may result in abnormal coagulation, which can contribute to bleeding complications. </p><p>Normal saline (ie, 0.9% sodium chloride; Na = 154 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> Lactated Ringer's solution (Na = 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> and Plasma-Lyte (Na = 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> are widely used because their sodium content maintains serum osmolarity, which helps retain water in the vascular space and facilitates volume expansion. The pH of Lactated Ringer's and normal saline is below physiologic pH, which also contributes to acid-base abnormalities. The lactate in Lactated Ringer's is converted to bicarbonate, which serves as a buffer, but its metabolism and clearance depend on adequate liver and kidney function. Plasma-Lyte contains acetate, a buffer, which is quickly converted to bicarbonate in most tissues, independent of the liver and kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Plasma-Lyte is more expensive than normal saline or Lactated Ringer's, which limits its use. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal saline (0.9%) is particularly useful in cases of chloride and volume loss as well as alkalosis (eg, vomiting). It contains the greatest concentration of sodium, repletes chloride loss, and will reverse contraction alkalosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal saline (0.9%) is used in association with blood transfusion, particularly rapid transfusion, because it does not contain additives like calcium, potassium, or magnesium. Lactated Ringers and Plasma-Lyte contain these additives, which may not be compatible with all blood products and can result in red blood cell lysis, clot formation in the tubing, and electrolyte chelation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal saline (0.9%) is used for head-injured patients, in whom hypernatremia is preferable to hyponatremia or lowering the serum osmolarity. The brain does not tolerate edema well; maintaining a normal (or elevated) sodium ensures that cerebral edema is minimized. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lactated Ringer's and Plasma-Lyte should be avoided in patients with hyperkalemia as they both contain potassium. Similarly, in patients with poor renal function, these choices are typically avoided in order to avoid hyperkalemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large volumes of normal saline are undesirable as they will result in hyperchloremic acidosis and renal vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. A restrictive approach to fluid resuscitation, using isotonic fluid, may reduce the incidence of renal sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In cases of renal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> liver dysfunction, a provider may have no other choice but to use 0.9% saline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with bicarbonate loss (eg, pancreatic fistula, bladder-drained pancreas transplant), bicarbonate replacement therapy may be administered intravenously in a continuous fashion. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sodium bicarbonate</a> is commonly added to replacement fluids in increments of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. The fluid vehicle is chosen to achieve the desired fluid sodium. For example, 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> of sodium bicarbonate will provide 150 mEq of sodium per liter, which is nearly equivalent to 0.9% saline (154 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span>. As such, it is mixed in sterile water or 5% dextrose in water to avoid further sodium administration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertonic saline (3% sodium chloride) is being used for the resuscitation of trauma patients whose abdomens are maintained open with a temporary abdominal closure device. In this highly selective population, volume overload results in delayed primary fascial abdominal closure and complications of open abdomen (eg, enteroatmospheric fistula). Inspired by a promising early report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], similar encouraging reports have suggested that the complications associated with hypertonic saline resuscitation (hyperchloremia, hypernatremia, hyperosmolar acidosis) are well tolerated in this patient population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Although this is not the standard of care, it remains a promising alternative to standard resuscitation and is supported by one systematic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p/><p>Colloid solutions can also be used for volume expansion. The main colloid used in postoperative patients is albumin, most commonly in the setting of severe malnutrition or liver failure. It may maintain oncotic pressure better than crystalloid. However, the effects of albumin are short-lived since it remains in the vascular space only for hours. The critical care literature suggests that there is no benefit to using albumin. A systematic review and meta-analysis from 1998 reported that albumin did not reduce mortality when compared with crystalloid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Later trials have also not demonstrated any benefit with respect to perioperative mortality with the use of albumin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Caution is advised with the use of large volumes of albumin; hyperoncotic albumin resuscitation was associated with increased risk of death in an international prospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Similarly, the use of albumin in neurologic injury is associated with increased mortality, likely due to the secondary increase in intracranial pressure that results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Other colloid solutions include gelatins, dextrans, and starches. The use of these agents in postoperative patients is very limited as their rheologic and anticoagulant effects are typically unwelcome. Similarly, they can incite anaphylactic reactions. In a Cochrane review of surgical and critically-ill patients, no colloid was found to be superior in efficacy or safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The best volume expanders in postoperative patients are blood products, particularly red blood cells and plasma. The risks associated with blood transfusion include transfusion-associated infection, lung injury, multiorgan failure, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Thus, transfusion is limited to patients with accepted indications such as those undergoing resuscitation for ongoing large-volume bleeding, symptomatic anemia related to acute blood loss, and reversal of coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia that places the patient at increased risk for postoperative hemorrhage. For large-volume blood loss, the American College of Surgeon (ACS) Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol mandates an initial two-liter rapid infusion of crystalloid followed by blood products. Although massive transfusion protocols vary widely in the United States, most trauma centers now use a balanced transfusion (1:1:1 ratio for plasma:platelets:red blood cells). In the Pragmatic Randomized Optimal Platelet and Plasma Ratios (PROPPR) study, a balanced transfusion was superior in achieving hemostasis and preventing death in trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of moderate to severe hemorrhage in the adult trauma patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive blood transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the absence of symptoms, an area of controversy regarding blood transfusion is the minimum hemoglobin threshold to achieve normal perfusion. Symptomatic anemia is defined by the anemic patient's subjective experience of symptoms of dizziness, lethargy, weakness, and muscle cramps during activity. Similarly, it may be defined objectively as syncope (witnessed loss of consciousness), tachycardia, hypotension, or tachypnea with activity in the setting of anemia. However, in some postoperative patients, it may be difficult to determine whether or not anemia is symptomatic because the stress response to surgery generates many of the same symptoms, as does volume depletion, sleep disruption, and poor enteral intake. In light of the risks of transfusion and in hopes of establishing objective transfusion goals that are safe, the critically-ill anemic patient population has been a group of intensely studied patients. Following publication of the Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) trial, a study of euvolemic critically-ill medical patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], restrictive transfusion protocols have gained popularity. Data on restrictive transfusion protocols specific to the surgical population are emerging. A hemoglobin goal of 7 to 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> is widely accepted for the <span class=\"nowrap\">trauma/critical</span> care population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>].

For higher rates (300 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute),</span> a pressure bag or Level 1 rapid infuser will be needed.

For patients who are not in shock, fluid replacement is achieved using successive 3.5 to 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> aliquots per hour. In general, for the average 70 kg adult, this corresponds to aliquots of 250 to 1000 mL for a total of 2 to 3 L until the desired response is observed (eg, improved urine output, improved mentation, normalizing base deficit). (See <a href=\"#H45343189\" class=\"local\">'Endpoints of fluid resuscitation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More volume-depleted patients will require larger aliquots.

In the setting of acute blood loss, more rapid transfusion may be needed to treat a patient in shock. Emergency rooms, trauma bays, intensive care units, and operating rooms have ready access to a rapid transfuser, which permits the rapid transfusion of warmed fluid and blood products at high rates (300 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute)</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-moderate-to-severe-hemorrhage-in-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of moderate to severe hemorrhage in the adult trauma patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45343189\"><span class=\"h2\">Endpoints of fluid resuscitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The endpoint of fluid resuscitation is to restore normal organ perfusion to permit sufficient oxygen carrying capacity, rather than simply the administration of a specific volume of fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Normal perfusion is achieved when the end-diastolic volume of the left ventricle generates an adequate stroke volume. To achieve normal organ perfusion, the blood volume must be restored to within 15 to 20 percent of normal blood volume, which is 5 to 6 L for a 70 kg adult. Although some clinical parameters and bedside examination may be helpful for assessing the adequacy of perfusion, laboratory measurements (ie, serum base deficit and serum lactic acid) and adequate intracardiac filling by echocardiography are better measures of adequate central volume. When normal organ perfusion is restored, replacement fluid therapy is complete. Approximately one-half of hemodynamically unstable patients will remain fluid responsive at the end of their initial resuscitation, further strengthening the argument to use endpoints of resuscitation other than only fluid responsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. If a patient becomes unresponsive to fluid replacement, it should be reconsidered to avoid complications of volume overload. </p><p>Since normal organ perfusion can be achieved without complete replacement of the estimated volume deficit for most patients, ongoing clinical assessment of the adequacy of organ perfusion is essential. In relatively healthy individuals who have not sustained large-volume blood or fluid loss, normalization of heart rate, blood pressure, urine output, and mental status mark the return of normal end-organ perfusion. A 45&deg; passive leg raise in a recumbent patient can be helpful for evaluating fluid responsiveness, which is defined as an increase in stroke volume by more than 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. For the average adult monitored with a noninvasive cardiac output monitor, a passive leg raise is equivalent to a fluid bolus of approximately 300 mL (4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span>. </p><p>Serum lactic acid, base deficit, and central venous oxygen saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>) are biochemical end-products of perfusion that are often used to confirm adequacy of end-organ perfusion in patients demonstrating complex physiology (eg, concurrent sepsis and hypovolemic shock). Trending values every six to eight hours is helpful. When a patient develops hypovolemia, impaired organ perfusion leads to anaerobic metabolism, which produces lactic acid. Lactic acid is buffered by base; it consumes the base, thereby creating a base deficit. Similarly, underperfused tissues will extract a greater percentage of oxygen than is normal, resulting in a decreased SvO<sub>2</sub>. As blood volume is restored, these parameters should trend toward normal. However, resolution of lactic acidosis is highly variable in its time course. Outcomes of surgical patients with lactic acidosis have not been as well studied as in the medical patient population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, lactic acidosis exceeding 4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> has been shown to be associated with increased mortality in emergency room patients with infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Serum lactic acid levels must be interpreted with caution in patients with liver dysfunction, who may not clear lactic acid as quickly compared with those who have normal liver function. Acute liver dysfunction can be observed in a variety of surgical settings (eg, sepsis, trauma, transplant). For patients with persistently elevated lactic acid and SvO<sub>2</sub>, in spite of adequate fluid resuscitation, further evaluation is warranted. </p><p>Estimates of central blood volume, including central venous pressure (CVP), the change in CVP (&#8710;CVP), and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) are not good estimates of central volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Several meta-analyses have demonstrated the lack of evidence to support their use as endpoints of resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. These are being abandoned in favor of goal-directed therapy, using biochemical markers (discussed in the preceding paragraph) or functional estimates of central volume using echocardiography (ecophysiology) to establish intracardiac hemodynamics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].

The goal of maintenance fluid therapy is to preserve blood volume and electrolyte balance and to provide some calories to prevent muscle wasting. Once resuscitation is completed, maintenance fluid therapy is begun.

For those with underlying organ dysfunction, daily maintenance volumes will need to be adjusted. </p><p>Restrictive fluid strategies may be helpful in avoiding overload in select patient populations. Emerging literature in the trauma population supports a more restrictive maintenance fluid volume in normotensive patients, which has been associated with fewer ventilator days and a shorter intensive care unit course, although this is not widely practiced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In such patients, the fluid goal is typically decreased by 50 to 75 percent, and, in some cases, permissive oliguria is accepted.

For the average 70 kg adult, 400 to 500 calories per day is sufficient to stimulate basal insulin secretion for the prevention of catabolism; this amounts to approximately 100 to 150 grams per day of dextrose. However, this effect is short-lived, and after five days muscle breakdown will occur unless supplemental nutritional support is instituted.
