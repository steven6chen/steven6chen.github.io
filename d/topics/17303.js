The skin might have lighter patches, darker patches, or both light and dark patches.</p><p>Tinea versicolor is caused by a fungus. This fungus lives on people's skin and does not cause problems normally. But in some people, the fungus can cause tinea versicolor. This happens more often in people who live where the weather is hot and humid.</p><p>Even though tinea versicolor is caused by fungus, it does <strong>not</strong> spread from one person to another. It is not &quot;contagious.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29905704\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of tinea versicolor?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tinea versicolor often appears as lots of small spots of color that seem to run into each other and form large patches. The colors can vary from white to light brown, dark brown, gray-black or pinkish red. There can also be a mix of colors.</p><p>Tinea versicolor usually shows up on the back, chest, or upper arms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F111505\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111505 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F111506\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111506 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82464\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82464 \">picture 3</a>). It can also happen on the face or in places where the skin rubs together, such as the armpit.</p><p>People often notice this problem more in the summer when affected areas of the skin stand out because they don't get tan from the sun.</p><p>Some people have mild itching with tinea versicolor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29905718\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for tinea versicolor?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. After learning about your symptoms and doing an exam, your doctor or nurse might scrape the surface of your skin and look at the scrapings under a microscope. This procedure is usually not painful. If you have tinea versicolor, the doctor or nurse will see the fungus that causes the condition in the scrapings from your skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29905733\"><span class=\"h1\">How is tinea versicolor treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most mild cases of tinea versicolor only need a special &quot;shampoo&quot; or cream. The shampoo is used like a soap on the affected skin.</p><p>If your tinea versicolor covers a large part of your body, or if it doesn't get better with the shampoo or cream, you might need medicine that comes in pills. Your doctor will decide if you need pills.</p><p>Even after you get treated, your skin might not go back to its normal color for several months. This does not mean the treatment didn't work. It just takes time for the skin to heal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29905748\"><span class=\"h1\">Can tinea versicolor be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the tinea versicolor keeps coming back, there are shampoos or medicines that can help prevent it. Your doctor will work with you on the best treatment plan for your situation.</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
