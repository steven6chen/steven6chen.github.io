Examples include sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, Huntington disease, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p><p>By contrast, complex disorders (complex traits) are those in which multiple genes play a role, often together with environmental factors. These include many complex disorders such as cardiovascular disease, asthma, diabetes, and cancer susceptibility.</p><p>This topic review discusses the inheritance patterns of monogenic traits, including classic Mendelian inheritance patterns as well as non-Mendelian patterns of inheritance such as mitochondrial inheritance and sex-linked expression, variable expressivity, variable penetrance, and other effects.</p><p>Complex (multigenic) disorders and an overview of the causes of genetic variation are discussed in detail separately.

However, even among these, not all inherited traits follow typical Mendelian inheritance patterns. Modifying effects by other genes, epigenetic changes, or environmental factors can obscure these patterns, resulting in inheritance patterns that appear to be &quot;non-Mendelian&quot;; these non-Mendelian patterns are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H3744740437\" class=\"local\">'Causes of non-Mendelian inheritance'</a> below.)</p><p>Gregor Mendel was an Augustinian monk and botanist who made observations from a large series of cross-breeding experiments of plants with varying flowering characteristics. Mendel noted that many physical characteristics of seeds and flowers were transmitted from parental strains to offspring in a predictable and reproducible manner. From these observations, Mendel proposed that traits manifest through the joint effects of two paired elements (later recognized as genes), with each parent contributing one element (allele) to each offspring at conception. He further discerned that two elements (genes) encoding characteristics that were co-inherited must be transmitted jointly, and, while many traits manifest in offspring as a blending (or averaging) of two distinct parental variations, there were also many examples where only one of the two parental variants was manifest in offspring, that is, where one trait was dominant to another.</p><p>He proposed the following laws of inheritance, published in 1866, based on his observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Law of segregation</strong> &ndash; The law of segregation states that paired parental copies of genes are separated from each other during gamete formation, with each parental copy (ie, allele) segregating into separate gametes. This process of gamete formation is now known as meiosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-molecular-genetics#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of molecular genetics&quot;, section on 'Meiosis and sustained genetic diversity'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Law of independent assortment</strong> &ndash; The law of independent assortment states that genes segregate into gametes independent of other genes such that the allelic status at one locus does not determine segregation of alleles at other loci. This is only true for genes that are not linked to each other.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Law of dominance</strong> &ndash; The law of dominance distinguishes dominant, recessive, and codominant traits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A trait is considered dominant when one allele is sufficient to confer the trait. Thus, dominant traits manifest in heterozygous carriers (heterozygotes).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A trait is considered recessive when it is observed only among individuals who carry disease-associated variants in both copies of a gene. Recessive traits are seen in homozygotes (individuals who carry the same disease allele in both copies of the gene) or in compound heterozygotes (individuals with two different disease-causing mutations, one in each copy of the gene). Heterozygotes for a recessive trait (carriers) are typically phenotypically indistinguishable from noncarrier (unaffected) homozygotes. In some recessive diseases, carrier status can confer increased risk for some disease features. In X-linked disorders, carrier females can sometimes be affected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A codominant or semidominant trait is one in which both alleles contribute equally to phenotypic expression. Heterozygotes manifest an intermediate phenotype between those of the two homozygous classes.</p><p/><p>These laws were translated to the clinical setting by Sir Archibald Garrod and published in 1902, launching the study of medical genetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A more detailed discussion of these principles is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-molecular-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of molecular genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The true genius of Mendel was that his postulates were put forward without any knowledge of their molecular basis. Demonstration of DNA as the heritable genetic material would only come decades later (DNA was identified in 1943 and the structure of the double helix elucidated in 1953).</p><p>It is important to stress that, although there is a molecular correlate to inheritance patterns, it is the trait (the phenotype or clinical presentation) rather than the genotype that segregates as dominant or recessive. Because humans are diploid, genes (genotypes) are inherited in a codominant fashion (equal contribution from each parent). Recognition of Mendelian inheritance requires obtaining a detailed family history and thorough review of pedigree information. Often a three-generation pedigree is required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-counseling-family-history-interpretation-and-risk-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic counseling: Family history interpretation and risk assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1177464532\"><span class=\"h1\">MENDELIAN INHERITANCE PATTERNS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3802853562\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview and definitions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mendelian inheritance refers to the collection of patterns of expression of traits over two or more generations in a family that follow the rules of parental-to-offspring transmission (autosomal or sex-linked, dominant or recessive) that Mendel first described (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78050\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78050 \">table 1</a>). These patterns are attributable to the actions of single genes. They are most clinically recognizable for rare, highly penetrant monogenic diseases.</p><p>A Mendelian trait is a clinical feature or attribute (eg, disease, phenotype) that follows a Mendelian pattern of inheritance. Traits conferred by mutations in one gene are called monogenic traits. Many rare genetic diseases follow such patterns and are thus called &quot;monogenic&quot; or &quot;Mendelian&quot; disorders. More than 10,000 Mendelian traits and disorders have been described. Many of these are cataloged in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database (<a href=\"http://omim.org/&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWEVgCk7IS97EvcRKgoDPvN8=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2897\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://omim.org/</a>), which includes a comprehensive listing of Mendelian and non-Mendelian traits and associated genes and is updated daily.</p><p>Five typical patterns of Mendelian inheritance include autosomal dominant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63306\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63306 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F110421\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110421 \">figure 2</a>), autosomal recessive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F50124\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50124 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F110582\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110582 \">figure 4</a>), X-linked dominant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75137\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75137 \">figure 5</a>), X-linked recessive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F55180\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55180 \">figure 6</a>), and Y-linked (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69653\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69653 \">figure 7</a>); their characteristics are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78050\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78050 \">table 1</a>). These patterns depend on two features: whether the trait is dominant or recessive and whether or not the trait is sex-linked. The distinction between X-linked dominant and X-linked recessive inheritance is considered by some to be an artificial division, and it has been suggested that the term X-linked inheritance can encompass both types of inheritance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Autosomal dominant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance is observed by dominant traits mapping to one of the autosomal (non-sex) chromosomes. As an autosomal trait, it manifests in both males and females equally and can be transmitted by either parent to approximately 50 percent of their offspring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F110421\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110421 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Because the causative mutations for autosomal dominant conditions are typically rare, most affected individuals are heterozygous for the mutated gene, with the other copy of the gene having typical, or wild-type, sequence. Many autosomal dominant mutations arise &quot;de novo,&quot; meaning that the genetic alteration occurs in the individual's genome rather than being inherited from either parent. However, affected individuals may also inherit the mutation from a heterozygous parent who is affected. According to the law of independent assortment, the heterozygous parent of an affected individual has a 50 percent chance of transmitting the mutation to subsequent children. The affected children in turn will transmit to 50 percent of their offspring (who will also be at risk of being affected). Offspring who are unaffected are not carriers and cannot pass the disorder to their children unless there is a new mutation.</p><p>Dominant traits are usually due to &quot;gain-of-function&quot; mutations, whereby the mutation confers a novel, deleterious gene function that cannot be overcome by the other normal functioning allele. Examples include Huntington disease (MIM#143100), familial Mediterranean fever (MIM#249100), and type I Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (MIM#118200).</p><p>Some dominant traits result from loss-of-function mutations, for which a 50 percent reduction in gene activity (haploinsufficiency) is sufficient to cause disease. Loss-of-function mutations can be dominant if the mutated gene not only interferes with its own function but also inhibits normal functioning of the normal allele (so-called &quot;dominant negative mutations&quot;). Aquoporin-2 mutations in autosomal dominant nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (MIM#125800) are an example of dominant negative alleles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Autosomal recessive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance is observed by recessive traits mapping to one of the autosomal (non-sex) chromosomes. As an autosomal trait, it manifests equally in both males and females, and deleterious alleles can be transmitted by either parent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F110582\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110582 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>An autosomal recessive disorder does not typically manifest in heterozygotes (ie, heterozygotes are typically unaffected carriers), and parents are almost always unaffected (with the rare exception of a consanguineous family that includes an affected individual and a heterozygous, unaffected partner). Examples of autosomal recessive traits include sickle cell anemia (MIM#603903), cystic fibrosis (MIM#219700), and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (MIM#107400).</p><p>Because two deleterious mutations are required to manifest disease, parents of affected individuals each must carry one copy of the mutation. Each heterozygous parent has a 50 percent likelihood of transmitting the mutation, so there is a 25 percent probability that an offspring will inherit two mutations. On average, 25 percent of an affected individual's siblings will be affected, 25 percent will harbor no mutations, and 50 percent will be carriers.</p><p>In some cases, the affected individual may be a compound heterozygote, having inherited two different mutations in the same gene on opposite alleles (also referred to as &quot;in trans&quot;). Though autosomal recessive disorders mandate two nonfunctioning gene copies, the causative variants observed in a given patient need not be the same. As an example, although 70 percent of individuals with cystic fibrosis are homozygous for the most common cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<em>CFTR</em>) mutation (Delta F508), the remaining 30 percent are compound heterozygotes for Delta F508 and one of the more than 1500 additional <em>CFTR</em> mutations that have been identified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to dominant pedigrees, there is typically no history of disease in prior generations. Due to the low prevalence of these mutations, there is often a history of consanguinity, whereby the carrier parents share a recent common ancestor from whom both inherited the rare mutation. The probability of being a carrier or having inherited the same, deleterious allele in such a family is a function of the degree of relatedness (ie, 1 in 2 for siblings, 1 in 8 for first cousins, 1 in 32 for second cousins) and is much higher than in the general population (in which it is usually much less than 5 percent).</p><p>Recessive traits usually result from loss-of-function mutations in proteins that can maintain normal physiologic homeostasis despite 50 percent reductions in activity. For example, hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP; MIM #274150) is caused by recessive mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene, a serine protease responsible for cleavage of von Willebrand factor (VWF). Carriers of causative mutations have a 50 percent reduction in protease activity yet do not manifest TTP, as the residual protease function is sufficient to metabolize VWF products and prevent microthrombi formation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-thrombotic-thrombocytopenic-purpura-ttp\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Sex-linked</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sex-linked inheritance describes traits that are inherited on either the X or Y chromosome.</p><p>X-linked traits can only be passed from fathers to daughters; they cannot be passed from fathers to sons (because fathers do not provide an X-chromosome to sons), although father to grandson transmission can occur via a daughter carrier. X-linked inheritance can be dominant or recessive; X-linked recessive inheritance is most common. Examples of X-linked recessive disorders are hemophilia A and hemophilia B. As noted above, some believe the distinction between X-linked recessive and X-linked dominant is an artificial distinction. (See <a href=\"#H3802853562\" class=\"local\">'Overview and definitions'</a> above.)</p><p>X-linked recessive disorders are recognized by the predominance of clinical manifestations in males since males carry only one X chromosome and are reliant on normal functioning of the genes carried on that chromosome.</p><p>Females typically only manifest the phenotype if they are homozygous (or compound heterozygous) for the mutation, which would only occur in the rare event that both the father and mother are carriers. However, due to X-chromosome inactivation in committed cell lineages, occasionally heterozygous females can manifest disease because of skewed X-inactivation. If X-inactivation is skewed such that the normal X chromosome (without the mutation) is disproportionately inactivated, the chromosome with the mutation will be preferentially active and the mutated gene will have greater expression compared with the unmutated gene, and phenotypic manifestations may be more severe than anticipated. This has been described in hemophilia and sideroblastic anemia.</p><p>One hundred percent of daughters of affected males with an X-linked recessive condition will be obligate carriers (due to mandatory X chromosome transmission from fathers to daughters). Maternal carriers will pass the mutation to 50 percent of offspring. Therefore, 50 percent of sons will be affected and 50 percent of daughters will be carriers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F55180\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55180 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p>X-linked dominant traits occur more commonly in females than do X-linked recessive traits. However, because heterozygote females have one normal X chromosome but affected males do not, X-linked dominant disease is often more severe in males. All daughters of affected males will be affected. Affected mothers will transmit to 50 percent of offspring, regardless of sex, resulting in 50 percent of their children being affected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75137\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75137 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p>Y-linked inheritance is easily recognized because it manifests as exclusive transmission from father to son; all affected individuals are male (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69653\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69653 \">figure 7</a>). Although several forms of male sexual dysfunction have been linked to mutations on the Y chromosome, there are no confirmed examples of other types of Y-linked diseases. This is intuitive since females are healthy despite lacking Y-chromosome genes. Y-linked disease is theoretically possible if a gain-of-function mutation occurred (for example, duplication of a Y-chromosome gene that caused &quot;overdosage&quot; of a gene product).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3744740437\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF NON-MENDELIAN INHERITANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many instances where familial clustering of rare traits is observed, but the patterns of inheritance within families appear to violate Mendel's laws. Inheritance can appear to be non-Mendelian because multiple genes impact the disease phenotype, or because, despite a disorder being monogenic, additional factors impact the concordance between genotype and phenotype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78050\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78050 \">table 1</a>). Phenomena that obscure Mendelian inheritance patterns can make genetic conditions more difficult to recognize.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1919293997\"><span class=\"h2\">Penetrance and expressivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Penetrance and expressivity are terms that describe how the disease genotype correlates with clinical phenotype. Alterations in penetrance or expressivity can make monogenic traits appear to be transmitted in a non-Mendelian pattern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1957209762\"><span class=\"h3\">Incomplete or variable penetrance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic disorders that demonstrate strong genotype-phenotype associations are described as &quot;highly penetrant,&quot; meaning that if the mutated gene is inherited, the phenotype is highly likely to be present. As a probability, penetrance can range from zero to one, with higher values denoting highly penetrant genes. For most disorders, complete penetrance is the exception and not the rule.</p><p>For monogenic traits, penetrance is defined as the proportion of individuals who carry the causative genotype and who manifest disease. Some diseases have very high (or full) penetrance, whereas others demonstrate more variable penetrance rates. Penetrance can also be used to describe alleles in the context of complex diseases, but other expressions of risk, such as odds ratio (OR), relative risk (RR), or population attributable risk (PAR), are more commonly used.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Full penetrance</strong> &ndash; Genes with penetrance values of one are considered to be fully penetrant. In these cases, the genotype status perfectly predicts the development of disease and can be reliably used for genetic counseling, although the genotype does not precisely predict the age of onset or severity. Classic examples include autosomal dominant Huntington disease, in which all individuals with the disease mutation (the presence of more than 41 CAG repeats of the huntingtin [<em>HTT</em>] gene) will eventually manifest the disease, or biallelic inheritance of the 1278insTATC frameshift mutation in the hexosaminidase A (<em>HEXA</em>) gene in autosomal recessive infantile Tay-Sachs disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carrier-screening-for-genetic-disease-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population#H43\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carrier screening for genetic disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population&quot;, section on 'Tay-Sachs disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Incomplete penetrance</strong> &ndash; Incomplete penetrance refers to penetrance values of less than one, in which the expression of disease is not observed among all individuals who carry the disease-associated genotype. When penetrance is incomplete but high (ie, values of 0.8 to 0.9), the disease will appear to be Mendelian but may occasionally appear to skip a generation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79882\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79882 \">figure 8</a>); this can be most obvious for autosomal dominant inheritance. When penetrance is low, Mendelian patterns are often very difficult to appreciate in the absence of large extended pedigrees.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Variable penetrance</strong> &ndash; Adding further complexity to the recognition of Mendelian traits, variable penetrance across populations or pedigrees refers to penetrance levels that change across ethnic groups or within families. For example, though the lifetime prevalence of developing breast cancer among female carriers of <em>BRCA1</em> mutations is typically estimated at 60 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], lower rates (&lt;40 percent) have been reported in selected families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Striking differences, not thought to be due to differences in mutation frequency, have been reported in the annual incidence of breast cancer in <em>BRCA1</em> mutation carriers between North America (72 percent) and Poland (49 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3091344985\"><span class=\"h3\">Variable expressivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to penetrance, which describes the probability that a disease will be present with a given genotype, variable expressivity refers to clinical or phenotypic differences in the degree of disease manifestation when the condition is present. Variability is the norm among genetic diseases and is particularly common for disorders that affect multiple organ systems. As an example, in cystic fibrosis, there is significant variability in the degree of pancreatic dysfunction and lung function decline among individuals who are homozygous for the deltaF508 <em>CFTR</em> mutation, even among siblings and twin pairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Variable expressivity differs from phenotypic pleiotropy, which refers to the association of variants in a single gene with clinical manifestations in multiple tissues or organs. (See <a href=\"#H3494046040\" class=\"local\">'Pleiotropy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H745844843\"><span class=\"h3\">Causes of incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several determinants of variable or incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity; some are better understood than others.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Age</strong> &ndash; Age is the most widely recognized modifier of penetrance, with increasing age frequently associated with increasing penetrance rates. This likely relates to the cumulative rates of cellular damage that occur as a consequence of mutations over time until a requisite disease-causing threshold is attained. Selected examples include <em>BRCA1</em> and breast cancer; <em>C9ORF72</em> and <em>SOD1</em> and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; and myocilin (<em>MYOC</em>) and primary open-angle glaucoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Allelic heterogeneity</strong> &ndash; Allelic heterogeneity (ie, the presence of multiple, different disease-causing sequence variants in a given gene) is a common cause of variable penetrance and variable expressivity. Not all mutations have the same phenotypic impact. Mutations that induce more deleterious changes in protein structure (ie, nonsense or frameshift mutations) or those affecting critical positions or structural motifs in the protein (eg, in highly conserved functional motifs) will typically induce more significant functional consequences than more milder forms of variation such as conservative nucleotide substitutions, or substitutions of amino acids of similar size, charge, and polarity. This phenomenon has been documented for many notable conditions, including <em>SOD1</em> mutations in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, <em>CFTR</em> mutations in cystic fibrosis, and several beta globin mutations in the beta thalassemias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. It is likely that this cause of complexity plays an important role in most genetic diseases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetic heterogeneity</strong> &ndash; In cases where mutations in more than one gene can cause the same disease, the penetrance and expressivity typically vary. As an example, the various subtypes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) Type I (A through E) are caused by mutations in four different genes (<em>PMP22</em> for types 1A and 1E, <em>MPZ</em> for type 1B, <em>LITAF</em> for type 1C, and <em>EGR2</em> for type 1D). Although the spectrum of manifestations is clinically indistinguishable for some forms of CMT (eg, types 1A and 1C), marked differences in age of onset, rate of progression, patterns of nerve involvement, and severity of conduction abnormalities are typically observed between other CMT types. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetic modifiers</strong> &ndash; Genetic modifiers are sequence variants, most commonly in a different gene, that alter the penetrance or expressivity of a disease-causing mutation but do not cause disease in the absence of the disease mutation. For example, the penetrance of <em>DFNB26</em> mutations causing autosomal recessive, nonsyndromic deafness is markedly reduced among carriers of a putative modifier on chromosome 1q24 (Deafness, Nonsyndromic Modifier 1 [<em>DFNM1</em>]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As another example, lung function in cystic fibrosis is highly variable, even among individuals with identical genotypes. Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies have identified several candidate modifier loci, including common variants in the <em>TGFB1</em> and <em>IFRD1</em> genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Environmental exposures</strong> &ndash; The effect of environmental exposures on the phenotype of genetic disease (both for monogenic and complex diseases) has been recognized since the early days of medical genetics. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (<em>PAH</em>) gene and results in cognitive deficits due to accumulation of phenylalanine in the brain. Restricting the dietary intake of phenylalanine prevents its accumulation in the central nervous system, enabling normal cognitive development in individuals who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for <em>PAH</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. This is an example of a predictable environmental modification through substrate manipulation in a metabolic pathway. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-phenylketonuria#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of phenylketonuria&quot;, section on 'Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Penetrance and expressivity can also be altered through less predictable, indirect means. As an example, exposure to cigarette smoke greatly increases the likelihood and severity of chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and emphysema among individuals who are homozygous for mutations in the <em>SERPINA1</em> gene that cause alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history-of-alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency#H544414719\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency&quot;, section on 'AAT genetics'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Environmental exposures can also phenocopy genetic diseases. As an example, an outbreak of porphyria cutanea tarda, often associated with mutations in the <em>UROD</em> heme synthetic gene, occurred after hexachlorobenzene contamination of wheat in Turkey. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H43991314\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Halogenated hydrocarbons'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3494046040\"><span class=\"h2\">Pleiotropy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pleiotropy refers to the ability of mutations in a single gene to produce more than one or multiple phenotypic effects, often in different tissues or organs. Pleiotropy is distinct from variable expressivity, which describes how two individuals with the same pathogenic mutation (or combination of mutations) can manifest different phenotypic effects or different degrees of disease expression despite identical genotypes.</p><p>An example is Marfan syndrome (MIM #154700), in which <em>FBN1 </em>mutations can cause cardiac manifestations (aortic dilatation and rupture), ocular manifestations (ectopia lentis and severe myopia), and connective tissue findings (joint hyperextensibility and arachnodactyly). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis of Marfan syndrome and related disorders&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p>Other examples of pleiotropy include the diversity of affected organ systems in Holt-Oram Syndrome (OMIM #142900), ataxia telangiectasia (OMIM #208900), and nail-patella syndrome (OMIM #161200).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3915024912\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticipation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anticipation describes the phenomenon in which successive generations display accelerated, earlier-onset, or more severe disease manifestations. Diseases typified by anticipation are often first recognized in the most severely affected offspring, with subsequent diagnoses of milder disease forms in parents or grandparents. Anticipation can manifest through several mechanisms, including environmental modification or accumulation of disease modifier genes.</p><p>A molecular correlate of anticipation is seen in diseases caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions, such as myotonic dystrophy (OMIM #160900), where the number of CAG repeats can increase with each generation, resulting in longer repeats that confer a more severe phenotype. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p>Another example is in the short telomere syndromes, in which telomeres can become shorter with successive generations, leading to a younger age of presentation in children compared with parents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dyskeratosis-congenita-and-other-short-telomere-syndromes#H2371487939\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dyskeratosis congenita and other short telomere syndromes&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53669611\"><span class=\"h2\">Mosaicism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mosaicism refers to the state of having two populations of genetically distinct cells in an individual who arose from a single fertilized egg. Mosaicism can arise by one of several mechanisms that typically occur in one cell of a developing blastocyst or embryo. Events that occur later during development affect a smaller proportion of cells and a more limited number of cell lineages. Thus, the later a pathogenic variant arises during embryogenesis, the smaller its potential phenotypic impact. Individuals with mosaicism can only transmit the genetic alteration to the next generation if it is present in the gametes. If an individual with mosaicism for a disease trait harbors the associated variant in the germline, the trait may present as a new finding in children who inherit the variant. In contrast to mosaicism, chimerism refers to the uncommon state of having two or more populations of genetically distinct cells due to fusion of two or more fertilized eggs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1457606458\"><span class=\"h2\">Parent-of-origin effects (imprinting)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The expression of some traits is highly dependent on whether the mutations are inherited from one parent or the other (ie, on whether they are parentally imprinted). Parental imprinting is thought to arise through epigenetic modification of DNA that takes place in the ova and sperm during gametogenesis (before fertilization). Genes that are inactivated (silenced) in the female line are said to be maternally imprinted (only the paternally derived allele is expressed and active); genes that are inactivated (silenced) in the male line are said to be paternally imprinted (only the maternally derived allele is expressed and active) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54712\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54712 \">figure 9</a>).</p><p>A well-characterized imprinted locus is the 15q11 gene cluster. Several diseases map to this region and exhibit parent-of-origin effects that are dependent on the imprinting pattern. Prader-Willi syndrome (OMIM #176270) results from deletions of paternally inherited genes in this cluster (eg, <em>SNRPN</em> and <em>NDN</em>). These genes are silenced when inherited from the mother, and disease phenotypes only manifest when deletions occur on paternally inherited chromosomes. By contrast, Angelman syndrome (OMIM #105830) can result from deletions of a set of adjacent maternally inherited genes that include <em>UBE3A</em>; these genes are silenced when paternally inherited, and similar deletions on paternally inherited chromosomes do not produce the disease phenotype. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22#H8964746\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microdeletion syndromes (chromosomes 12 to 22)&quot;, section on '15q11-13 paternal deletion syndrome (Prader-Willi syndrome)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-12-to-22#H86261867\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microdeletion syndromes (chromosomes 12 to 22)&quot;, section on '15q11-13 maternal deletion syndrome (Angelman syndrome)'</a>.)</p><p>Few confirmed examples of parental imprinting with direct clinical application besides the 15q11 region have been described. However, it is possible that such epigenetic processes will prove to be important disease modifiers. Databases of imprinted genes are available from the University of Otago in New Zealand (<a href=\"http://igc.otago.ac.nz/home.html&amp;token=xC1NCWw0xfTOIrOACWJqbBVfw0LZTcMVbGE3dR4eCukEndJXJCq/RF6k01xaIo4n&amp;TOPIC_ID=2897\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://igc.otago.ac.nz/home.html</a>) and Geneimprint (<a href=\"http://www.geneimprint.com/&amp;token=7+GJrCvx/pgnT2Hm8UDNmJPRnskZGJKUdG7qEFXTsp2To7+i87fqAlGQn8/n4mRb&amp;TOPIC_ID=2897\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.geneimprint.com/</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These include entries related to neuropsychiatric illnesses including alcoholism, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism; diabetes; and asthma. Unlike the 15q11 locus, most of the findings have not been replicated in multiple patient populations, and the extent to which imprinting influences other traits remains unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2780908354\"><span class=\"h2\">Mitochondrial inheritance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mitochondrial inheritance refers to traits that are due to genetic variation in the mitochondrial genome rather than the nuclear genome. Mitochondria are organelles present in most somatic cells; numerous mitochondria are present in the cytoplasm. Mitochondria possess a mitochondrial genome that is completely separate from the cell's nuclear genome. The mitochondrial genome contains 37 genes that encode proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, transfer RNAs, and ribosomal RNAs, all contained in a 16.6 kb circular DNA fragment that replicates autonomously (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73757\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73757 \">figure 10</a>).</p><p>The human mitochondrial genome is inherited exclusively through the maternal line (ie, from the egg), as spermatozoan mitochondria are not contributed during fertilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, genetic disorders caused by mutations in the mitochondrial genome exhibit exclusive maternal inheritance (although some individuals may be phenotypically unaffected) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73424\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73424 \">figure 11</a>). Offspring of affected fathers do not inherit these diseases.</p><p>Commonly, individuals with mitochondrial mutations exhibit heteroplasmy, in which each there is more than one type of mitochondria (normal or mutated) in every cell. Females with a mitochondrial mutation who exhibit heteroplasmy will pass on varying numbers of mutant or nonmutant mitochondria in their eggs, meaning that there can be substantial variation in the contribution of mutant mitochondrial DNA (and thus the likelihood of developing the disease and the disease severity) in each offspring.</p><p>A human mitochondrial genome database is available (<a href=\"http://www.mitomap.org/&amp;token=l79bgTJaoAltP1TadK9WICccZBzGMcYK/rdeGVW2Pvg=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2897\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.mitomap.org</a>); this lists mitochondrial genome variants confirmed as pathogenic by two or more laboratories. Examples include <em>MERRF</em> (myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers, OMIM #545000), <em>MELAS</em> (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke, OMIM #540000), and Leber optic atrophy (OMIM #535000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. All of these disorders manifest with prominent neurologic manifestations (a consequence of the high metabolic requirements of neuronal tissues) along with other disease-specific phenotypes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitochondrial-myopathies-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mitochondrial myopathies: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-pathophysiology-of-the-sideroblastic-anemias#H3648145734\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and pathophysiology of the sideroblastic anemias&quot;, section on 'Myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia variants (LARS2, MTATP6, NDUFB11, PUS1, or YARS2 mutation)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuropathies associated with hereditary disorders&quot;, section on 'Leber hereditary optic neuropathy'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to these conditions with confirmed mitochondrial inheritance, there are numerous reports of associations between more common mitochondrial variants and a wide range of neurologic and psychiatric disorders including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and bipolar disorder; metabolic disorders (eg, diabetes, exercise intolerance, obesity); common complex diseases such as nonsyndromic cancer; and lifespan. Most of these associations have not been consistently reproduced by independent groups and clinical utility has not been demonstrated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3066975863\"><span class=\"h2\">Sex-limited expression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The expression of some traits, regardless of their chromosomal location, can be restricted to one sex, likely due to critical physiologic, anatomic, or hormonal differences. Male pattern baldness, which can be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, is the most common sex-limited trait. Others include familial male precocious puberty caused by mutations in the <em>GNAS1 </em>gene and juvenile hypertrophy of the breast, which is limited to females.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2106305650\"><span class=\"h2\">Multigenic disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diseases or traits caused by the combined effects of more than one gene are referred to as multigenic or complex diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2338655311\"><span class=\"h3\">Digenic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Digenic inheritance refers to an inheritance pattern in which mutations at two distinct loci are required for a disease to manifest. Many of the diseases with reports of digenic inheritance exhibit classic autosomal recessive inheritance patterns. When digenic inheritance is observed, one of the two loci is usually the same gene as implicated in the autosomal recessive forms (though with different alleles). As an example, a digenic form of retinitis pigmentosa (RP; OMIM #268000) has been described (type 7), resulting from the combination of specific heterozygous mutations in both the <em>PRPH2</em> (also known as RDS) and <em>ROM1</em> genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Consistent with digenic inheritance, the presence of heterozygous <em>ROM1</em> mutations in the absence of <em>PRPH2 </em>mutations does not result in RP. It is also noteworthy that the spectrum of <em>PRPH2</em> mutations includes several mutations that cause autosomal dominant RP alone and others that cause macular dystrophy. Thus, the <em>PRPH2</em> is an example of a gene demonstrating allelic heterogeneity (a cause of variable penetrance and expressivity), digenic inheritance, and pleiotropy. (See <a href=\"#H745844843\" class=\"local\">'Causes of incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3494046040\" class=\"local\">'Pleiotropy'</a> above.)</p><p>Another example of digenic inheritance is Usher syndrome, characterized by congenital deafness, vestibular dysfunction, and early-onset RP. Though most commonly presenting as an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in <em>CDH23</em> and other genes, some patients have been described with only one <em>CDH23</em> mutation in combination with a second severe, deleterious mutation in <em>PCDH15</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Triallelic inheritance illustrates the effects of gene dosage and represents a bridge between monogenic and multifactorial traits.</p><p>An example is Bardet-Biedl syndrome (OMIM #209900), in which most affected individuals are homozygous or compound heterozygous for a disease-causing mutation, consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. However, families with Bardet-Biedl syndrome have been described in which three mutations in two genes segregate with the disease phenotype, and family members with two mutations are unaffected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].

An example of this has been reported in a family with short telomere syndrome, in which a severely affected brother was homozygous for a variant in the <em>TERT </em>gene of intermediate functional impact (p.Lys1050Asn) and was also a carrier for a third, deleterious variant in <em>TERC </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Mendelian inheritance characterizes highly penetrant monogenic diseases (Mendelian disorders), in which the correlation between genotype and phenotype is strong. These are often rare disorders. The inheritance pattern refers to the phenotype (the trait) rather than the genotype. Recognition of Mendelian inheritance requires a detailed family history and thorough review of pedigree information (often from a three-generation pedigree).
