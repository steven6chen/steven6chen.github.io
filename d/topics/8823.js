In most circumstances, emergency clinicians use rapid sequence intubation (RSI) to accomplish this task. RSI incorporates a rapidly acting sedative (ie, induction) agent, in addition to a neuromuscular blocking (ie, paralytic) agent, to create optimal intubating conditions. Selection of the sedative agent and dose most appropriate for the clinical scenario is an important component of RSI.</p><p>The pharmacology and selection of induction agents for use in emergency RSI outside of the operating theater will be reviewed here. The techniques and other medications used in the performance of RSI, as well as other aspects of airway management, are discussed separately.

RSI is the virtually simultaneous administration of a sedative and a neuromuscular blocking agent to render a patient rapidly unconscious and flaccid in order to facilitate emergency endotracheal intubation and to minimize the risk of aspiration. Multiple studies confirm the high-success rate of RSI using the combination of a sedative and a paralytic drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].

They provide amnesia, blunt sympathetic responses, and can improve intubating conditions.</p><p>When a paralytic agent is used for intubation without sedation, the patient may be fully aware of his or her environment, including pain, but unable to respond [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. In addition to its inhumanity, this circumstance allows for potentially adverse physiologic responses to airway manipulation, including tachycardia, hypertension, and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Sedative use prevents or minimizes these effects. Furthermore, clinicians can sometimes select an induction agent that both facilitates RSI and ameliorates the patient's underlying condition. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> can be used in severe asthma to reduce bronchospasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Use of sedatives may also improve the laryngoscopic view obtained during RSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/5,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12,13</a>]. During RSI, the clinician must perform laryngoscopy during the earliest phase of neuromuscular paralysis. Sedatives improve laryngoscopy in part by supplementing the yet incomplete relaxation provided by the paralytic. Even in the presence of a full neuromuscular blocking dose of a paralytic, the addition of a sedative improves intubating conditions during RSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Each of the major induction agents in common use is discussed below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64272\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64272 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Etomidate</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">General use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Etomidate</a> is an imidazole-derived, sedative-hypnotic agent that is frequently used for RSI. Etomidate acts directly on the gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) receptor complex, blocking neuroexcitation and producing anesthesia. For RSI, etomidate is given by intravenous push in a dose of 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> with a time to effect of 15 to 45 seconds and a duration of action of 3 to 12 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It is the most hemodynamically neutral of the sedative agents used for RSI, and does not stimulate histamine release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/15-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-21</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Etomidate</a> provides no analgesic effect, so it does not blunt the noxious stimulation of the upper airway during laryngoscopy and intubation. For patients in whom this is a concern (eg, patients with cardiovascular disease or elevated intracranial pressure), an opioid analgesic, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>, is often given during the pretreatment phase of RSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Etomidate causes a mild increase in airway resistance, but may be used in patients with bronchospasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Concerns with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a> include adrenal suppression, myoclonus, and evidence of regional cerebral excitation (determined by electroencephalogram) after intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/18,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,24,25</a>]. Myoclonus has been misidentified as seizure activity, leading to incorrect recommendations that etomidate be avoided in patients with seizure disorders. Myoclonus during RSI is brief and minimal, because of the concomitant administration of a paralytic agent, and of no clinical significance. Etomidate decreases cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic oxygen demand, while preserving cerebral perfusion pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

The evidence surrounding this issue is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-intravenous-induction-agents#H307136729\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Intravenous induction agents&quot;, section on 'Etomidate'</a>.) </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Etomidate</a> is a reversible inhibitor of 11-beta-hydroxylase, which converts 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71558\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71558 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adrenal-steroid-biosynthesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adrenal steroid biosynthesis&quot;</a>.) A single dose of etomidate causes a transient but measurable decrease in the level of circulating cortisol that occurs in response to the administration of exogenous ACTH, although cortisol levels do not fall below the normal physiologic range. This effect does not persist beyond 12 to 24 hours.</p><p>We recognize the critical importance of maintaining adequate blood pressure early in the treatment of sepsis and, pending more definitive studies, we believe that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a> is an acceptable induction agent for patients with severe sepsis. Etomidate has the advantages of hemodynamic stability, when compared with most other sedative or induction agents, and familiarity because of its widespread use for RSI outside the operating room. When intubating the critically ill patient with possible adrenal insufficiency, the clinician must weigh the theoretical risk of cortisol suppression against the hemodynamic instability that may be caused by alternative induction agents.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Etomidate</a> should <strong>NOT</strong> be used as an infusion or in repeated bolus doses for maintenance of sedation after intubation. Emergency clinicians should inform the physicians assuming care for the patient in the intensive care unit or operating suite if etomidate has been used for induction. If ACTH stimulation testing is being considered, clinicians should be aware that the results may be affected by prior administration of etomidate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some authors recommend the use of empiric glucocorticoids for the first 24 hours after a dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a> in patients with sepsis, but this approach lacks support from outcome studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. We suggest that patients with sepsis who receive etomidate for RSI also receive a single dose of glucocorticoid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> 100 mg IV) <strong>only</strong> if they manifest hypotension that is refractory to treatment with aggressive fluid resuscitation and a vasopressor. This approach is consistent with that used for patients who do not receive etomidate. A discussion of the role of glucocorticoids in septic shock is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-therapy-in-septic-shock\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid therapy in septic shock&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Benzodiazepines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benzodiazepines cause sedation and amnesia through their effects on the gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) receptor complex. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Midazolam</a> is the most rapidly acting benzodiazepine commonly used for RSI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. The induction dose for midazolam is 0.1 to 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV push, with a time to effect of approximately 30 to 60 seconds, and a duration of action of 15 to 30 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>Like all benzodiazepines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> does not provide analgesia but does possess anticonvulsant effects, making it an effective agent for RSI in patients with status epilepticus.</p><p>The routine induction dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> for RSI is 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span>. In this dose, midazolam causes moderate hypotension, with an average drop in mean arterial blood pressure in healthy patients of 10 to 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. This tendency to induce hypotension limits midazolam's usefulness in the setting of hypovolemia or shock. If midazolam must be used in such patients, we suggest a dose of 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> which will somewhat delay the speed of onset and decrease the depth of sedation achieved, but should not severely compromise intubating conditions. For patients in shock, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etomidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etomidate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketamine</a> because of their superior hemodynamic profiles.

It is thought to stimulate the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor at the GABA receptor complex, causing neuroinhibition and anesthesia. It excites opioid receptors within the insular cortex, putamen, and thalamus, producing analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

For those with access to these medications, a brief overview of their use is provided here. The ultrashort-acting barbiturates interact with the barbiturate component of the GABA receptor complex, causing profound amnesia and sedation. Thiopental sodium was the barbiturate most commonly used for RSI.

Barbiturates do not provide analgesia.</p><p>Thiopental suppresses neuronal activity, making it a useful induction agent in hemodynamically stable patients with conditions that can elevate intracranial pressure (ICP), including seizures, intracranial bleeding, or trauma. However, thiopental is a venodilator with negative cardiac inotropic effects, and can induce profound hypotension in the doses used for induction of anesthesia. Clinicians must exercise great care when using it in hemodynamically unstable patients or patients prone to hypotension, such as the elderly. For emergency RSI, a dose of 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> is used; a reduced dose of 2 or 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> is used in the setting of hemodynamic compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-agents-for-rapid-sequence-intubation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].
