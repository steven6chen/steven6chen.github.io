Mycoplasmas are ubiquitous and are the smallest bacteria that can survive alone in nature. <em>M. pneumoniae</em> causes a wide variety of clinical manifestations in children and adults, principally pneumonia.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of <em>M. pneumoniae</em> infection in children will be reviewed here. <em>M. pneumoniae</em> infection in adults, <em>Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Ureaplasma urealyticum</em> infections are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycoplasma-hominis-and-ureaplasma-urealyticum-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;mycoplasma&quot; is widely used to refer to any organism within the class Mollicutes, which is composed of five genera (<em>Mycoplasma</em>, <em>Ureaplasma</em>, <em>Acholeplasma</em>, <em>Anaeroplasma</em>, and <em>Asteroloplasma</em>). More than 120 named <em>Mycoplasma</em> species exist, and 13 <em>Mycoplasma</em> species, two <em>Acholeplasma</em> species, and one <em>Ureaplasma</em> species have been isolated from humans. However, only four species are well-established human pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>M. pneumoniae</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>M. hominis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>M. genitalium</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>U. urealyticum</p><p/><p>A subsequently described species, <em>Mycoplasma amphoriforme</em>, appears capable of causing relapsing pneumonia through person-to-person spread in both immunocompetent and patients with antibody deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p><em>M. pneumoniae</em> grows under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and can be isolated on media supplemented with serum. The organism is fastidious, and isolation is not commonly performed in clinical laboratories.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism by which mycoplasmas produce infection is becoming better understood. Pathogenic organisms for humans and animals possess specialized tip organelles that mediate their interactions with host cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This host-adapted survival is achieved by surface parasitism of target cells, the acquisition of essential biosynthetic precursors, and, in some cases, cell entry and intracellular survival. The organism most commonly exists in a filamentous form and has adherence proteins that attach to epithelial membranes with particular affinity for respiratory tract epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Once attached, <em>M. pneumoniae</em> produces hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, causing injury to epithelial cells and their associated cilia. However, many of the pathogenic features of infection with <em>M. pneumoniae</em> are believed to be immune-mediated rather than induced directly by the bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. An immune-mediated mechanism is supported by the finding that infants and young children infrequently develop clinical findings of pneumonia despite evidence of<em> M. pneumoniae</em> infection. In addition, the antibodies produced against the glycolipid antigens of <em>M. pneumoniae</em> may act as autoantibodies because they crossreact with human red cells and brain cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>M. pneumoniae</em> is transmitted from person to person by infected respiratory droplets during close contact. The incubation period after exposure averages three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Infection occurs most frequently during the fall and winter but may develop year-round [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Although the frequency of pneumonia caused by all respiratory pathogens decreases in children older than the age of five years, the relative importance of <em>M. pneumoniae</em> rises during the school years. <em>M. pneumoniae</em> accounts for approximately 20 percent of acute pneumonias in middle and high school students and up to 50 percent of cases in college students and military recruits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In 2015 population-based surveillance for community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization, <em>M. pneumoniae</em> was the sole pathogen detected (by polymerase chain reaction) in 8 percent of children (&lt;18 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. <em>M. pneumoniae</em> accounted for an increasing proportion of cases with increasing age (&lt;2 years: 2 percent; 2 to 4 years: 5 percent; 5 to 9 years: 16 percent; 10 to 17 years: 23 percent). The cumulative attack rate in families approaches 90 percent, and immunity is not long lasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many infections caused by <em>M. pneumoniae</em> are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. When present, the signs and symptoms vary according to the stage of illness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59329\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59329 \">figure 1</a>). The onset of the illness is gradual and usually is heralded by headache, malaise, and low-grade fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Chills are frequent, but rigors are rare. Patient complaints usually exceed objective findings because abnormalities on physical examination often are minimal.</p><p>Symptoms and signs caused by <em>M. pneumoniae</em> infection can be divided into those caused by respiratory tract disease and those caused by extrapulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. None of these manifestations are unique to <em>M. pneumoniae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory tract disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many more patients with respiratory infection caused by <em>M. pneumoniae</em> have a respiratory tract illness without pneumonia than have pneumonia. In one review, for example, 75 to 100 percent of infected patients had an intractable, nonproductive cough, while only 3 to 10 percent developed pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The cough caused by <em>M. pneumoniae</em> infection ranges from nonproductive to mildly productive. Wheezing and dyspnea also may occur, although dyspnea is not a common complaint. Chills are common, but rigors are very rare.</p><p>Additional respiratory symptoms include pharyngitis (6 to 59 percent of patients), rhinorrhea (2 to 40 percent), and ear pain (2 to 35 percent). As many as 5 percent of patients have severe ear pain resulting from hemorrhagic bullous myringitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], although one study using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based testing failed to document <em>M. pneumoniae</em> in bullous or hemorrhagic myringitis in children under the age of two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Clinically inapparent sinusitis may coexist with pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>There may be no findings on chest auscultation even if pneumonia is present early in the course of disease. However, scattered crackles, wheezes, or both may develop later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Other physical findings related to the respiratory tract may include sinus tenderness, mild erythema of the posterior pharynx, erythema, or occasionally bullae of the tympanic membrane, and nonprominent cervical adenopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Possible relation to asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>M. pneumoniae</em> infection may worsen asthma symptoms and can produce wheezing in children who do not have asthma. A separate question, for which there has been some experimental and clinical evidence, is whether <em>M. pneumoniae</em> might have some pathogenic role in asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>This issue was addressed in a prospective study of children hospitalized for severe asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 119 children with previously diagnosed asthma, acute <em>M. pneumoniae</em> infection was found in 20 percent and <em>Chlamydia</em> <em>pneumoniae</em> infection in 3.4 percent. The diagnosis of acute infection was made serologically from either an immunoglobulin M (IgM) response or at least a fourfold rise in immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers between the first and second samples.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 51 children with a first asthmatic attack, acute <em>M. pneumoniae</em> infection was found in 50 percent and <em>C. pneumoniae</em> infection in 8.3 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 152 controls with stable asthma or rhinitis, <em>M. pneumoniae</em> infection was present in 5.2 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At follow-up, the patients infected with <em>M. pneumoniae</em> or <em>C. pneumoniae</em> were more likely to have recurrent asthma than those without these infections. Among infected patients, recurrences tended to be rapid if the patient was not treated with a macrolide antibiotic.</p><p/><p>Further data are needed before routine testing for atypical organisms can be recommended in acute wheezing illnesses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-wheezing-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of wheezing in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A prospective study suggested that the immune response to <em>M. pneumoniae</em> was altered in children with asthma compared to controls without asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In this study, fewer of the asthmatic children had an IgG response to <em>M. pneumoniae</em> over the five-year period (3 of 82 versus 13 of 98 controls, p = 0.03). The number of patients positive for IgM antibody did not differ between the groups. Cellular immune responses in mononuclear cells were greater in those with measurable IgM than in children without IgM, whether or not they had asthma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Extrapulmonary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extrapulmonary abnormalities are an important part of mycoplasma disease and may suggest the diagnosis. These manifestations include hemolysis, skin rash, joint involvement, and symptoms and signs indicative of gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system (CNS), and heart disease. Whether the pathogenesis of some or all of these entities is caused by immune mechanisms or the direct action of the organisms is not clear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibodies (IgM) to the I antigen on erythrocyte membranes appear during the course of infection and produce a cold agglutinin response in approximately 60 percent of patients. Why mycoplasma infections promote the production of such antibodies and their significance in pathogenesis is not known. Although hemolysis may be severe, usually it is not clinically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Papular purpuric gloves and socks syndrome usually is associated with parvovirus B19 infection.

CNS involvement occurs most frequently in children and includes aseptic meningitis, meningoencephalitis (which may be complicated by postencephalitic epilepsy), peripheral neuropathy, transverse myelitis, cranial nerve palsies, and cerebellar ataxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/30-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-36</a>]. In a retrospective study of 365 children with <em>M. pneumoniae</em> detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or respiratory tract by PCR, 15.9 percent had acute neurologic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In 11.5 percent of cases, CNS disease was attributable to <em>M. pneumoniae</em>. In these patients, two distinct disease patterns were observed: one with a prodrome of &ge;7 days, respiratory manifestations, chest radiograph abnormalities, reactive IgM in acute serum, and detection of <em>M. pneumoniae</em> in the respiratory tract, but not the CSF; and one with a prodrome of &lt;7 days, fewer respiratory manifestations, nonreactive IgM response, and detection of <em>M. pneumoniae</em> in the CSF only. The pathogenesis of the CNS disease is uncertain. Possibilities include direct infection and an immune-mediated reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/29,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,36</a>].</p><p>Although uncommon, CNS involvement is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. One study evaluated 61 individuals with neurologic disease attributed to <em>M. pneumoniae</em> and found that five (8 percent) patients died and 14 (23 percent) had severe sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Another study reported adverse neurologic outcomes in 48.8 percent of children, but no deaths were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrointestinal symptoms range from nonspecific (common) to those of pancreatitis (rare); the latter disorder may be due in part to antibodies to <em>M. pneumoniae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Rheumatologic symptoms, including tender joints and muscles and a polyarthritis, can occur. Although arthralgias are common, actual arthritis is rare. Arthritis is believed to result from immune-mediated mechanisms; however, <em>M. pneumoniae</em> has been isolated from synovial fluid in some patients with polyarthritis, suggesting a possible role for direct infection.</p><p>Cardiac and renal involvement is unusual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Cardiac manifestations include rhythm disturbances, heart failure, chest pain, and conduction abnormalities on the electrocardiogram. Myocarditis rarely has been described in autopsy reports because the disease usually is not fatal. Clinically significant glomerulonephritis is a rare complication that is presumed to be secondary to immune complex deposition. In one case report, the glomerular disease correlated with high titer cold agglutinins, and the patient developed chronic renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Hilar adenopathy was noted in 34 percent of children in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The finding of hilar adenopathy in children with suspected <em>M. pneumoniae</em> infection should broaden the differential diagnosis to include tuberculosis.</p><p>Pleural effusions can be seen in as many as 20 percent of patients when lateral decubitus films are performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

In one study of 28 patients with documented <em>M. pneumoniae</em> infection who underwent both studies, air-space opacification was visible on chest radiography in 86 percent but was usually nonsegmental [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. By contrast, nodules and thickening of bronchovascular bundles were common HRCT findings (89 and 82 percent, respectively) and significantly less frequent findings on chest radiograph (50 and 18 percent, respectively).</p><p>Late structural abnormalities also can be identified on HRCT; a series of 38 children who had been hospitalized with <em>M. pneumoniae</em> pneumonia were scanned one to two years later and compared with 17 children who had not required hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Cold agglutinin titers are elevated in 50 percent of adult patients with mycoplasma disease, and the titer usually exceeds 1:128 in patients with pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Less well-studied in children, the accuracy of the cold agglutinin test in detecting upper respiratory infection caused by <em>M. pneumoniae</em> is not known, and specificity is low if the titer is less than 1:64 because a variety of other respiratory pathogens may induce an increase in cold agglutinins.</p><p>The peripheral white blood cell count is normal or slightly elevated with neutrophilia.

PCR had a sensitivity of 92 percent and a specificity of 98 percent (using a combination of serology and clinical data as the reference standard) and detected more cases of <em>M. pneumoniae</em> than did serology.

In a cross-sectional study of children (3 months to 16 years), the prevalence of anti-<em>M. pneumoniae</em> immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies and age-adjusted anti-<em>M. pneumoniae</em> immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies was similar among children with and without symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycoplasma-pneumoniae-infection-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

A major disadvantage of the CF test is that false positive results may occur, particularly during inflammatory reactions.</p><p>Enzyme immunoassay (EIA) techniques have largely replaced the complement fixation test because EIA is more readily available.
