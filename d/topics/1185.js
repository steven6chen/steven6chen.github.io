This usage is not accurate. Most febrile illnesses either resolve before a diagnosis can be made or develop distinguishing characteristics that lead to a diagnosis. FUO refers to a prolonged febrile illness without an established etiology despite intensive evaluation and diagnostic testing.</p><p>Large case series of FUO applying this definition have been collected over a number of decades; these facilitate an approach to patients with FUO and an understanding of the changing patterns of FUO with time and newer diagnostic techniques.</p><p>The definitions and special populations with FUO as well as the diagnostic approach to the adult with this problem are reviewed here. A specific discussion of the common and uncommon entities causing FUO and the approach to children with FUO is presented separately.

Expansion of the definition has also been suggested to include healthcare-associated, neutropenic, and HIV-associated fevers that may not be as prolonged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Establishing that a patient has an FUO</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the degree and duration of fever are not the only criteria for defining an FUO.

Since then, the fraction of FUOs that go undiagnosed has steadily increased (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73878\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73878 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/4,7,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,14-16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The early FUO series included few connective tissue diseases, illnesses whose characterization has benefited from careful clinical studies and developments in immunology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extrapulmonary tuberculosis, solid tumors, and abdominal abscesses are now less prevalent causes due to earlier diagnosis by radiologic imaging, particularly computed tomography.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exploratory laparotomy has given way to imaging and percutaneous-guided biopsies for diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infective endocarditis, which used to be a frequent cause of FUO, has become less common with improved techniques for the isolation of organisms. In the current era, when endocarditis appears as an FUO, it is more likely to be culture negative or caused by difficult-to-isolate organisms, such as <em>Bartonella quintana</em>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood cultures for the detection of bacteremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>True FUOs are uncommon. This was illustrated in a report from the Netherlands in which only 73 patients were identified between December 2003 and July 2005 at a 950-bed academic referral hospital and five community hospitals comprising 2800 hospital beds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The authors excluded immunocompromised patients, such as those with AIDS, hypogammaglobulinemia, granulocytopenia, and glucocorticoid therapy. The following distribution of causes was noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noninfectious inflammatory diseases (eg, vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyalgia rheumatica) &ndash; 22 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection &ndash; 16 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malignancy &ndash; 7 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Miscellaneous &ndash; 4 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No diagnosis &ndash; 51 percent</p><p/><p>Future advances in microbial diagnosis through gene amplification methods and clarification of the pathogenesis of connective tissue diseases will continue to change the distribution of FUO.</p><p>Practice advances have not always been helpful in diagnosing FUO. The frequent use of empiric antimicrobials, for example, can delay the diagnosis of some occult abscesses and infections and increases the number of drug fevers. Aggressive immunosuppressive regimens, lengthy intensive care unit admissions, and the increase in multiresistant organisms as resident hospital flora have all altered the types of infections encountered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Geography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infectious causes of prolonged fever in resource-limited countries include tuberculosis, typhoid, amebic liver abscesses, and AIDS. Ease of travel has the potential to bring back to the United States and other resource-rich countries more geographically restricted illnesses that may not be familiar to clinicians, such as malaria, brucellosis, kala azar, filariasis, schistosomiasis, African tick bite fever, relapsing fever, Q fever, dengue virus, chikungunya virus, Zika virus, or Lassa fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-fever-in-the-returning-traveler\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of fever in the returning traveler&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The classic geographic distribution of some United States zoonoses is also changing, owing to environmental changes such as incursion by humans into formerly unpopulated areas and global warming. Zoonoses like babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, and Lyme disease may present as FUOs in new ecologic niches.</p><p>Illnesses contracted abroad may have incubation periods that extend for months; some infections remain latent for years and may therefore present as fevers remote from the time of travel. Individuals traveling may also become infected with organisms to which local residents are not vulnerable because of preexisting immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Despite the wide variety of exotic diseases, the most common infections among series of FUOs have not changed over the century. These continue to include typhoid fever, tuberculosis, amebic abscesses, and malaria. Fever of unknown origin is more often caused by an atypical presentation of a common entity than by a rare disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Subpopulations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different entities figure in the etiology of FUO based upon features of the population being studied.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of FUO vary dramatically with age. In a series of 100 children with FUO, for example, one-third were self-limited undefined viral syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In contrast, multisystem diseases such as rheumatic diseases, vasculitis including giant cell arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and sarcoidosis accounted for 31 percent of cases in a review of patients with FUO over the age of 65 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Infections accounted for 25 percent and neoplasms 12 percent of cases in this report.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">AIDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of FUO in HIV-infected patients reflect the degree of immunosuppression, best measured by CD4 counts and viral load determinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In one series of 79 episodes of FUO among HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts ranging from 0 to <span class=\"nowrap\">790/microL</span> and a median of <span class=\"nowrap\">40/microL,</span> 79 percent were due to infections and 8 percent to malignancies; only 9 percent had no definite diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Over one-half were due to mycobacteria, two-thirds of which were atypical, most commonly <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex (MAC). Only lymphomas were highly represented among malignancies, particularly non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Disseminated Kaposi's sarcoma was relatively infrequent. A similar distribution was noted in another report of 59 HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>As with FUO in HIV-uninfected patients, the country in which the study is performed influences the prevalent etiologies detected. In one study from Spain, for example, 137 HIV-infected patients with fevers for at least 10 days and no diagnosis after 1 week in hospital underwent bone marrow biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The three most common diagnoses were mycobacterial infection (18 patients with <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> and 14 with MAC), non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and visceral leishmaniasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-and-rash-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever and rash in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Neutropenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neutropenia-associated febrile episodes without a source are most frequently linked to bacteremia. Fungal infections replace bacterial infections in prominence after the acute period (after seven days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Fever of unknown origin in this population is particularly confounding since it occurs in the context of a serious underlying condition that may itself cause fever. In addition, patients are often taking a number of medications (including antimicrobials), are receiving blood products, have varying degrees of immunosuppression, and, in transplant recipients, may experience allograft rejection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neutropenic fever syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fever, even if unexplained, usually abates with return of neutrophils. When fever persists or returns after the patient is no longer neutropenic, hepatosplenic candidiasis should be strongly considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-disseminated-candidiasis-hepatosplenic-candidiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic disseminated candidiasis (hepatosplenic candidiasis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most critical feature of the evaluation of a patient with FUO is to take a careful history and to reassess the patient frequently. It is important to look for uncommon presentations of common diseases and to perform a detailed physical examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history and physical examination, like laboratory tests, have the potential to generate valuable diagnostic clues in patients with FUO. The art of diagnosis is one of discrimination, as the clinician must determine which data to glean and which clues to pursue. In the series of 73 patients from the Netherlands cited above, the authors found an average of 10.5 potential diagnostic clues per patient through their careful history and physical examination and three per patient through laboratory testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Eighty-one percent of these clues were misleading.</p><p>A thorough history should include the following information:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Travel</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Animal exposure (eg, pets, occupational, living on a farm)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunosuppression (with the degree noted)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug and toxin history, including antimicrobials</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localizing symptoms</p><p/><p>Subtle findings may be elicited through a careful history. Examples include subtle changes in behavior or cognition consistent with granulomatous meningitis, jaw claudication consistent with giant cell arteritis; and nocturia consistent with prostatitis. Revisiting the history on several occasions may provide new clues in difficult cases.</p><p>The degree of fever, nature of the fever curve, apparent toxicity, and response to antipyretics has <strong>not</strong> been found to provide enough specificity to guide the diagnosis of FUO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Fever may be attenuated in older patients and moderated by use of steroids and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. However, the course of the fever curve may be helpful in determining whether the disease is escalating or waning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A wide variety of diagnostic tests may be useful in FUO. In addition to the evaluation to establish the presence of an FUO (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Establishing that a patient has an FUO'</a> above), we recommend the following minimum diagnostic evaluation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum lactate dehydrogenase</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tuberculin skin test</a> or interferon-gamma release assay (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-interferon-gamma-release-assays-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of interferon-gamma release assays for diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (tuberculosis screening) in adults&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV antibody assay and HIV viral load for patients at high risk (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-and-early-hiv-infection-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute and early HIV infection: Treatment&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three routine blood cultures drawn from different sites over a period of at least several hours without administering antibiotics, if not already performed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rheumatoid factor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Creatine phosphokinase</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heterophile antibody test in children and young adults</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antinuclear antibodies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum protein electrophoresis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT scan of chest</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Test performance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most of these tests, the false-positive rate, which can lead to unnecessary investigations, is similar to the rate of a helpful result. This was illustrated in the series cited above of 73 patients from the Netherlands seen between December 2003 and July 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest radiograph &ndash; Performed in 73 patients: helpful in 6 and false positive in 8 (8 and 11 percent, respectively)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest CT &ndash; Performed in 46 patients: helpful in 9 and false positive in 8 (20 and 17 percent, respectively)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal CT &ndash; Performed in 60 patients: helpful in 12 and false positive in 17 (20 and 28 percent, respectively)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positron emission tomography scan &ndash; Performed in 70 patients: helpful in 23 and false positive in 10 (33 and 14 percent, respectively)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute-phase reactants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most clinicians favor obtaining an ESR or CRP, despite their lack of specificity. One study reviewed ESR elevations above 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/h</span> among 263 patients with FUO: 58 percent had malignancy, most commonly lymphoma, myeloma, or metastatic colon or breast cancer, and 25 percent had infections such as endocarditis or inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or giant cell arteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Measurement of the ESR seems to have its greatest use in establishing a serious underlying cause of FUO, although drug hypersensitivity reactions, thrombophlebitis, and renal disease, particularly the nephrotic syndrome, may be accompanied by a very high ESR in the absence of infection or malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-phase-reactants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute phase reactants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A normal ESR or CRP also suggests that a significant inflammatory process, of whatever origin, is absent. Once again, however, there are exceptions. As an example, some patients with giant cell arteritis have a normal ESR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">CT scanning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT scanning of the abdomen has nearly replaced exploratory laparotomy and other radiographic tests in the search for occult abscesses or hematomas in patients with FUO. The finding of abdominal lymphadenopathy can be a clue to lymphoma or a granulomatous process. The usefulness of CT has resulted in this examination being used in nearly all patients with FUO. While magnetic resonance imaging scan can be more sensitive in certain settings (eg, the diagnosis of spinal epidural abscess), it is rarely required in the initial evaluation of FUO.</p><p>For similar reasons, CT scanning of the chest is invaluable in the identification of small nodules (indicative of fungal, mycobacterial, or nocardial infection or malignancy). The identification of hilar or mediastinal adenopathy may prompt biopsy by mediastinoscopy, providing a diagnosis of lymphoma, histoplasmosis, or sarcoidosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Nuclear medicine testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nuclear medicine testing is a more controversial area in the diagnosis of FUO. Both gallium-67&ndash; and indium-111&ndash;labeled leukocyte scanning are highly sensitive by virtue of including the whole body. Neither study, however, can pinpoint a diagnosis; as a result, they are nonspecific tests to localize a site for more specific evaluation such as with CT. When studied, the overall yield of gallium-67&ndash; or indium-111&ndash;labeled leukocyte scanning may be higher than with CT or ultrasound, since the latter tests focus on only a few parts of the body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. In one study of 145 cases of FUO, for example, 29 percent of the gallium-67 scans were helpful in establishing a diagnosis, versus 6 and 14 percent of ultrasound examinations and CT scans, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>A review of FUO in older adults found that gallium scanning had a diagnostic contribution in 17 of 47 cases, while 11 were thought to be false positives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This study recommended gallium scanning as the next step after routine laboratory tests, temporal artery biopsy, and abdominal ultrasonography in this population.</p><p>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) appears to be very sensitive in identifying anatomic sites of inflammation and malignancy. This modality may find a valuable place in the evaluation of FUO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>], but additional data from a controlled prospective study demonstrating efficacy are needed.</p><p>We recommend an abdominal and chest CT as part of the routine evaluation of FUO, reserving nuclear medicine imaging for cases in which the initial evaluation remains negative and a screening look at the entire body is desired. As noted above, however, the rate of false-positive tests with these modalities is similar to the rate of a positive result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The following examples include data from the Netherlands study of 73 patients cited above on the utility of biopsy of different sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver biopsy for possible miliary tuberculosis, granulomatous hepatitis, or other granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis &ndash; Liver biopsy was performed in 7 patients; it was helpful in 1 and false positive in 3.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymph node biopsy for possible malignancy, especially lymphoma, or infections such as cat-scratch disease &ndash; Lymph node biopsy was performed in 11 patients; it was helpful in 5 and false positive in 3.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Temporal artery to look for giant cell arteritis or biopsy of an affected tissue to diagnose a vasculitic process such as polyarteritis nodosa &ndash; Temporal artery biopsy was performed in 14 patients; it was helpful in 1 with no false positives.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pleural or pericardial biopsy in the evaluation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow biopsy was performed in 19 patients; it was helpful in 2 and false positive in 1.</p><p/><p>Two retrospective reviews of bone marrow biopsies to evaluate FUOs demonstrated high diagnostic yields and high prevalence of hematologic malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. The authors did not define the prevalence of infectious diseases at the hospitals under study nor did they define the decision-making that led physicians to request bone marrow biopsies. However, the observations in both studies were similar: lymphomas constituted &gt;40 percent of diagnoses, whereas infections were detected in &lt;15 percent of patients. Other causes of FUO included acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, sarcoidosis, systemic mastocytosis, and disseminated granulomatosis. In both studies, hematologic malignancies were strongly predicted by the presence of leukoerythroblastic changes in peripheral blood and a greatly elevated ferritin level (&gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL);</span> in one of the studies, hematologic malignancies were also predicted by the presence of splenomegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-fever-of-unknown-origin/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapeutic trials of antimicrobials or glucocorticoids, while tempting in the effort to &quot;do something,&quot; rarely establish a diagnosis. In addition, the diagnostic yield of blood cultures and cultures of biopsy material will be reduced following the initiation of antibiotics. Antimicrobial agents could be expected to suppress, but not cure, an infectious process such as an occult abscess since adjunctive drainage would usually be required.</p><p>Antibiotics can have effects on other infections than the ones to which therapy is directed. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rifampin</a>, for example, used in a therapeutic trial for tuberculosis may suppress staphylococcal osteomyelitis or diminish the ability to detect difficult-to-isolate organisms causing endocarditis. The appropriate duration of a therapeutic trial is also unclear since a number of infections such as endocarditis or pelvic inflammatory disease can take as much as one week for fever to abate, even with appropriate therapy. Thus, patients with FUO should not have empiric antibiotics started solely to treat fever.</p><p>A therapeutic trial of glucocorticoids for an inflammatory process should not replace relevant biopsies for steroid-responsive disease such as sarcoidosis, other granulomatous diseases, or vasculitis. A careful evaluation for infection should precede such a trial.</p><p>The rapid and marked decrease in temperature following a therapeutic trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> is said to distinguish the fever of malignancy, and especially lymphomas, from infectious causes. This finding is not specific enough to be useful for the individual patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1855301308\"><span class=\"h2\">Emergent FUO therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When morbid illnesses like endocarditis, temporal arteritis, central nervous system tuberculosis, and leptospirosis present as FUOs, they rarely progress rapidly enough to warrant emergent treatment. However, when illnesses like these are suspected, we speed diagnostic testing and treat empirically. Antipyretics improve patients' comfort, reducing headache, myalgias, arthralgias, and fatigue. In addition, they may also prevent delirium, particularly in older adults, and reduce exacerbations of chronic lung and heart disease. However, drugs with antipyretic effects may delay or obscure early symptoms and signs of specific diseases. Thus, we try to avoid prescribing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids.</p><p>The use of antipyretics is discussed in greater detail separately.

Among the 37 patients with no diagnosis who were followed for at least six months, 16 spontaneously recovered, 5 recovered with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or glucocorticoids, 15 had persistent fever, and 1 died.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever of unknown origin (FUO) is defined as fever higher than 38.3&ordm;C on several occasions lasting for at least three (some use two) weeks without an established etiology despite intensive evaluation and diagnostic testing.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important aspects of the evaluation of a patient with FUO are to take a careful history, perform a detailed physical examination, and to reassess the patient frequently. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'History and physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend the following minimum diagnostic evaluation: blood cultures, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein, serum lactate dehydrogenase, HIV antibody test and viral load, rheumatoid factor, heterophile antibody test, creatine phosphokinase, antinuclear antibodies, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> or interferon-gamma release assay, serum protein electrophoresis, and computed tomography scan of abdomen and chest. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary evaluation and diagnostic workup may suggest an appropriate site for biopsy that could establish the diagnosis.
