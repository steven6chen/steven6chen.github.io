Children are bitten more often than adults. The vast majority of animal bites are caused by dogs (85 to 90 percent), with the remainder caused by cats (5 to 10 percent) and rodents (2 to 3 percent).</p><p>The most feared complication of an animal bite is rabies, although skin infection is the most common complication. Some bite wounds can be serious, causing injury and permanent disability. Bite wounds to the hand carry an especially high risk for serious complications because the skin's surface is so close to the underlying bones and joints.</p><p>This topic review discusses recommendations for care after an animal bite. Prevention of rabies is discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Rabies (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF ANIMAL BITES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The location and type of the injury depends upon the animal inflicting the bite.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Dog bites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Victims of dog bites frequently know the dog that attacked them. Most dog bites occur in children, with the highest number seen in boys between the ages of five and nine years old. The head and neck are the most common site of bites in children up to age 10 years, probably because a child's head is close to the level of a large dog's mouth. The arms and legs, particularly the right hand, are the most frequent site of injury for older children and adults. A dog bite can lead to a range of injuries, including scratches, deep open cuts, puncture wounds, crush injuries, and tearing away of a body part. Dog bites rarely cause death.</p><p>Certain breeds of dog are more commonly associated with bites. German Shepherds, pit bull terriers, and mixed breeds account for the majority of dog bite injuries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cat bites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cats can cause wounds with their teeth or claws. Two-thirds of cat bites involve the upper extremities (arms and hands). Scratches typically occur on the upper extremities or face.</p><p>Deep puncture wounds are of particular concern because cats have long, slender, sharp teeth. When the hand is bitten, bacteria can get into the tissue that surrounds the bones or into a joint and result in osteomyelitis (infection of the bone) or septic arthritis (infection of the joint).</p><p>If infection occurs, it generally progresses rapidly, causing skin redness, swelling, and intense pain as quickly as 12 to 24 hours after the bite.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Rodent bites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rats cause the majority of rodent bites. Most bites occur at night on the face or hands in children five years old or younger. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Human bites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children are the most common victims of human bites, usually as a result of aggressive play with another child. Human bites can cause a semicircular or oval area of skin redness or bruising, and the skin may be punctured. Human bites are typically located on the face, upper extremities, or trunk (chest or abdomen).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Other types of bites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bites of most other animals, such as squirrels, rabbits, and guinea pigs, are generally treated the same way as cat bites.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1261188185\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSING FOR RABIES EXPOSURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anyone who is bitten by a raccoon, skunk, fox, coyote, or bat needs immediate medical attention, even if the bite is small and does not appear to be infected. These animals can be carriers of rabies, and post-bite rabies medications should be started as soon as possible. Because cats and dogs may also harbor rabies, all cat and dog bites should be reported to the animal control section of the local health department whenever possible. The cat or dog should be quarantined for 10 days and tested for rabies if concerning behavior develops. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Rabies (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ANIMAL BITE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After being bitten by an animal or human, it is important to quickly and carefully clean the wound thoroughly with soap and a large amount of water; this can help to prevent infection. If there is bleeding, a clean towel or gauze should be pressed to the wound to slow or stop the bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Do I need treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adults or children who have been bitten by an animal or human should see a healthcare provider if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An animal bite has broken through the skin and bleeding does not stop after applying pressure for 15 minutes </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bone may be broken, or if there is other serious injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bite victim has diabetes, liver disease, cancer, HIV-infection, or takes a medication that could weaken the immune system</p><p/><p>It is best to be evaluated and treated as soon as possible after being bitten to reduce the chance of developing an infection. This is particularly true if the bite occurs in developing countries where animal vaccination programs to prevent rabies are not prevalent.</p><p>People who do not meet the above criteria should watch their wound carefully for signs of infection (eg, worsening pain, redness, or warmth, fever, or pus-like discharge); if the bite is near a joint, the person should monitor for pain, swelling, and joint movement. Anyone whose wound appears to be worsening rather than improving should seek medical care. It is not necessary to be evaluated after a cat scratch from a house pet unless there are signs or symptoms of infection (worsening pain, warmth or redness, pus-like discharge, or fever). If the scratch originates from an unknown cat from the outdoors that attacked without provocation, medical advice should be sought regarding rabies risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Rabies (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common complication of an animal bite is infection. Antibiotics are generally recommended to prevent infection in people with high-risk wounds, such as deep puncture wounds, wounds involving a bone or joint, and for people with other health problems, such as a weakened immune system or diabetes, which could increase the risk of serious infection.</p><p>Many experts also recommend antibiotics for any person bitten by a cat because there is a high rate of infection from cat bites.</p><p>Antibiotics are usually given by mouth as a pill or liquid. If the wound becomes infected, some people will require intravenous antibiotics or a more prolonged course of oral antibiotics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Tetanus immunization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tetanus is a serious, potentially life-threatening infection that can be transmitted by an animal or human bite. Adults who are bitten should receive a tetanus vaccine (called a tetanus toxoid vaccine) if the most recent tetanus vaccine was greater than 5 years ago. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Adult vaccines (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Children should receive a tetanus vaccine in the following circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They have received less than three doses of vaccine. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The wound is clean and it has been greater than 10 years since the last dose of tetanus for clean minor wounds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The wound is dirty and it has been greater than five years ago </p><p/><p>In addition, if the wound is contaminated, tetanus immune globulin may be recommended if the person has had fewer than three tetanus vaccines or doesn&rsquo;t know. The immune globulin provides additional protection against tetanus infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Rabies immunization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who are bitten by an animal that could be infected with rabies MUST seek medical attention to determine if a series of injections is needed to prevent rabies, which is, for the most part, a fatal illness. This is discussed in detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Rabies (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Sutures (stitches)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some wounds can be sutured (stitched closed) within several hours of the injury, after the wound is thoroughly cleaned. Wounds to the face are usually closed immediately to avoid developing a scar.</p><p>However, due to the risk of infection, some bite wounds may not be sutured immediately. These wounds may be left open and sutured 72 hours after the injury. When wounds are left open, they are flushed with saline (a salt and water solution), left open to drain, covered with a dressing, and examined daily to look for signs of infection.</p><p>Immediate suturing may not be recommended for wounds at high risk of becoming infected, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crush injuries</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Puncture wounds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bites involving the hands</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dog bite wounds that occurred many hours earlier</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cat or human bites, except those to the face</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bite wounds in people who have a weakened immune system</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of an infected bite wound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regardless of initial management some people will end up with an infection in their wound. If this happens, the wound may need to be opened and have pus drained, and antibiotics may be required. People with an infected wound can be treated at home unless the person is not able to take care of their wound or if there is concern that the infection is worsening; in these cases, hospitalization is recommended.</p><p>People who are at risk for developing a wound infection should seek prompt medical attention even if there are no signs of redness (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Do I need treatment?'</a> above). For example, a person who has a deep puncture wound in their hand from a cat bite should seek medical attention immediately to prevent infection. Medical care usually consists of cleaning and dressing the wound and oral antibiotics that can be taken at home.</p><p>An x-ray may be done to ensure that there is no bone fracture and that tooth fragments are not buried in the wound. Infected bite wounds are not generally sutured immediately. Severe wound infections may require antibiotics given by intravenous injection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hospitalization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adults or children who have been bitten or scratched by an animal or human should see a healthcare provider in the following situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An animal has bitten and broken the skin and bleeding does not stop after applying pressure for 15 minutes, a bone may be broken, or there is other serious injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A dog or cat has bitten the hand, foot or head, or has bitten another area and caused a large wound. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bite victim has diabetes, liver disease, cancer, HIV infection, or takes any medications that could weaken the immune system.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are signs or symptoms of infection, including worsening pain, warmth or redness, pus-like discharge, or fever.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the bite victim had their last tetanus shot more than five years ago, or if they cannot remember when they received their last tetanus shot.
