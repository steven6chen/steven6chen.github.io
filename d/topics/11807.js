Symptoms result from involuntary muscle contractions, which are sudden in onset, usually affecting the calf or foot.</p><p>Nocturnal leg cramps are reviewed here. Other nighttime disorders of leg discomfort or movement, including restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS), are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7545418\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nocturnal leg cramps are common and frequently unreported to clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In the general population, they are present in 40 percent of those over the age of 50, have an increased frequency with age, show no gender preference, and are associated with sleep disturbance and overall poor health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Nocturnal leg cramps have been reported in about 7 percent of children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Peak occurrence in this population was at 16 to 18 years of age, with no cases reported less than eight years of age. Pediatric nocturnal leg cramps are typically benign, self-limited, and infrequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leg cramps can be idiopathic, which is most common, or secondary to other medical conditions. Secondary causes include structural disorders or leg positioning; neurologic disorders; metabolic disorders, including extracellular fluid volume depletion and electrolyte disturbances; and medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/6-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-17</a>]. Patients with the most common form of leg cramps have no fluid or electrolyte imbalance.</p><p>Observed electrophysiologic changes include an increased frequency of muscle action potentials due to motor neuron hyperactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This results in depletion of muscle adenosine triphosphate; cytosolic accumulation of calcium then prevents muscle relaxation. During polysomnographic studies, patients with chronic nocturnal leg cramps exhibit nonperiodic bursts of gastrocnemius electromyographic activity. Episodes occur during sleep without preceding physiologic changes. On electromyography (EMG), the involuntary contraction of the muscle is associated with repetitive firing of motor unit action potentials at much higher rates than those seen with voluntary muscle contraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. There is a gradual increase during the cramp in the number of motor units activated and their discharge frequency, which is followed by a gradual decrease and a pattern of irregular firing as the cramp resolves.</p><p>The secondary causes of leg cramps include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Structural/mechanical</span> causes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Structural disorders such as flat feet, genu recurvatum, and the hypermobility syndrome may predispose to leg cramps.

EAMC is thought to be associated with muscle fatigue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Peripheral vascular disease, venous insufficiency, and less common causes have been associated with nocturnal leg cramps, including anemia, Raynaud syndrome, opioid withdrawal, nonalcoholic cirrhosis, and bariatric surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/2,10,12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10,12,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7545463\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nocturnal leg cramps are characterized by sudden muscle tightness, most commonly in the calf, foot, or thigh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/16,17,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,22</a>]. The cramps typically last from seconds to many minutes, and are relieved by forceful stretching of the affected muscles. Calf cramping may be associated with extreme plantar flexion of the foot and toes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Following resolution of the acute cramp, there may be persistent soreness for up to several hours; discomfort for up to 48 to 72 hours has been described and may be more prolonged in the thigh compared with the calf and foot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/17,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,22</a>].</p><p>The leg cramps typically occur while in bed, but patients may be awake or asleep; the vast majority of individuals have such cramps only at night. In one study, cramps occurred exclusively at night in the majority (73 percent), but occurred both during the day and night in 20 percent of patients, and only during the daytime in 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The average duration of the cramps was reported as nine minutes.</p><p>The primary morbidity of the cramping is pain and sleep disturbance, and patients may present to their clinician with a complaint of insomnia. Daytime fatigue is sometimes reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Roughly 40 percent of those with nocturnal leg cramps report having such symptoms at least three times per week, and 5 to 10 percent report nightly cramping.</p><p>Striking seasonal variation in the occurrence of nocturnal leg cramps has been suggested by an analysis of the frequencies of new <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> prescriptions and of internet searches related to leg cramps, which both roughly doubled from their lows during the winter to highs during the summer over a six- and eight-year period, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Patients should be asked about symptoms that may suggest another cause of leg pain or similar symptoms, such as restless legs syndrome (RLS), dystonias, or peripheral vascular disease. (See <a href=\"#H7487632\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination &ndash; The physical examination should be directed towards identifying findings that may suggest an underlying cause or alternative diagnosis (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Causes and pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7487632\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below); cramps themselves will usually not be present at the time of the visit. The legs and feet should be examined by inspection and palpation of the affected areas, and peripheral pulses should be evaluated. A neurologic examination should be performed, including an assessment of strength, deep tendon reflexes, sensation (light touch and pinprick), gait, and the presence of a tremor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory evaluation is generally not needed to make the diagnosis of nocturnal leg cramps. However, laboratory testing may be indicated in selected patients, such as those in whom the medical history and physical examination suggests an underlying disorder or alternative diagnosis associated with cramps, patients with new onset of cramps, and those experiencing a significant or abrupt unexplained change in the pattern of cramps. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Causes and pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7487632\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The specific testing that should be obtained depends upon the suspected underlying or associated disorder; examples include potassium and sodium in patients receiving diuretics, serum iron and related testing in patients suspected of RLS or periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), electrolytes in patients on dialysis, and magnesium in pregnant women. Diffuse, recurrent, or severe muscle cramping should prompt an evaluation for hypocalcemia, although the plasma calcium concentration is normal in patients with idiopathic cramps. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypocalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypocalcemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7548673\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of nocturnal leg cramps is made based upon a characteristic history of leg cramps and a history and physical examination that clinically excludes another cause of muscle cramping (see <a href=\"#H7545463\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7548679\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7487632\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). The essential elements of the history for making the diagnosis are described in the diagnostic criteria of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, as detailed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Patients must meet all three of the following criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A painful sensation in the leg or foot associated with sudden, involuntary muscle hardness or tightness, indicating a strong muscle contraction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The painful muscle contractions occur during the time in bed, although they may arise from either wakefulness or sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pain is relieved by forceful stretching of the affected muscles, thus releasing the contraction.</p><p/><p>Typically, the muscle contractions occur in the calf, foot, or thigh, lasting from seconds to many minutes. Usually one muscle or part of one muscle is involved. Following the leg cramps, some patients have soreness and findings of tenderness in the affected muscle, which gradually resolve.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7487632\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may describe numerous types of leg pain as cramps. The physical examination may be helpful only in that it is usually normal with idiopathic leg cramps. A careful history and physical examination can exclude the majority of disorders in the differential diagnosis, including the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/8,9,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Restless legs syndrome</strong> &ndash; Restless legs syndrome (RLS) also occurs at rest, predominantly in the evening or at night, and is sometimes painful. Patients sometimes complain of a cramping sensation. Unlike nocturnal leg cramps, it is characterized by more continuous discomfort, a need to move the affected limb, and at times by involuntary brief movements. An important distinguishing feature is that RLS does not involve sustained contraction of muscles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Periodic limb movements</strong> &ndash; Periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS), also termed nocturnal myoclonus, are involuntary, jerking (lasting 0.5 to 10 seconds) movements of the legs during sleep that also occur at night but are not associated with the muscle tightening, pain, or necessity for stretching associated with leg cramps. Patients have stereotyped dorsiflexion of the toes and feet, sometimes with flexion of the knees and hips, occurring roughly every 10 to 30 seconds. When PLMS are associated with sleep fragmentation and excessive daytime sleepiness, they constitute periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD). A formal diagnosis of PLMD can be made by polysomnography. Individuals with RLS may also have periodic limb movements while awake, which are identical to those observed during sleep (and therefore quite distinct from leg cramps), but occur during periods of immobility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults#H69787559\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in adults&quot;, section on 'Periodic limb movements of sleep'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults#H1130980\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sleep starts and myoclonic jerks</strong> &ndash; Hypnic jerks, also termed benign hypnic myoclonus, are common sudden jerking contractures of the limbs that occur during the transition to, or very shortly after, falling asleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. These sleep starts may awaken the patient, and the severity of the movement can occasionally be frightening, but they are not associated with painful muscle cramps and seldom recur after falling back to sleep. No definite cause is known. Occasionally, sleep starts and RLS coexist. The condition is self-limited; treatment includes reassurance and avoidance of caffeinated beverages. Partial myoclonic jerks, which are usually multifocal and occur in distal muscles, may also occur during sleep or the sleep transition.

Decreased pulses and other signs of arteriosclerotic vascular disease may be present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peripheral neuropathy</strong> &ndash; Peripheral neuropathy is also associated with lower-extremity pain in some patients; it is usually characterized by dysesthesias <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> muscle weakness but not sustained muscle contractions. Neurologic examination that demonstrates abnormal sensory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> motor findings can distinguish these patients, who may occasionally experience cramps because of nerve injury or muscle pathology, from patients with nocturnal leg cramps without neuropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of lower extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dystonias</strong> &ndash; Dystonias, particularly focal dystonias affecting the feet, may resemble nocturnal leg cramps. Dystonias include occupational cramps, which may be thought of as focal dystonias (eg, cramps associated with playing of a musical instrument or writer's cramp) and dystonia of the muscles related to dopamine antagonists (eg, antipsychotic medications or antiemetics) or Parkinson's disease. Dystonias involve agonist and antagonist muscle co-contraction, unlike nocturnal leg cramps that are relieved by stretching, and can be distinguished from leg cramps electrophysiologically.

This widely recommended approach typically provides rapid relief of the acute cramp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/16,17,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,23</a>]. Some patients may also find relief from passive stretching by getting out of bed and standing with the foot flat on the floor then pressing downward firmly, although active dorsiflexion of the foot may be more effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In our experience, stretching of the affected muscle reduces the duration and severity of the cramping and subsequent discomfort.</p><p>Other measures that may offer relief from the acute cramp include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Walking or leg jiggling followed by leg elevation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hot shower with the stream directed at the cramp area of the body, usually for five minutes, or a warm tub bath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ice massage</p><p/><p>Patients with known abnormalities in fluid and electrolyte balance should undergo appropriate treatment for the correction of those abnormalities.

In patients in whom nonpharmacologic measures prove inadequate, pharmacotherapy may be tried with any of several different agents, but the data supporting the use of any one agent are very limited and inconclusive. We strongly prefer nonpharmacologic and alternative pharmacologic measures over the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a>, despite its potential efficacy and historical use for leg cramps, because of the risks associated with its use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74260137\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial preventive therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients who wish to prevent recurrent attacks, we suggest the initial use of daily stretching exercises or other nonpharmacologic, noninvasive interventions rather than pharmacotherapy.

The posterior leg muscles are stretched by leaning forward with the legs kept straight and the feet kept flat on the floor; the position is held for 10 to 20 seconds and stretches are repeated three to five times in succession, four times daily for the first week, then twice daily in the evening, and again before retiring thereafter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F70744\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70744 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Because of safety concerns, quinine is generally not available for prescription or over-the-counter use for leg cramps in the US; thus, the author prefers the use of 6 ounces (180 mL) of tonic water, rather than prescription quinine, and only if cramps have persisted or are severe and disabling. We use such treatment rarely and do not use it on a daily basis. In patients in whom the use of quinine or tonic water-containing quinine is under consideration, the patient should be informed of the potential adverse events and understand the level of risk relative to the relatively benign (although painful) nature of leg cramps.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Quinine</a> has been the best-studied drug for nocturnal leg cramps and has been found effective in some well-designed randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. The most common dose in the trials was 300 mg daily (range 200 to 500 mg daily).

However, quinine is no longer routinely recommended for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps due to the potential for serious <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> life-threatening side effects (eg, cardiac arrhythmias, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic uremic syndrome [HUS]-thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [TTP], and severe hypersensitivity reactions) that occur in 2 to 4 percent of patients, important drug interactions, and evidence for only modest benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-leg-cramps/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

The physical examination may be helpful only in that it is usually normal with idiopathic leg cramps. A careful history and physical examination can exclude the majority of disorders in the differential diagnosis, including restless legs syndrome (RLS) and other neurologic disorders, pain due to vascular insufficiency, and myalgia from various causes.

(See <a href=\"#H7548679\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an acute leg cramp should forcefully stretch the affected muscle, as an example by active dorsiflexion of the foot with the knee extended, when the cramp is in the calf. This widely recommended approach typically provides rapid relief of the acute cramp. Some patients may also find relief from other strategies, including passive stretching by getting out of bed and standing with the foot flat on the floor then pressing downward firmly, although active dorsiflexion of the foot may be more effective.
