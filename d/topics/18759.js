HPV and HIV interact in several ways that are relevant to VIN and VAIN:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HPV and HIV infection share a sexual route of transmission, and therefore, the vulnerable populations often coincide.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV-mediated immunosuppression results in exacerbation of HPV infection, and an increased incidence and severity of high-grade vulvar and vaginal lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-and-vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV infection appears to impair local mechanisms of lower genital tract immunity, as demonstrated by a decreased Langerhans cell density in vulvar tissue in HIV-infected women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-and-vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6220137\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination decreases the incidence of vulvar and vaginal neoplasia. This was demonstrated in a randomized trial of 5455 healthy women ages 16 to 24 years with no history of genital warts or abnormal cervical cytology who were assigned to receive the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18) or a placebo injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-and-vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. At an average of three-year follow-up, there were fewer cases of grade 2 or 3 VIN or VAIN in women in the vaccine group than in the placebo group (0.1 versus 0.2 percent); however, the trial did not have sufficient statistical power to assess whether the difference was significant (efficacy 62 percent, 95% CI &lt;0-89). At the start of the study, 13 to 14 percent of women tested positive for infection with one or more of the HPV types included in the vaccine. Excluding these women from the analysis did not alter the magnitude of the effect of vaccination; the rates of grade 2 or 3 VIN or VAIN for the vaccine and placebo groups were 0.04 versus 0.1 percent. Additional details of this trial are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-vaccination#H1040864741\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus vaccination&quot;, section on 'Efficacy'</a>.)</p><p>The safety or efficacy of the available HPV types 16 and 18 vaccine in preventing vulvar or vaginal neoplasia in HIV-infected women is unknown. It appears that it can be used in immunosuppressed patients, since it is not a live vaccine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-vaccination#H5968486\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus vaccination&quot;, section on 'Immunocompromised hosts'</a>.)</p><p>However, the vaccine may be less effective since the distribution of HPV subtypes in women with HIV infection is typically different from that seen in HIV-negative women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preinvasive and invasive cervical neoplasia in HIV-infected women&quot;, section on 'Future directions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus infections: Epidemiology and disease associations&quot;, section on 'Females'</a>.)</p><p>Given that HPV vaccination may offer some benefit to women with HIV infection and is not contraindicated in women with immunosuppression, we suggest HPV vaccination in HIV-infected women. Either the quadrivalent (HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18) or bivalent (HPV types 16 and 18) formulation can be used, but the quadrivalent vaccine offers the additional potential benefit of prevention of anogenital warts associated with HPV types 6 and 11, which can be extensive in immunosuppressed patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Condylomata acuminata (anogenital warts) in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Preexisting lower genital neoplasia is not a contraindication to HPV vaccination, since an individual may be infected with one but not all of the HPV subtypes included in the vaccine. Current HPV vaccines are for subtypes 16 and 18 or 16, 18, 6, and 11. The predominant HPV subtypes for vulvar cancer appear to be 16 and 33 and for vaginal cancer, 16 and 18 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vulvar-and-vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, other oncogenic subtypes may be present. There are few adverse effects of vaccination. The decision of whether to vaccinate a woman with established vulvar or vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia must be based on whether the cost justifies the limited benefit.</p><p>Type-specific testing for HPV 16 and 18 is not useful for identifying women who should not receive the vaccine, since HPV infection can be transient and it is not known if previous HPV infection is protective against reinfection.

Approximately 50 percent of women with VIN are asymptomatic. In symptomatic women, the most common complaint is vulvar pruritus; other presentations include perineal pain or burning, dysuria, a visible lesion, or a palpable abnormality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>VAIN is nearly always asymptomatic, but some women present with postcoital spotting or vaginal discharge.

Although HIV-infected women have an increased risk of these conditions, there are no data or guidelines regarding screening HIV-infected women for vulvar or vaginal cancer.</p><p>By contrast, the specific cervical cancer screening recommendations for HIV-infected women are that they undergo screening twice in the first year after diagnosis of HIV infection and then annually, provided the test results are normal.

We suggest that HIV-infected women undergo a careful vulvar and vaginal examination whenever a pelvic examination is performed for cervical cancer screening or for another indication (with the exception of focused examinations during which vulvar or vaginal examination for neoplasia would not be practical).</p><p>In our practice, we examine women who are immunosuppressed (CD4 cell count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;200/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> or have a viral load of &ge;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> at least every six months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VIN and VAIN are histologic diagnoses based upon vulvar or vaginal biopsy.

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that HIV-infected women undergo a careful vulvar and vaginal examination whenever a complete pelvic examination is performed (eg, for cervical cancer screening). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For HIV-infected women with abnormal cervical cytology in whom a cervical lesion is not identified, we suggest that vaginal cytology and colposcopy be performed. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VIN and VAIN are histologic diagnoses made using vulvar or vaginal biopsy. Biopsy may be directed by gross visual examination of lesions or by examination under magnification with a colposcope or hand-held magnifying device. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV-infected women with VIN or VAIN are treated the same as women in the general population. Conservative surgical excision and destruction of lesions are the mainstays of therapy. Topical therapy is reserved for patients with multifocal disease. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-intraepithelial-neoplasia#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-intraepithelial-neoplasia#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For HIV-infected women with VIN or VAIN, we suggest highly active antiretroviral therapy rather than no antiretroviral therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
