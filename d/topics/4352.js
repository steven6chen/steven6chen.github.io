Although many drugs are available for the symptomatic treatment of OA, the presence of comorbidities complicates management and remains a practical challenge. Both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions may require adaptation depending on the comorbidity.</p><p>This topic will review the management of OA in patients with common comorbidities. The pathogenesis and risk factors, diagnosis, clinical manifestations, and treatment of OA are presented separately.

In a retrospective cohort study in Canada with 207,610 patients over 30 years old, 67 percent of those with OA had at least one comorbidity which included hypertension (prevalence ratio [PR] 1.17, 95% CI 1.15-1.19), depression (PR 1.26, 95% CI 1.22-1.30), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11-1.21), and epilepsy (PR 1.27, 95% CI 1.13-1.13), even after adjustment for age and sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-that-impact-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There were insufficient data to calculate the prevalence of obesity and smoking, which were more commonly recorded among patients with OA than among those without. Diabetes is also a relatively common comorbidity among OA patients, with estimates of prevalence of approximately 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-that-impact-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Other studies have shown that the metabolic syndrome is more frequent in OA patients compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-that-impact-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among patients with OA is also high. A meta-analysis including over 32,000,000 OA patients found that they were twice as likely to have CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-that-impact-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Several studies have also suggested that OA is associated with excess mortality risk due to CVD, diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, cognitive disorders, and disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-that-impact-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis#H1338732285\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Mortality'</a>). In addition, pain secondary to OA may promote hypertension, obesity, and CVD by decreasing mobility (sometimes called the &ldquo;sitting disease&rdquo;).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1163198338\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS FOR COMORBIDITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of comorbidities in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) often impacts treatment choices, particularly with respect to pharmacologic therapy. Among these agents, the use of oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is often limited due to the increased risk of adverse effects in patients with common comorbidities. Otherwise, the same general management principles of OA should apply, in that all patients should also engage in nonpharmacologic measures such as weight management and exercise, braces, walking aids, and psychological interventions as appropriate. It is worth noting that the beneficial effects of exercise and weight loss are not only limited to OA but are also advantageous for several other comorbidities.</p><p>We discuss specific considerations when managing OA in the setting of the common comorbidities listed below. Our approach to managing OA patients with comorbidities is generally consistent with those that have been addressed by major guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-that-impact-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2740204918\"><span class=\"h2\">Diabetes mellitus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We avoid the use of oral NSAIDs when treating OA patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), particularly among those with complications such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> kidney disease. Adverse effects of NSAIDs among patients with kidney disease and CVD are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;COX-2 selective inhibitors: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other oral pharmacologic agents and supplements used in the treatment of OA appear to be safe, but few have been studied specifically in the context of DM. There are some data that support the safety of glucosamine among patients with DM. An analysis of safety data from one randomized trial found that the mean plasma glucose levels in the group of patients taking glucosamine did not differ from baseline at both the three- and six-month follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-that-impact-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Also, a subgroup analysis of hyperglycemic patients at baseline found that mean glucose levels tended to decrease over time with glucosamine compared with placebo. Additional information regarding the use of glucosamine and chondroitin for OA can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-knee-osteoarthritis#H2096440013\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of knee osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Glucosamine and chondroitin'</a>.)</p><p>Intraarticular glucocorticoid injections pose a theoretical risk to patients with DM by potentially raising blood glucose to hyperglycemic levels. However, patients generally experience an isolated increase in blood glucose for one to two days after the injection which rarely poses a significant clinical risk when DM is well controlled. For insulin-dependent diabetic patients in whom an intraarticular injection is warranted, self-monitoring of blood glucose should be performed for up to three to five days after the injection. In a case&ndash;crossover study of 40 patients with type 1 or 2 DM, the fasting blood glucose level was increased one and two days after a glucocorticoid injection for common conditions in the hand and wrist (eg, trigger finger, carpal tunnel syndrome, OA), especially in insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Fasting blood glucose concentration did not differ after the second post-injection day. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-that-impact-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In another study with 23 patients with DM, an extraarticular wrist injection of 10 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide increased blood glucose levels during five days after injection as compared with morning blood glucose levels pre-injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-that-impact-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Insulin-dependent patients experienced greater changes from baseline compared with non-insulin&ndash;dependent patients. Additional information regarding the use of intraarticular glucocorticoid injections in the management of knee OA is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis#H1879045343\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Intraarticular glucocorticoid injection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H722719391\"><span class=\"h2\">Poorly controlled hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We generally limit the use of oral NSAIDs in OA patients with hypertension to those whose hypertension is well controlled and who have preserved kidney function. All NSAIDs at therapeutic doses can increase blood pressure in both normotensive and hypertensive individuals. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor NSAIDs seem to have the more pro-hypertensive effects than nonselective NSAIDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-that-impact-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In a meta-analysis which measured the hypertensive effects of various nonselective NSAIDs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piroxicam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piroxicam</a> appeared to have a greater effect on increasing blood pressure relative to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulindac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulindac</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-that-impact-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. NSAID use may also reduce the effect of all antihypertensive drugs except calcium channel blockers. A detailed discussion of the effect of NSAIDs on blood pressure is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-and-acetaminophen-effects-on-blood-pressure-and-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs and acetaminophen: Effects on blood pressure and hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> is no longer a preferred agent in the management of OA, it is not contraindicated in OA patients with hypertension.

However, considering the known effects of systemic glucocorticoids on blood pressure, the blood pressure may be evaluated for the three to five days after the injection in patients with poorly controlled hypertension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H666209427\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with CVD, the use of both selective and nonselective NSAIDs should be avoided. For those patients in whom an NSAID is necessary, the choice is influenced by other factors which include the presence of other comorbidities and the cost to the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects#H10096834\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;, section on 'Patients with known coronary heart disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;COX-2 selective inhibitors: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;, section on 'Celecoxib'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-therapeutic-use-and-variability-of-response-in-adults#H975946476\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Therapeutic use and variability of response in adults&quot;, section on 'NSAID use and comorbidities'</a>.)</p><p>Regular NSAID use should also be avoided in patients taking low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for cardiovascular protection. In patients on aspirin who require NSAIDs on an occasional short-term basis, aspirin should be taken at least two hours before the NSAID.

Nonpharmacologic therapies including exercises, braces, education, and the use of assistive devices such as canes should be emphasized. Moreover, cardiovascular rehabilitation programs that increase physical activity have a positive impact on both CVD and OA. The benefits and risks of exercise in patients with CVD as well as an approach to prescribing exercise are discussed in detail separately.

However, when appropriate, other systemic therapies used in the treatment of OA such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a> can be used in patients with CVD.

There are conflicting data on the effect of acetaminophen on cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-that-impact-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. A large population-based study including 10,878 patients over the age of 65 who were exposed to acetaminophen during a 10-year period found that there was no associated increased risk of myocardial infarction or stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-that-impact-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. However, a systemic review which included four observational studies with data on adverse cardiovascular events found a dose-response increase with acetaminophen in the risk ratio of cardiovascular adverse events in each of the studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-that-impact-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Obesity also has a direct mechanical effect on weightbearing joints, as do various substances in adipose tissue such as adipokines or inflammatory proteins (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-osteoarthritis#H1444501306\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>). The approach to the management of obesity is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Weight loss has been shown to reduce both pain and disability in patients with knee OA. As an example, in a randomized trial with 399 overweight and obese knee OA patients, the association of diet-induced weight loss (&ge;10 percent) and physical exercise for 18 months was more effective on pain and mobility than each intervention alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-that-impact-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

There is also some evidence to suggest that weight loss may have a structural effect on OA. In a study with 112 obese patients, weight loss was associated with reduced medial-tibial cartilage volume (but not lateral and patella cartilage) and improved knee symptoms (pain, stiffness, and function) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comorbidities-that-impact-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2943564325\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIAL POPULATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3864378755\"><span class=\"h2\">Older age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In older adults with osteoarthritis (OA), optimizing drug therapy is more challenging.

(See <a href=\"#H1743140095\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1163198338\" class=\"local\">'Management considerations for comorbidities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We avoid the use of oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) when treating OA patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), particularly among those with complications such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> kidney disease. (See <a href=\"#H2740204918\" class=\"local\">'Diabetes mellitus'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;COX-2 selective inhibitors: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraarticular glucocorticoid injections pose a theoretical risk to patients with DM by potentially raising blood glucose to hyperglycemic levels. However, patients generally experience an isolated increase in blood glucose for one to two days after the injection, which rarely poses a significant clinical risk when DM is well controlled. For insulin-dependent diabetic patients in whom an intraarticular injection is warranted, self-monitoring of blood glucose should be performed for up to three to five days after the injection. (See <a href=\"#H2740204918\" class=\"local\">'Diabetes mellitus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We generally limit the use of oral NSAIDs in OA patients with hypertension to those whose hypertension is well controlled and who have preserved kidney function. (See <a href=\"#H722719391\" class=\"local\">'Poorly controlled hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with CVD, the use of both selective and nonselective NSAIDs should be avoided. For those patients in whom an NSAID is necessary, the choice is influenced by other factors which include the presence of other comorbidities and the cost to the patient. (See <a href=\"#H666209427\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular disease'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects#H10096834\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;, section on 'Patients with known coronary heart disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;COX-2 selective inhibitors: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;, section on 'Celecoxib'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-therapeutic-use-and-variability-of-response-in-adults#H975946476\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs: Therapeutic use and variability of response in adults&quot;, section on 'NSAID use and comorbidities'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We avoid the use of NSAIDs in the management of OA patients with chronic kidney disease, especially stages 3 and 4, given the risk of contributing to chronic kidney disease progression. (See <a href=\"#H3101813587\" class=\"local\">'Chronic kidney disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease or at elevated risk for gastroduodenal disease who require NSAIDs, we combine an NSAID with a gastroprotective agent (eg, a proton pump inhibitor). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity#H2134667089\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;, section on 'Nonselective NSAIDs'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-secondary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Secondary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The importance of weight loss should be emphasized for all OA patients who are overweight or obese. Obesity is associated with lower-limb and hand OA and can worsen pain and functional disability. (See <a href=\"#H3997438495\" class=\"local\">'Obesity'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-knee-osteoarthritis#H2301488914\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of knee osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Weight loss'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In older adults with OA, optimizing drug therapy is more challenging. Analgesics have pharmacokinetics characteristics different from those of younger patients and the risk of toxicity is increased. Pharmacologic agents for treating OA-related pain which may be more likely to result in adverse effects include NSAIDs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, and opioids.
