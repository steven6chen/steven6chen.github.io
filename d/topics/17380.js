Adenotonsillectomy is often thought of, and most often carried out, as a single, combined operation; however, in assessing indications for surgery, the two components require consideration individually. The two major categories of indications for tonsillectomy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adenoidectomy include obstruction and recurrent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-and-or-adenoidectomy-in-children-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The indications and contraindications for tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy are reviewed here.

The variation appears to be related to differences in the medical practice of general practitioners, pediatricians, and otolaryngologists in the management of recurrent tonsillitis and other conditions affecting the upper airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-and-or-adenoidectomy-in-children-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">Patient/family</span> factors and preferences may also influence the decision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-and-or-adenoidectomy-in-children-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In the United States, the number of tonsillectomies has declined progressively since the 1970s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-and-or-adenoidectomy-in-children-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Reports suggest that the decline has mainly involved tonsillectomies performed for infectious indications, while the number of tonsillectomies performed for obstructive indications has increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-and-or-adenoidectomy-in-children-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The estimated number of tonsillectomies (with or without adenoidectomy) performed in children &lt;15 years old declined from approximately 970,000 in 1965 to about 530,000 in 2006 and subsequently declined further to 289,000 in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-and-or-adenoidectomy-in-children-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/8,9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,12</a>].

Tonsillectomy alone is performed infrequently in children &lt;3 years old, whereas adenoidectomy alone is performed infrequently in individuals &gt;14 years old. The rate of adenoidectomy is about 1.5 times as high in boys as in girls, whereas the rate of tonsillectomy is about one-third higher in girls than in boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-and-or-adenoidectomy-in-children-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H695042471\"><span class=\"h2\">General considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two major categories of indications for tonsillectomy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adenoidectomy are obstruction and infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-and-or-adenoidectomy-in-children-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/1,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Obstruction</strong> &ndash; Obstruction may involve the nasopharyngeal airway, oropharyngeal airway, and the oropharyngeal deglutitory (swallowing) pathway. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infection</strong> &ndash; Recurrent or chronic infection may involve the middle ears, mastoid air cells, nose, nasopharynx, adenoids, paranasal sinuses, oropharynx, tonsils, peritonsillar tissues, and cervical lymph nodes.</p><p/><p>Most tonsil-related problems in children tend to decline naturally with increasing age, although not predictably.

By the same token, in a child scheduled for tonsillectomy for unequivocal indications, it would seem reasonable to add adenoidectomy if the child had had more than occasional bouts of otitis media, but had not undergone tympanostomy tube (TT) insertion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1830782742\"><span class=\"h2\">Tonsillectomy (with or without adenoidectomy)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H470716989\"><span class=\"h3\">Obstructive sleep apnea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in the pediatric population.

Surgical removal of the tonsils and adenoids is considered the first-line treatment for OSA in otherwise healthy children over two years of age with adenotonsillar hypertrophy, as recommended in guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-and-or-adenoidectomy-in-children-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/13,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,17</a>].

However, given the natural decline in tonsil-related problems with increasing age, another reasonable option is watchful waiting and the provision of symptomatic care and antimicrobial treatment (as indicated) for recurrent episodes. The decision should be made on a case-by-case basis after weighing the risks and benefits, and the values and preferences of the family and child. These recommendation options were incorporated in the 2011 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) guideline for tonsillectomy in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-and-or-adenoidectomy-in-children-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Third-year differences, although in most cases not statistically significant, also consistently favored the surgical groups.</p><p>However, in each follow-up year, many subjects in the nonsurgical groups had fewer than three episodes of throat infection, and most episodes among subjects in the nonsurgical groups were mild.</p><p>The results described above provide support both for surgical and for nonsurgical management of children with recurrent tonsillitis who are severely affected. Treatment decisions for such children are best made on a case-by-case basis.

The history standards were less stringent than those used in the earlier trials described above for severely affected children regarding either frequency, clinical features, or documentation of previous infections. The study included two parallel trials: one trial compared adenotonsillectomy with nonsurgical management in patients with coexisting indications for adenoidectomy (eg, recurrent otitis media); the other was a three-way comparison of tonsillectomy, adenotonsillectomy, and nonsurgical management in patients who lacked indications for adenoidectomy.</p><p>The following results were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-and-or-adenoidectomy-in-children-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the first year of follow-up, the mean number of moderate or severe episodes in the combined surgical groups (tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy) was 0.14 compared with 0.35 in the combined control groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During each of the three years of follow-up, the incidence of throat infection was significantly lower in the surgical groups than in the corresponding control groups.

However, the proportions of control subjects who developed no moderate or severe episodes of throat infection in a given year ranged from 70 to 84 percent (compared with 34 and 41 percent of control subjects in the first and second years of follow-up in the trials of severely affected children).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The outcomes in children who underwent adenotonsillectomy were not more favorable than those in children who underwent tonsillectomy only.</p><p/><p>Subsequent clinical trials and observational studies in mildly and moderately affected children found that compared with watchful waiting, tonsillectomy modestly reduces the number of throat infections, sore throat days, school absences, and clinic visits, mainly in the short-term (ie, &lt;12 months); however, there was little to no difference in these outcomes or in quality of life in the longer term (ie, two to three years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tonsillectomy-and-or-adenoidectomy-in-children-indications-and-contraindications/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].
