Since the magnitude of the neutrophil-mediated component of the inflammatory response may be muted in neutropenic patients, an elevated body temperature may be the earliest and only sign of infection. It is critical to recognize neutropenic fever early and to initiate empiric systemic antibacterial therapy promptly in order to avoid progression to a sepsis syndrome and possibly death. (See <a href=\"#H1169494774\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is crucial that there be an assessment of the risk of serious complications in patients with neutropenic fever, since this assessment will dictate the approach to therapy, including the need for inpatient admission, intravenous (IV) antibiotics, and prolonged hospitalization. Low-risk patients are those in whom the duration of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> is expected to be seven days or fewer and those with no comorbidities or evidence of significant hepatic or renal dysfunction.

Reactivation of herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus is also rare in low-risk patients.
