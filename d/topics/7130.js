FAB methods rely on the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The periodicity of fertility and infertility</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single ovulation each cycle</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The limited duration of viability of the ovum, which can only be fertilized 12 to 24 hours after release</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The limited duration of viability of sperm (three to five days in cervical mucus and the upper genital tract)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A woman's ability to monitor cycle length <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cycle-related symptoms and signs.</p><p/><p>These methods, also called &quot;natural family planning,&quot; involve identifying the fertile days of the menstrual cycle using a combination of cycle length and physical manifestations of ovulation (change in cervical secretions, basal body temperature) and then avoiding sexual intercourse or using barrier methods on those days. These methods can also be used in reverse to improve the chance of conception by couples attempting to conceive.</p><p>Surveys and behavioral research worldwide indicate that women who choose FAB methods do so because of their concerns about side effects and health consequences of other contraceptive methods. Religious constraints appear to play a small part in their method choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although many women have concerns about non-FAB methods of pregnancy prevention, most of these women have not embraced FAB methods. Only about 1 percent of women in the United States use FAB contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and 3.6 percent use it worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Possible explanations include lack of information, inconvenience, and concerns about efficacy (high typical user failure rate):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lack of information</strong> &mdash; The lack of readily available patient information on FAB methods is likely related to at least three factors: (1) the absence of a profitable product to advertise and sell, (2) provider concern that these methods are not as effective as other choices, and (3) the amount of time needed to counsel patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Studies including both physicians and nurse midwives have shown that relatively few providers routinely include information about FAB methods in their family planning discussions with patients. As an example, a survey of approximately 500 physicians in the United States found that one-third did not mention FAB methods to their patients at all, while 40 percent mentioned them only to selected women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. When asked by a patient for information about a FAB method, most physicians described either calendar rhythm or basal body temperature, which are among the least effective FAB methods (see <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Historical methods'</a> below). In another study, nurse-midwives offered little information about FAB methods based on their perception that these methods were not effective or were inappropriate for their patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Convenience</strong> &mdash; FAB methods can be labor-intensive for the clinician because of the time required for choosing the most appropriate method for an individual woman and for teaching her the method. These methods also require ongoing effort on the woman's part and impact spontaneity in sexual relations. Development of FAB methods that are relatively easy to incorporate into regular clinical services and use may increase interest and availability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy</strong> &mdash; Typical user failure rates are several-fold higher than correct use failure rates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70218\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70218 \">table 1</a>), similar to other user dependent methods of pregnancy prevention.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">IDENTIFYING THE FERTILE PERIOD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, FAB methods of pregnancy prevention are based on identifying the fertile days of the menstrual cycle and then avoiding sexual intercourse or using barrier methods on those days. Studies using sensitive pregnancy tests have established that a woman is fertile from five days before ovulation to the 24 hours after ovulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The probability of pregnancy from unprotected intercourse during this period is (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74756\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74756 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>4 percent five days before ovulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>25 to 28 percent two days preceding ovulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>8 to 10 percent during the 24 hours after ovulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>0 percent for the remainder of the cycle</p><p/><p>These probabilities are related to the limited viable lifespan of the sperm inside the woman's reproductive tract (not more than five days) and to the even more limited viable lifespan of the ovum following ovulation (less than 24 hours). As a result, the fertile window is no more than six days per cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Correctly timing ovulation is critical for determining when the six-day fertile window is likely to occur. Ovulation can be predicted using a combination of cycle length and physical manifestations of ovulation (change in cervical secretions, basal body temperature).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Determining ovulation by cycle length</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 95 percent of menstrual cycles, ovulation occurs in the four days before or after the mid-point of the cycle, and in approximately 30 percent of cycles, ovulation occurs at the exact mid-point of the cycle (eg, day 14 in a 28 day cycle, day 15 in a 30 day cycle) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66024\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66024 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>A computer model that applied the probability of ovulation on any given day and the probability of conception before and after ovulation calculated that the fertile period in women with menstrual cycles of 26 to 32 days was on days 8 through 19 (cycle day 1 is the first day of the menstrual period) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Determining ovulation by cervical secretions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abundant, clear, wet, stretchy cervical secretions occur immediately before, during, and immediately after ovulation, thus, the day of ovulation can be predicted by observing changes in vaginal discharge that occur over a typical 28-day menstrual cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The sequence of change is: menses; followed by no secretions for three to four days; followed by scant, cloudy, sticky secretions for three to five days; followed by abundant, clear, wet, stretchy secretions for the three to four days immediately before, during, and immediately after ovulation; and finally, no secretions for 11 to 14 days, at which time the next menstrual period begins. The duration of these phases varies by cycle length and in individual women.</p><p>The characteristics of cervical secretions during the menstrual cycle are affected by serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations. Before ovulation, estradiol produced by the developing follicle stimulates the production of cervical secretions that facilitate passage of sperm through the cervix and lead to functional maturation of sperm (capacitation) so that fertilization of the ovum is possible. Following ovulation, progesterone produced by the corpus luteum causes an abrupt change in secretions, which then inhibit sperm migration and capacitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Determining ovulation by basal body temperature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a normal menstrual cycle, basal body temperature (BBT) is approximately 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit (0.3 degrees Celsius) higher in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase. The temperature rise begins one or two days after the surge in luteinizing hormone and the rise in progesterone concentrations, and persists for at least 10 days. Temperature elevation identifies ovulation retrospectively and thus signifies the end, rather than the onset, of the fertile period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CANDIDATES FOR FERTILITY-AWARENESS BASED PREGNANCY PREVENTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H527656850\"><span class=\"h2\">Ideal candidates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential candidates for FAB methods are women who desire an alternative to other (barrier, intrauterine, hormonal or surgical) methods of family planning for health or personal reasons, are able to comply with FAB method requirements, and will abstain from sexual intercourse (or use barrier methods) on fertile days. The most appropriate candidates for FAB methods are women who can communicate with their partners, and whose partners are willing to support this method. </p><p>Variables to consider in counseling women about FAB methods are a woman&rsquo;s motivation to use the method consistently and her ability to use it correctly. Certain aspects of FAB methods may be unappealing to some individuals. As examples, the importance of the male partner's participation (eg, abstaining or using condoms during fertile days) and the need to be aware of one's body through daily assessment of cervical secretions (and possibly body temperature) might be problematic and inconvenient for some. However, some women may appreciate their male partner&rsquo;s involvement, and many find that learning about their bodies is a positive. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56707074\"><span class=\"h2\">Women in resource-limited settings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Global studies from resource-limited settings report that motivated patients who meet the criteria for FAB method use can successfully use a FAB method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The Standard Days Method and the TwoDay method were designed for women with limited resources because they don't require additional tools. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Standard Days Method'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'TwoDay method'</a> below.) However, women across all socioeconomic circumstances use these methods. </p><p>As with all fertility awareness methods, these two methods do require that the woman be able to communicate with her partner about her fertility status so they can modify their sexual behavior accordingly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Relative contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following physiological circumstances represent relative contraindications to use of FAB because of the difficulty in predicting ovulation during these periods.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recent menarche, childbirth, or discontinuation of some hormonal contraceptives</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approaching menopause</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Currently breastfeeding</p><p/><p>For example, just after menarche cycles are irregular so the Standard Days Method would be difficult to use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Similarly, breastfeeding women may have continuous cervical secretions that do not indicate ovulation and would find methods that require observation of cervical secretions difficult to use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, instructions have been developed for using the cervical mucus or ovulation method and the symptothermal method under these &quot;special circumstances.&quot; (Refer to The Art of Natural Family Planning Postpartum Guide and Premenopause Guide available from the Couple to Couple League at <a href=\"http://www.ccli.org/&amp;token=w8LauWtJpBMhpe2/t6zO0PInjRPrFOL1yne/m87nKpk=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5456\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.ccli.org</a>). A pilot study reported a fertility-awareness-based bridge for postpartum women to start with their first postpartum menses and until they are eligible to use the Standard Days method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">FERTILITY-AWARENESS BASED METHODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal FAB method is easy to use and minimizes the number of days that sexual intercourse must be avoided or practiced with a barrier contraceptive. Method requirements are also important since women with certain characteristics should avoid certain FAB methods.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Standard Days Method is not appropriate for women with cycles frequently shorter than 26 days or longer than 32 days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ovulation, TwoDay, and symptothermal methods are not appropriate for women unable to interpret their fertility signs correctly and women with persistent reproductive tract infections that affect their ability to interpret cervical secretions.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17529990\"><span class=\"h2\">Calendar methods</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Standard Days Method</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Standard Days Method (SDM) determines fertile days using two sets of probabilities: the probability of pregnancy with respect to ovulation and the probability of correctly timing ovulation with respect to the mid-point of the cycle.</p><p>It is the easiest FAB method to teach and use and has the fewest days requiring abstinence or barrier contraception. The only instruction is to avoid unprotected intercourse from day 8 through day 19 of the cycle (12 days); the user may have unprotected intercourse on all other days.</p><p>The SDM is appropriate for women whose menstrual cycles are usually between 26 and 32 days (approximately 78 percent of cycles are within this range) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, women with polycystic ovary syndrome, adolescents, breastfeeding women with amenorrhea, women who are recently postpartum, and women in the menopausal transition often are not good candidates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h4\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A clinical trial in which nearly 500 women were taught this method and followed prospectively for up to 13 cycles reported a pregnancy rate of &lt;5 per 100 women per year with correct use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The typical user pregnancy rate of the SDM was 12 per 100 women per year.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h4\">Counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in SDM counseling is assessing whether the method is appropriate for the individual woman. While it is not necessary for her to know her exact cycle length, a &quot;yes&quot; response to two questions: &quot;Do your periods usually come about one month apart?&quot; and &quot;Do your periods usually come when you expect them?&quot; is sufficient for this assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The figure provides guidance for initiating SDM use (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53914\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53914 \">table 2</a>). Women who know when their last period started can begin using the SDM immediately; those who do not know should wait until their next period begins. Women who were recently pregnant, breastfeeding, or using hormonal contraception should be asked about their recent and past menstrual history to determine whether SDM is appropriate for them and when to start it.</p><p>Women should monitor their cycle length while using SDM since some women have less regular cycles than they initially believed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The SDM is less effective in women with frequent cycles outside the 26- to 32 day range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Therefore, women who have two or more cycles longer than 32 days or shorter than 26 days in a 12-month period should be encouraged to use another method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Most women can learn to use the SDM in about 20 minutes. We suggest women use a visual tool such as CycleBeads&reg;, a string of 32 color-coded beads (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53853\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53853 \">figure 3</a>), or an iCycleBeads software application (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83607\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83607 \">figure 4</a>), in order to track their cycle days, visually indicate their fertile days (days 8 to 19), and monitor cycle lengths to be sure they are between 26 and 32 days. Several studies have confirmed that CycleBeads is a critical component of teaching and correctly using the SDM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. CycleBeads is available through some family planning clinics and retailers; CycleBeads, as well as the iCycleBeads Online web service and iCycleBeads software applications (for iPhone and Android devices), are available through <a href=\"http://www.cyclebeads.com/&amp;token=rmyIIiJb7iYATTgT+OW88JPadfhH49uGNWbQkTnHgR0ap/xWURxqTRTBvmVRbnqU&amp;TOPIC_ID=5456\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.cyclebeads.com</a>.</p><p>To use CycleBeads or the iCycleBeads software applications, a woman must track the first day of her period each cycle. The tools include a marker which helps her track her cycle day and whether she is fertile that day. Users are counseled to avoid unprotected intercourse when the rubber ring is on a white bead, representing fertile days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical mucus or ovulation method</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cervical mucus or ovulation method requires women to evaluate their cervical secretions several times each day to decide whether the day is a potentially fertile day, thus it takes more time to teach and learn than other methods. Unprotected intercourse is avoided on potentially fertile days plus some additional days as specified by method rules (see below). As a result, cervical mucus method users need to avoid unprotected intercourse for about 14 to 17 days each cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Examples of cervical mucus methods are the Billings Ovulation, Creighton Model, and TwoDay methods. Cervical mucus can also be assessed using a variety of devices. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Methods using mini-microscopes, computers, and other devices (eg, Marquette)'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17530359\"><span class=\"h3\">Billings and Creighton methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Billings Ovulation method is the oldest method of observing cervical secretions for fertility awareness. A variant on the Billings Ovulation method, the Creighton Model, requires that the woman score the secretions according to a multi-characteristic scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h4\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous studies of the efficacy of cervical mucus or ovulation methods have been conducted. A large well-designed study conducted by the World Health Organization in the early 1980s included 725 women from five countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The correct use failure rate was 3 per 100 women per year, and the typical user failure rate was 23 per 100 women per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The large difference between correct and typical use reflects the complexity of learning and using the method correctly, as well as the choice of some couples to have unprotected intercourse on fertile days. One study of a streamlined patient counseling program reported an even lower typical use failure rate of 15.9 per 100 users at 21 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h4\">Counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women require several instructional sessions to recognize the pattern of secretions in a typical menstrual cycle. In these sessions, they learn to observe, record, and interpret their cervical secretions, paying particular attention to the color, elasticity, abundance, and viscosity.</p><p>Learning to observe secretions at the vulva and evaluate them is critical for using this method. Women are encouraged to make these observations several times each day, preferably prior to each urination. Techniques include touching the vulva with the fingers or toilet paper to collect secretions and assess their characteristics, noting secretions on underwear, and simply &quot;feeling&quot; wetness at the vulva.</p><p>Various approaches to recording observations have been developed to help women become familiar with their fertile patterns over time. Commonly, women use a chart on which they mark days of menses, days with secretions (including characteristics of secretions), and days when pregnancy is likely. Cervical mucus method users are counseled to avoid unprotected intercourse:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During menses (because of the possibility that menstrual bleeding could obscure the presence of secretions, particularly in short cycles)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On preovulatory days following days with intercourse (even if there are no secretions present, because of the possible confusion with semen)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On all days with wet, slippery, transparent, or stretchy secretions consistent with ovulation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Until four days past the last day with wet secretions</p><p/><p>Based on these rules, the user avoids unprotected intercourse for approximately 14 to 17 days of each cycle.</p><p>An example of patient record is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64637\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64637 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">TwoDay method</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The TwoDay Method is based on assessment of cervical secretions, similar to the method described above, but it is less cumbersome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The principal difference is that, for the TwoDay Method, the mere presence or absence of cervical secretions is considered sufficient to determine the fertile period. TwoDay method users are counseled to avoid unprotected intercourse on all days that they note the presence of secretions and on the first day following a day with secretions. The presence of secretions conforms sufficiently to the actual fertile window so that further evaluation of the secretions' characteristics is not necessary.</p><p>An analysis of almost 4000 cycles in women using the TwoDay Method found that the mean length of the identified fertile period was 13 days, thus users needed to avoid unprotected intercourse for about 13 days of each cycle (range 10 to 14) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h4\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A prospective, multi-site efficacy study of the TwoDay Method followed 450 women for up to 13 cycles of use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The first-year correct use pregnancy rate was 3.5 per 100 women per year, and the typical use pregnancy rate was &lt;14 per 100 women per year. The lower typical use failure rate of the TwoDay Method compared to the cervical mucus or ovulation method is probably due to its simplicity. Women may find it easier to learn and use, and thus are more likely to use it correctly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h4\">Counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women can learn to use the TwoDay Method in a single counseling session when they present for family planning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. They learn what to expect in terms of presence and absence of secretions in a typical menstrual cycle: no secretions immediately following menses, secretions (of various types) beginning a few days after menses and continuing for several days, and absence of secretions again until after the next menses.</p><p>TwoDay Method users monitor the presence or absence of secretions and then ask themselves two questions: &quot;Did I have any secretions today?&quot; and &quot;Did I have any secretions yesterday?&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51450\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51450 \">algorithm 1</a>). If any secretions were noted today or yesterday, today is a potentially fertile day and she should avoid unprotected intercourse. If she did not notice any secretions today or yesterday (ie, two consecutive days with no secretions), her probability of conceiving today is very low and unprotected intercourse is permitted.</p><p>Learning to recognize whether or not they have secretions at the vulva is critical for TwoDay Method use. Women are encouraged to make these observations two times each day: once during the afternoon and once before going to bed at night. (If they have intercourse at times other than at night or early in the morning, they should adjust the times of observation accordingly to avoid confusing the presence of semen with secretions). As with the Billings or Creighton methods, users of the TwoDay Method note secretions on toilet paper or underwear, or by the feel at the vulva. Women usually use a chart to record the presence or absence of secretions and menses and thus identify their fertile days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60185\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60185 \">figure 5</a>). Women can learn to use the TwoDay Method anytime during a cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17530223\"><span class=\"h2\">Multimodal methods</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptothermal method</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptothermal method is based on changes in cervical secretions and basal body temperature produced by hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The presence of wet, slippery, transparent, or stretchy cervical secretions is the primary indicator of the beginning of the fertile phase of the cycle, and BBT elevation is the primary indicator of the end of the fertile phase.</p><p>The symptothermal method requires women to observe and evaluate their cervical secretions several times each day, take their temperature with a BBT thermometer (a thermometer calibrated to be easy to read in the temperature range of interest) each morning before rising, and record and interpret these findings to determine whether the day is a fertile day. Some symptothermal method users also check the position and feel of the cervix. Users of the symptothermal method need to abstain or avoid unprotected intercourse for approximately 12 to 17 days each cycle.</p><p>This method can be used by women with short, long, or irregular cycles. It is cumbersome and has no significant advantages over other methods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h4\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Efficacy studies indicate that this method has a correct use first year pregnancy rate of 2 per 100 women per year and a typical user pregnancy rate between 13 and 20 per 100 women per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. The wide range in failure rates reflects differences in study designs. The large difference between correct and typical use failure rates probably reflects the complexity of learning and using the method correctly and issues around avoiding unprotected intercourse on fertile days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h4\">Counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women require several instructional sessions to use the symptothermal method. They learn to observe, record, and interpret their cervical secretions, as well as to take their temperature using a BBT thermometer. They record their temperatures on a chart and attempt to identify the temperature rise associated with ovulation. Three higher temperatures following at least six days of lower temperature indicate that ovulation has occurred.</p><p>Symptothermal method users are counseled to avoid unprotected intercourse on potentially fertile days, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All days with secretions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All preovulatory days following days with intercourse (even if there are no secretions present because of the possible confusion with semen)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Until three days of higher temperature have followed at least six days of lower temperatures, or the fourth day after the last day with wet secretions, whichever happens later.</p><p/><p>Learning to observe and evaluate their secretions, and to take and observe their BBT, is critical for symptothermal method use. Women are encouraged to observe secretions before each urination and to take their temperature each day before rising. They record their observations of menses, secretions (and their characteristics), and temperature on a chart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50946\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50946 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Methods using mini-microscopes, computers, and other devices (eg, Marquette)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several devices that can help women identify their fertile days. These include mini microscopes that allow women to observe ferning of saliva or of cervical mucus (eg, PG53, PC2000, Maybe Baby), and handheld computers that measure cycle length and correlate the day of the cycle with BBT (eg, Babycomp, Ladycomp, Bioself 2000, Cyclotest 2 Plus). Research to evaluate the effectiveness of some of these devices to prevent pregnancy suggests that mini microscope-type devices would have high failure rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Studies of mini microscopes have not found them to be effective in helping women prevent pregnancy. Studies that have assessed the contraceptive efficacy of computing devices are inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. In one study, Persona, which measures urinary hormone metabolites to identify the fertile days, had a failure rate of 6 percent with correct use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The cost of these devices can be prohibitive for many women. </p><p>Studies of women using the Clearblue Easy Fertility Monitor indicate that the device provides accurate information about the fertile window, particularly when used with a calendar-based formula to double check the beginning and end of the fertile phase.&nbsp;This approach is referred to as the Marquette Model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3967373946\"><span class=\"h2\">Computer and phone applications (apps)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exponential growth and popularity of computer and smartphone applications (apps) related to fertility suggest that clinicians should be prepared to guide their patients in identifying and selecting apps that provide accurate information and are appropriate for particular needs. Some &quot;fertility apps&quot; are essentially digital platforms that support a woman's use of an existing FAB method, such as the symptothermal method, the ovulation method, or the Standard Days Method. These apps replace the traditional paper and pencil charts associated with these methods. If an app accurately represents the FAB method on which it is based, it can be assumed that its effectiveness for pregnancy avoidance would be the same as that for the underlying method. In a study that evaluated 95 fertility apps, over one-half (55) were excluded from the study because they either did not identify an evidence-based FAB method or they included a disclaimer that the app was not intended to avoid pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Of the remaining 40 apps, four accurately represented the Symptothermal method (commercial names Sympto, LilyPro, Lady Cycle, and nfNFP.net), and one accurately used the Standard Days method (commercial name CycleBeads). &#160; </p><p>Other fertility apps use algorithms, the majority of which are proprietary and have not been methodologically evaluated in the peer-reviewed literature. A prospective observational study of the Natural Cycles app that included over 18,500 woman-years of data reported a typical-use Pearl Index of 6.9 pregnancies per 100 woman-years (95% CI 6.5-7.2), a 13-month typical-use pregnancy rate of 8.3 percent, and a 12-month discontinuation rate of 54 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The Natural Cycle app uses an algorithm to predict fertile days based on input of basal body temperature data and dates of menstruation, with optional input of luteinizing hormone (LH) test results. Study limitations include lack of data on the methodology or assumptions for the app algorithm and limited data on episodes of sexual activity (ie, exposure). Another app, Dynamic Optimal Timing (Dot), uses an algorithm to predict fertile days based on period start dates. The algorithm was developed from a simulation analysis of data from two cohort studies and a prospective trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The efficacy study of Dot follows standard guidelines for determining perfect and typical use of contraceptive methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and has been registered with the United States National Institutes of Health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY AND LIMITATIONS OF DATA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have estimated the efficacy of the different FAB methods, but like all methods that require daily user action, typical use has lower efficacy than that observed in studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70218\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70218 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/17,27,30,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,27,30,44</a>]. This disparity is greater for more complex methods than for simpler ones. This highlights the need for screening and counseling women who elect to use these methods and choosing methods to which they can adhere.</p><p>There are no high-quality randomized trials comparing efficacy of different FAB methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The estimated effectiveness of the different FAB methods with optimal use appear comparable. However, the differences in efficacy are greater with typical use as compared with optimal use. As an example, failure rates of the Ovulation Method with typical use have been reported to be approximately 20 percent, while failure rates with typical use of the Standard Days Method have been reported to be 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Further, the population studied may impact the typical use failure rate, as observed with the symptothermal Method. </p><p>The time needed to learn the method and use it correctly must also be considered when assessing for the efficacy of a FAB method. Some early efficacy studies of FAB methods (specifically of the cervical mucus or ovulation method and the symptothermal method) enrolled women only after they had completed a learning phase, typically consisting of three cycles of use, while others enrolled women from the day they started using the methods. Since failure rates are highest during the early cycles of use, when patients are enrolled can be an important factor in study outcome. Subsequent studies of the Standard Days Method and the TwoDay Method enrolled women as soon as they started using the methods. Results of these studies showed that over 20 percent of couples had intercourse during their fertile days when they first learned to use a method, but that this percent dropped sharply during the first three months and continued to decline during the first year of use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], which partially explains the difference in reported failure rates for FAB methods. The fact that the Standard Days Method and the TwoDay Method are easier to use than the ovulation and symptothermal methods also may result in regular use, and thus greater effectiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">SAFETY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no evidence of direct harm from use of FAB methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, the harm from unintended pregnancies needs to be considered when evaluating any contraceptive method. Women with certain medical conditions should be advised that sole use of barrier methods for contraception and behavior-based methods of contraception may not be the most appropriate choice because of their relatively higher typical-use rates of failure.</p><p>Because unintended pregnancies among couples who use FAB methods usually result from having intercourse at the beginning or end of the fertile time, concerns have been raised about the risk of birth defects or poor pregnancy outcomes due to aged ovum or sperm. There is no evidence to support these concerns. Fertilization of aging gametes (ie, age from ejaculation or ovulation) is not associated with major birth defects or Down syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. A prospective study that evaluated rates of spontaneous abortion, low birth weight, or preterm birth among women who had an unintended pregnancy while using a FAB method versus women who had intended pregnancies reported no significant differences in these outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. An exception is that, in one prospective study, women with a history of spontaneous abortion had a greater chance of having another spontaneous abortion when conception occurred very early or late in the fertile time (23 percent versus 10 to 15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORICAL METHODS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Calendar rhythm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the early decades of the 20th century, it was known that women were more likely to become pregnant at midcycle and that the luteal phase was of a more fixed length than the follicular phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The calendar rhythm method was developed based on this information.</p><p>This method requires that, prior to using the method, the woman determine the length of her last six cycles and then subtract 18 from the number of days in her shortest cycle and 11 from the number of days in her longest cycle. This determines her fertile period, when unprotected intercourse should be avoided. As an example, if her shortest cycle is 26 days and her longest cycle is 34 days, then her fertile period is from day 8 to 23.</p><p>While undoubtedly serving to prevent many unplanned pregnancies, calendar rhythm resulted in high failure rates because it required the user to maintain records of cycle length prior to and during method use, involved arithmetical calculations each cycle, had no eligibility criteria, and had poorly-defined parameters. No well-designed efficacy trials of the calendar rhythm method have been conducted, and generally it is not offered in clinical services today.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Basal body temperature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By mid-century, the importance of the biphasic basal body temperature (BBT) pattern in determining ovulation was recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-awareness-based-methods-of-pregnancy-prevention/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Since BBT elevation identifies the end of the fertile period rather than the onset, users of this method have to avoid unprotected intercourse from the beginning of the cycle until at least three days of elevated temperature have occurred (ie, for well over one-half of the month). Thus, it is not a popular choice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">ON-LINE RESOURCES FOR FERTILITY AWARENESS-BASED METHODS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17961847\"><span class=\"h2\">Standard Days and TwoDay methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Information on the Standard Days and TwoDay methods is available from the Georgetown University Institute for Reproductive Health at <a href=\"http://www.irh.org/&amp;token=jI1rHVADkKBgzyKGmGDsidED1N/nPpdDkGANoDNLEkE=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5456\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.irh.org</a></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17961854\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical mucus or ovulation methods (Billings, Creighton)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Information on the Billings ovulation method is available from Billings Life at <a href=\"http://www.thebillingsovulationmethod.org/&amp;token=T4slFgMKaJb+0Y4X17Zdcuozgrmai5UTelN2JRSK2rl5JZ9+AwspkVfaWFPhc45953RJ6iam6WQLwS1KNZAEGA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5456\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.the billingsovulationmethod.org</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Information on the Creighton Model is available from the CREIGHTON MODEL FertilityCare&trade; System at <a href=\"http://www.creightonmodel.com/&amp;token=8WmZyxtCPDhnIAxHBR5GfDQpKwopnvOc4hItHhpYRoJ4LLH+7ZHZNTc+BNb0fS7z&amp;TOPIC_ID=5456\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.creightonmodel.com</a></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17961868\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptothermal method</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Information on the symptothermal method is available from the Fertility United Kingdom at <a href=\"http://www.fertilityuk.org/&amp;token=+SwWn4AsGwfVuv8GHxhIVSpo01YRcb3fPAqt1bLB2nNjIVrbUss/gWe/H6WqakyE&amp;TOPIC_ID=5456\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.fertilityuk.org</a></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17961875\"><span class=\"h2\">Marquette Model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Information on the Marquette Model is available from Marquette University at <a href=\"http://nfp.marquette.edu/&amp;token=5RDNj89vSYi3dsj+SARLuq1N/WHHIPG+VkXgjc8vP+QRnIcmq4NJ69YsNrbUsK2J&amp;TOPIC_ID=5456\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://nfp.marquette.edu</a></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4022717698\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
