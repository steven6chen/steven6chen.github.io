Both diseases result from abnormal regulation of the alternative complement pathway and are now classified under the heading of &quot;C3 glomerulopathies.&quot; The clinical presentation is variable, and the diagnosis is made by immunofluorescence&nbsp;examination of a kidney biopsy specimen, supplemented by studies of the complement system. Whenever possible, the pathogenic mechanism should be identified, as this can help guide therapy. </p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of the C3 glomerulopathies (DDD and C3GN) are discussed in this topic. C4 glomerulopathies, as well as general discussions of the differential diagnosis of glomerular disease and the classification of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, are presented elsewhere.

Historically, DDD was classified as a subgroup of primary membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN type II), but it is now reclassified as a complement-mediated glomerular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c3-glomerulopathies-dense-deposit-disease-and-c3-glomerulonephritis/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) was first described in 2007 in a clinicopathologic and genetic study of 19 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c3-glomerulopathies-dense-deposit-disease-and-c3-glomerulonephritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Subsequently, the term &quot;C3 glomerulopathy&quot; was introduced to encompass all glomerular lesions with predominant C3 accumulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c3-glomerulopathies-dense-deposit-disease-and-c3-glomerulonephritis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-classification-and-causes-of-membranoproliferative-glomerulonephritis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, classification, and causes of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis&quot;, section on 'Complement-mediated MPGN'</a>.)</p><p>The term &quot;dense deposit disease&quot; reflects the characteristic appearance of linear-appearing electron-dense material in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) observed on kidney biopsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F73319\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73319 \">picture 1</a>). </p><p>Like DDD, C3GN is characterized by isolated deposits of C3 on immunofluorescence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F91452\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91452 \">picture 2</a>), but instead of dense intramembranous deposits as in DDD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F73319\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73319 \">picture 1</a>), electron microscopy reveals subendothelial and mesangial electron-dense deposits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F91453\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91453 \">picture 3</a>). In some cases, subepithelial deposits can also be seen. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major defect underlying dense deposit disease (DDD) and C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) is excessive activation of the alternative complement pathway. This results in the deposition of multiple complement components in the glomerulus. The mechanism by which complement deposition leads to dense deposit formation or to the clinical manifestations of glomerulonephritis has not been established but most likely involves chemotaxis of leukocytes and possibly the cytolytic effects of C5b-9 (also called the membrane attack complex of complement, or MAC). </p><p>The alternative complement pathway is normally autoactivated by spontaneous cleavage of C3 to C3b, which leads to the formation of the C3 convertase by the binding of factor B and properdin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F59641\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59641 \">figure 1</a>). The C3 convertase, C3bBb, amplifies the cascade by enzymatically cleaving more C3 in addition to generating the downstream C5 convertase, (C3b)<sub>2</sub>Bb. The C5 convertase cleaves C5 to the potent chemoattractant, C5a, and initiates assembly of C5b-9 (ie, the membrane attack complex, or MAC). </p><p>Normally, the activity of this pathway is tightly regulated and directly related to the activity of the C3 convertase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F59641\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59641 \">figure 1</a>). The serum protein, factor H, regulates the activity of the alternative pathway in the fluid phase by directly promoting the decay of the C3 and C5 convertases. Factor H also combines with the regulator, factor I, to bind and rapidly inactivate free C3b. The alternative pathway is tightly regulated on cell surfaces by membrane cofactor protein, complement receptor 1 (CR1), and decay accelerating factor. CR1 also combines with factor I to bind and inactivate cell surface C3b. Complement pathways are reviewed in greater depth elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-pathways\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement pathways&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with DDD and C3GN, the activity of C3 convertase can be increased by one or both of the following mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generation of a C3 convertase stabilizing autoantibody called C3 nephritic factor (C3NeF), usually of the IgG class [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c3-glomerulopathies-dense-deposit-disease-and-c3-glomerulonephritis/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. C3NeF is found in 80 percent of patients with DDD and somewhat less often in C3GN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c3-glomerulopathies-dense-deposit-disease-and-c3-glomerulonephritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] but is not unique to these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c3-glomerulopathies-dense-deposit-disease-and-c3-glomerulonephritis/abstract/8-10,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10,13,14</a>]. C3NeF has also been found in the serum of healthy individuals, in those with meningococcal disease, and in patients with acquired partial lipodystrophy (APL), also called Barraquer-Simons' (or Dunnigan-Kobberling) syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c3-glomerulopathies-dense-deposit-disease-and-c3-glomerulonephritis/abstract/2,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14</a>]. C3 convertase stabilizing autoantibodies that bind factor B have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c3-glomerulopathies-dense-deposit-disease-and-c3-glomerulonephritis/abstract/13,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of functional factor H activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c3-glomerulopathies-dense-deposit-disease-and-c3-glomerulonephritis/abstract/1,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17-20</a>]. Factor H normally inhibits the C3 convertase and activated C3 (C3b). The loss of functional factor H activity results from mutations or acquired defects of factor H [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c3-glomerulopathies-dense-deposit-disease-and-c3-glomerulonephritis/abstract/1,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17-19</a>]. A C3 mutation that renders activated C3 resistant to factor H inhibition has also been described in patients with DDD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c3-glomerulopathies-dense-deposit-disease-and-c3-glomerulonephritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, a C3 mutation leading to functional factor H deficiency has been described in C3GN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c3-glomerulopathies-dense-deposit-disease-and-c3-glomerulonephritis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although such defects are not commonly seen in patients with DDD, when taken together with data from animal models, observations of such defects in patients have helped to establish the role of unregulated alternate pathway activation in the pathogenesis of DDD and C3GN.

The cofactor activity of factor H was mildly reduced, resulting in decreased mutant C3b inactivation in conjunction with factor I, while maintaining normal regulation of the C3 convertase. The mutant C3 was also resistant to binding with CR1, resulting in decreased cell surface mutant C3b inactivation and the possible atypical deposition of C3 near podocytes (which express CR1) in these two patients. This study is the first to suggest CR1 functional deficiency as a third mechanism of alternative pathway dysregulation. Soluble CR1 has previously been shown to decrease alternative pathway dysregulation in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c3-glomerulopathies-dense-deposit-disease-and-c3-glomerulonephritis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p>It is possible that subtle differences in factor H levels or activity confer a risk for DDD since several allelic variants of the factor H gene and a closely related gene, factor H-related 5 (CFHR5), have been associated with DDD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c3-glomerulopathies-dense-deposit-disease-and-c3-glomerulonephritis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A genetic analysis of 66 patients with DDD demonstrated that, compared with healthy controls, allelic variants of factor H or C3 genes increased the risk of developing the disease by up to twofold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c3-glomerulopathies-dense-deposit-disease-and-c3-glomerulonephritis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>These reports provide compelling evidence of the role of factor H in the development of DDD in select cases.

In addition, an acquired factor H deficiency may be causal in the pathogenesis of DDD in select patients, presumably due to the development of an inactivating autoantibody to the factor H protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c3-glomerulopathies-dense-deposit-disease-and-c3-glomerulonephritis/abstract/13,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,34,35</a>].</p><p>DDD has been reported in association with monoclonal gammopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c3-glomerulopathies-dense-deposit-disease-and-c3-glomerulonephritis/abstract/34,36-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36-43</a>].

Normally, the activity of this pathway is tightly regulated and directly related to the activity of the C3 convertase. In patients with DDD and C3GN, the activity of C3 convertase can be increased by a variety of mechanisms. This results in the deposition of multiple complement components in the glomerulus.

The discovery of a lesion suggesting DDD or C3GN in an older adult should always initiate a search for a monoclonal gammopathy. DDD appears to affect both genders equally, although trends in both directions have been observed in some studies. Major manifestations of the C3 glomerulopathies include proteinuria (ranging from mild to nephrotic range) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hematuria, depressed serum C3 levels, and variable degrees of azotemia and hypertension.

(See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'General measures'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-statins-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for statins in nondialysis chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mild disease &ndash; In patients with mild disease characterized by hematuria, mild proteinuria (ie, less than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> and normal kidney function, we suggest general measures alone rather than therapy with plasma infusion, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We would use these other therapies only if the clinical status worsens. (See <a href=\"#H8333547\" class=\"local\">'Overall approach to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Moderately severe disease &ndash; In patients with more severe proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> azotemia (but not rapidly progressive disease), treatment is based upon the underlying etiology, if known.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Disease due to an autoantibody &ndash; In patients whose disease is presumably due to a circulating autoantibody, for example, C3 nephritic factor (C3NeF) or an anti-factor H antibody, there is no consensus among the authors and reviewers of this topic. We suggest that initial therapy include plasma exchange, combined immunosuppression, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a> (in patients with elevated levels of sMAC) rather than other therapies such as glucocorticoid monotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Plasma infusion or exchange'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8333765\" class=\"local\">'Eculizumab'</a> above and <a href=\"#H528308159\" class=\"local\">'Immunosuppressive therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8334903\" class=\"local\">'Rituximab'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Disease due to a genetic deficiency &ndash; In patients whose disease is presumably due to an inherited deficiency in a serum factor, for example, inherited factor H deficiency, we suggest periodic infusions of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to replace the missing or mutant protein (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Plasma infusion or exchange'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Disease due to a genetic activating mutation in C3 &ndash; In such patients, we suggest plasma exchange (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), which theoretically can remove the abnormal C3 protein and replace it with a normal protein that can be inactivated by factor H. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Plasma infusion or exchange'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Often, specialized diagnostic tests are unavailable and the underlying etiology cannot be identified. In such patients, we suggest a trial of plasma infusion (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8333547\" class=\"local\">'Overall approach to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with rapidly deteriorating renal function &ndash; In patients with rapidly progressive disease (eg, crescentic glomerulonephritis), we suggest immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids in combination with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Some would also treat such patients with plasma exchange in addition to immunosuppressive therapy. In patients with a genetic serum factor deficiency, we would treat with periodic FFP infusion after remission is achieved. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Treatment for RPGN'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with an underlying monoclonal gammopathy &ndash; Patients who are found to have a monoclonal gammopathy should be evaluated further for an underlying malignancy (such as multiple myeloma) or evidence of end-organ involvement. Overall treatment of these patients will depend upon the extent of the monoclonal gammopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis of DDD is generally poor. Prognosis of C3GN is variable but tends to be better than DDD. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/c3-glomerulopathies-dense-deposit-disease-and-c3-glomerulonephritis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Smith RJ, Alexander J, Barlow PN, et al.
