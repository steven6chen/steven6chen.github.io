The suffering that characterizes the period before death can be related, at least in part, to the experience of unrelieved symptoms.</p><p>Pain is among the most prevalent of these symptoms. When pain is unrelieved, it can be a source of great distress. This distress not only can affect the patient but also may extend to family caregivers, who may experience guilt, anger directed at medical personnel, or regret that persists long into the future. The care of patients with unrelieved pain also may adversely affect professional caregivers, potentially increasing the risk of burnout.</p><p>The proper management of pain at the end of life is imperative and the necessary analgesic interventions are well within the purview of primary care providers. All clinicians who care for the chronically ill should acquire basic skills in pain management.</p><p>The assessment and management of pain in the last weeks of life are discussed here. The ethical issues surrounding pain control at the end of life, management of symptoms, including pain, in the last hours to days of life, and control of other symptoms in patients in the last days to weeks of life are discussed elsewhere.

Palliative care is a growing practice specialty for clinicians, nurses, social workers, chaplains, and others; in 2006, Hospice and Palliative Medicine became a recognized subspecialty for clinicians in the United States. Palliative medicine specialists are experts on end of life concerns, and, while palliative care is useful even at the time of diagnosis of a serious <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> life-threatening illness, the end of life is often when the need for specialist-level care is greatest.

The concept of &quot;total pain&quot; recognizes that pain at the end of life encompasses more than the &quot;physical&quot; pain associated with the physical ravages of disease, and can include emotional, social, and spiritual aspects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-assessment-and-management-in-the-last-weeks-of-life/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Comprehensive pain assessment must include all these factors in an effort to understand the contribution of pain to suffering. As described in a document known as the Consensus Project for Best Practices in Palliative Care, pain and symptom control is a key domain of palliative care but must be combined with other strategies in a broader approach to the patient with serious or life-threatening illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-assessment-and-management-in-the-last-weeks-of-life/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

To clarify the best approach for pain management in an individual patient, the clinician must explore the willingness of the patient to tolerate side effects or reduced functioning in order to achieve relief, the openness of the patient to procedures such as nerve blocks or neuraxial infusion, and the ability of the caregivers to understand and support the patient in decision making.

Surveys indicate that most people would prefer to die at home, but the reality is that fewer than one-quarter of patients in the United States actually do [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-assessment-and-management-in-the-last-weeks-of-life/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Although the national average for deaths in the hospital has decreased to 23 percent, there are large regional variations and in some areas more than 40 percent die in the hospital. Although utilization of home hospice programs has increased to 50 percent, the average length of stay is still only 22.9 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-assessment-and-management-in-the-last-weeks-of-life/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Access to specialist palliative care is increasing, primarily through hospice programs and institution-based palliative care consultation teams, and to a lesser extent through the appearance of community-based palliative care initiatives, and these programs may be an important resource for pain management in many settings.

These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-symptom-assessment-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to symptom assessment in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pain assessment begins with a detailed characterization of the pain. Specific questions should be directed to pain location; onset, duration, course and daily fluctuation; severity; quality; factors that relieve or provoke the pain; and associated symptoms. The impact of the pain on varied functional domains, including physical activity, mood, interactions in the family and others, should be clarified. Information about the prior evaluation of the pain and the outcomes of prior and existing analgesic therapies should be noted.</p><p>A key goal in the pain assessment is to understand the etiology of the pain and the pathophysiologic processes that are sustaining it. In many cases, a specific syndrome can be identified. Understanding the etiology of the pain may facilitate disease-modifying therapy, which can have analgesic consequences (for example, radiation therapy for bone metastases). In addition, inferences about pathophysiology may guide analgesic drug selection and other interventions. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> below.) Diagnostic interventions to determine the source of the pain may present more of a burden than a benefit, however, in patients with advanced disease who are not candidates for surgical or radiation therapy.</p><p>The ability to assess pain characteristics, including severity, may become compromised as cognitive functioning declines, and it may be necessary to supplement verbal reports with behavioral measures of pain severity. These include vocalization, breathing patterns, facial patterns, and consolability. If desired, a validated tool based on these behaviors, such as the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAID (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F59509\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59509 \">table 1</a>)), Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F103690\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103690 \">table 2</a>)), and the Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F103691\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103691 \">table 3</a>)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-assessment-and-management-in-the-last-weeks-of-life/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>], can be used to obtain greater precision; many other tools are available, but are mainly used in research settings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F102313\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102313 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>Although it is appropriate to query a family caregiver to obtain information about potential pain and other sources of distress when cognitive impairment precludes direct assessment, clinicians must exercise caution when relying on proxy reports. As an example, in a large cohort of hospitalized patients with advanced illness, surrogates correctly identified the existence of pain 73 percent of the time, but accurately estimated its severity in only 53 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-assessment-and-management-in-the-last-weeks-of-life/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A proxy report should be viewed as one source of information that can be used to inform treatment in the cognitively impaired patient.</p><p>Given the risk of undertreatment, clinicians should assess pain frequently and maintain a low threshold for the conclusion that pain exists. Noting the physical condition of the patient, the clinician should ask &quot;would I be in pain?&quot;. If the answer is &quot;yes,&quot; it is best to assume that pain exists and that intervention is appropriate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for pain at the end of life.

These effects of the d-isomer may explain the observation that switching to methadone from another drug can be associated with unanticipated high potency (ie, a dose produces a larger effect than would otherwise be anticipated) or efficacy (more analgesia occurs than that obtained with another opioid).

Although some clinicians choose the dose of a transmucosal immediate-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> formulation to be proportional to the basal dose of the long-acting opioid, the approach recommended by the manufacturers of these drugs is to select one of the lowest doses to start, irrespective of the overall daily dose. &#160;</p><p>Regardless of the route of administration, the key to successful opioid therapy is individualization of the dose through a process of repeated dose adjustment, combined with treatment of side effects. The dose should be gradually increased until either satisfactory pain relief occurs or the patient develops intolerable and unmanageable side effects. The absolute dose of opioid is immaterial as long as the balance between efficacy and adverse effects is favorable.

Pretreatment risk stratification can be helpful to estimate the risk of NSAID-induced GI toxicity and guide management. The risk of ulcer is relatively higher in the elderly, those with prior history of NSAID-induced gastroduodenopathy, those with history of peptic ulcer, and those receiving a concurrent glucocorticoid or anticoagulant. The risk is reduced by coadministration of a gastroprotective agent (a proton pump inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>, or possibly a high dose H2 inhibitor) and by the use of a COX-2-selective NSAID.

When associated with serious illness, opioid therapy usually is tried first. If response is relatively poor, a trial of an adjuvant analgesic often is considered. There are numerous drugs in diverse classes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56216\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56216 \">table 15</a>).

In the setting of advanced illness, when pain typically is associated with other symptoms, prescription of a glucocorticoid (eg, dexamethasone 1 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> is very common, although the evidence to support efficacy in this setting is weak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-assessment-and-management-in-the-last-weeks-of-life/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Like NSAIDs, the analgesic antidepressants and anticonvulsants are available only in oral formulations and may not be useful when oral intake is <span class=\"nowrap\">diminished/unavailable</span>. Dose titration from a low initial dose usually is needed to reduce the risk of side effects, and this requirement may reduce the utility of these drugs in those with a short life expectancy. </p><p>For patients at the end of life, discontinuation of an adjuvant analgesic is generally best accomplished after a brief period of dose tapering. This is done to reduce the risk of pain flare, and in some instances (eg, SSRIs), withdrawal symptoms.

(See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pain assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are three broad categories of analgesic medications: opioids, nonopioid analgesics (including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), and the so-called adjuvant analgesics, which comprise numerous agents in diverse classes. Opioids are the mainstay of treatment for pain at the end of life. Most adjuvant analgesics are commercially available for indications other than pain but are analgesic in specific circumstances, particularly neuropathic pain, bone pain, and the pain associated with malignant bowel obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonpharmacologic approaches for pain include psychological therapies (eg, guided imagery), treatments that have been conventionally labeled rehabilitative (eg, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, therapeutic exercise, or splints), a large number of specific nerve blocks, and treatments that are usually considered alternative or complementary, which include acupuncture, massage, and other mind-body approaches. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the small percentage of patients with advanced illness at the end of life who have refractory pain, palliative sedation is an option. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Palliative sedation'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pain-assessment-and-management-in-the-last-weeks-of-life/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">von Gunten CF.
