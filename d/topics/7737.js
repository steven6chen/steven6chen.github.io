Disease severity ranges from a score of zero (for those with chronic illnesses or a hip fracture) to three (for those in the intensive care unit [ICU] with an APACHE score of 10).

A review of results of the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) across settings and countries in Europe, the United States, and South Africa found the prevalence of malnutrition among 4507 people (mean age 82.3, 75.2 percent female) was 22.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Highest rates were in the rehabilitation setting (50.5 percent) and lowest among community dwellers (5.8 percent). Over one-third of hospitalized older adults (38.7 percent) in this study met the criteria for malnutrition.</p><p>Compared with younger adults, undernutrition in older individuals is both more common and may have greater impact on outcomes, including physical function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], health care utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], and length of stay for surgical hospitalizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Inadequate energy intake is common in hospitalized older adults, with increased risk associated with poor appetite, higher body mass index (BMI), diagnosis of infection or cancer, delirium, and need for assistance with feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Some studies suggest that older adults are less able to adapt to underfeeding. One study found that, following a period of experimental underfeeding, older adults experienced less frequent hunger than younger adults and did not regain the total amount of weight they had lost when allowed to consume food freely for six months while, on average, younger adults regained all their lost weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. By contrast, a similar study did not demonstrate age differences in <em>ad libitum </em>intake, anthropometric indices, gastric emptying rate, and cholecystokinin levels in blood after a period of underfeeding and then consumption of food freely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The lack of ability to compensate for periods of low food intake due to illness or other difficulties can result in long-term, persistent weight changes, especially when combined with social, medical, or psychological factors that can negatively impact body weight.</p><p>Involuntary weight loss may be driven by variety of factors, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate dietary intake</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appetite loss (anorexia)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disuse or muscle atrophy (sarcopenia)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory effects of disease (cachexia)</p><p/><p>or a combination of these factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Inadequate dietary intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple causes of weight loss due to inadequate nutrient intake.

One-third of persons over 65 and one-half over 85 live alone, which typically decreases food enjoyment and calorie intake. Several studies have demonstrated that older adults who eat in the presence of others consume more than those who eat alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Financial limitations affecting food acquisition.

In another study of unexplained weight loss in 45 ambulatory older adults, the most common identified cause for weight loss was depression (18 percent), again followed by malignancy (16 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Depression is an important cause of weight loss in the subacute care and nursing home settings, as well as in older patients in the community.

Oropharyngeal dysphagia may occur due to stroke, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Zenker's diverticula, and other motility or structural disorders. Esophageal dysphagia can be due to motility problems (eg, achalasia, diffuse esophageal spasm, scleroderma) and structural issues.

Because of the presence of underlying inflammation and catabolism, cachexia often is resistant to nutritional intervention. Despite the evidence supporting inflammation as an essential mechanism for cachexia, antiinflammatory medications or drugs targeting cytokines have not demonstrated beneficial effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Potential drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a>, selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, w3-fatty acids like eicosapentaenoic acid, and anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents have shown variable efficacy in treating cachexia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The cause of cachexia is multifactorial, and thus treatment should be multimodal, including the use of a combination of an appetite stimulant and an agent promoting muscle protein synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Cachexia usually occurs in the setting of underlying illness involving a cytokine-mediated response. Such illnesses include cancer, end-stage renal disease, chronic pulmonary disease, heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</p><p>Proinflammatory cytokines commonly involved in cachexia include interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha (TNF-a) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. These cytokines promote myofibrillar breakdown by activating the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. In addition, release of cortisol and adrenergic hormones stimulated by cytokines can increase fat oxidation, fat atrophy, insulin resistance, hypermetabolism, and fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>In a study of older Framingham Heart Study participants, levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and muscle mass decreased, whereas IL-6 levels increased, with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. These changes appear to occur even in the absence of overt disease, suggesting that a subclinical inflammatory process may be part of normal aging. Although elevated proinflammatory cytokines (especially IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-a) are commonly seen in older adults, levels are higher in those with cachexia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Sarcopenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by the loss of muscle mass, strength, and performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. Low muscle mass is defined as a decrease in appendicular muscle mass two standard deviations below the mean for young healthy adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], and is usually measured by DEXA or bio-electrical impedance in clinical practice. Unlike cachexia, sarcopenia does not require the presence of an underlying illness. Also, whereas most people with cachexia are sarcopenic, most sarcopenic individuals are not considered cachectic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Sarcopenia is associated with increased rates of functional impairment, disability, falls, and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The causes of sarcopenia are multifactorial and can include disuse, changing endocrine function, chronic diseases, inflammation, insulin resistance, and nutritional deficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Sarcopenia was identified in 53 to 57 percent of men, and 43 to 60 percent of women, over the age of 80 in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Loss of muscle mass, accompanied by decreased muscle strength, can occur in overweight individuals (sarcopenic-obese), as well as in normal and underweight individuals.</p><p>Causes of sarcopenia include endocrine changes, activation of proinflammatory cytokines, reduced alpha motor units in the spinal cord, decreased physical activity, and suboptimal protein intake.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reductions in testosterone and estrogen that accompany aging appear to accelerate the development of sarcopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Relative deficiencies of estrogen and testosterone contribute to muscle catabolism and promotion of catabolic cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Furthermore, testosterone inhibits myostatin, stimulates myoblast, and increases satellite cells within muscle. Testosterone replacement may increase muscle mass, but studies have not demonstrated similar benefit for estrogen replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>]. Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARM), such as enobosarm, are a promising potential treatment for sarcopenia. A phase II trial of enobosarm in healthy older adults led to increases in lean body mass and improvement in stair climbing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insulin resistance increases with age. Insulin inhibits muscle breakdown and the reduction of insulin action on muscle may contribute to muscle catabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical activity declines with age. In the United States, 28 to 34 percent of adults aged 65 to 74 and 35 to 44 percent of adults ages 75 or older are inactive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Inactivity exacerbates ongoing muscle loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>] and increases proportion of body fat mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate protein intake can also contribute to sarcopenia and decreased function. A prospective cohort study found that adults aged 70 to 79 with protein intake &le;0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> (the Recommended Dietary Allowance [RDA]) were at greater risk of developing mobility limitations over six years of follow-up than those with protein intake &ge;1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION OF WEIGHT LOSS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recommendations vary on the degree of weight loss, and the period of time for weight loss, that should prompt clinical investigation. One commonly accepted definition for clinically important weight loss is loss of 4 to 5 percent of total body weight over 6 to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Unintentional weight loss should lead to clinical concern regardless of whether the patient is overweight at baseline. Whether or not intentional weight loss is of concern remains a matter of some speculation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following steps are suggested in the initial evaluation of an older person who is noted to have lost weight, or for whom concern is raised about weight loss by the patient, family members, or caregivers.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Document the weight loss. While it is important to note objective evidence of weight loss from recorded serial weights over time, this information is often not available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Body fat and lean muscle mass may be estimated using bioelectrical impedance or anthropometric measures such as mean upper arm circumference (MUAC) or mid-arm circumference. MUAC measures the circumference of the left upper arm at the mid-point between the tip of the shoulder and the tip of the elbow (olecranon process and the acromion). MUAC of less than 22 cm for women and 23 cm for men are suggestive of chronic energy deficiency. Although suggestive of malnutrition, it is unclear whether MUAC predicts mortality and morbidity. The MUST screening tool uses mid-arm circumference measures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Bioelectrical impedance measures are available for use with wheelchair bound and bedbound patients, although bioelectrical impedance is significantly influenced by hydration status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluate appetite and dietary intake. Determining if there has been a change in hunger and satiety may provide more clinically revealing information than performing a formal dietary recall. Patients should be questioned regarding appetite, their dietary intake in relation to their usual pattern, the number of meals they consume per day, portion size, snacks between meals, if and when they feel full during their meal, and whether the patient likes what he or she is eating. The Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), and Simplified Nutritional Appetite Questionnaire (SNAQ) all evaluate aspects of dietary intake in this way (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Screening tools'</a> above). A more formal dietary intake assessment can be obtained with a dietetic consult.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform a complete history and physical examination, and order appropriate laboratory studies. As a baseline, we suggest laboratory evaluation for evidence of metabolic or inflammatory disease, to include a basic chemistry profile including glucose and electrolytes, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), complete blood count (CBC), and C-reactive protein (CRP) if cachexia is suspected. Chest and plain abdomen radiographs may be considered. Although studies describing the causes of involuntary weight loss have routinely performed chest radiographs and abdominal films, there is no clear evidence of their value. Order addition studies based on suspicion of underlying disease from the patient's history and examination.</p><p/><p>Those with no localizing findings and with normal complete blood count, biochemical profile, or chest and plain abdomen radiographs have been considered by some to have isolated involuntary weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. In one series, a little more than one-third of patients were ultimately diagnosed with a malignancy. Multivariate analysis found the strongest predictors of neoplasm in the setting of isolated involuntary weight loss were age &gt;80 years, white blood cell count <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;12,000/mm<sup>3</sup>,</span> serum albumin &lt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> serum alkaline phosphatase &gt; 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L,</span> and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L</span>.

The diagnostic yield of a <span class=\"nowrap\">thoracic/abdominal/pelvic</span> computed tomography (CT) examination to assess for occult or metastatic malignant disease has not been determined. Incidental findings are common, the studies are costly, and may be inappropriate in patients who are frail or who have multiple comorbidities.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of evidence-based recommendations, we suggest ordering a <span class=\"nowrap\">thoracic/abdominal/pelvic</span> CT scan with and without contrast for the patient with significant ongoing weight loss. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be ordered as an alternative when intravenous (IV) contrast cannot be administered, assuming there are no contraindications; patients with chronic renal failure should not be given gadolinium.
