The major interventions that are used to minimize this risk include questioning of donors concerning HIV risk behaviors and laboratory testing of each donated unit of blood for antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2 and for HIV-1 RNA. In the United States this is done by pooling of 6 to 16 specimens (minipool nucleic acid testing, or MP-NAT), whereas in some other countries this is done as individual donation testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Procedures and processes to enhance safety for the blood recipient and the blood donor&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-medical-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Medical history&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The rate of HIV seropositivity in the blood donor population has been shown to be approximately 0.3 per 10,000 donations, a value much lower than the rate of 3.5 per 10,000 donations shortly after the introduction of routine HIV antibody screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. When analyzed in first time blood donors, the rate is 1 per 10,000 to 20,000 donors and has remained stable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Because of careful donor selection criteria, it has been calculated that HIV seroprevalence in blood donors is less than 2 percent of that expected in the adult American population.</p><p>Despite these procedures, HIV transmission may still occur for three theoretical reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Donations may be collected during the window period of infection, defined as the interval of time shortly after HIV infection, when the donor is infectious but has not yet developed positive HIV laboratory tests.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection with variant strains of HIV that may escape detection by current screening assays.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing or clerical errors.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF HIV INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When considering the risk of acquiring HIV infection from a transfusion, it is necessary to group the data into timeframes defined by implementation of different HIV testing strategies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Before HIV antibody testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data obtained in 1985 prior to the availability of HIV testing showed that approximately 90 percent of transfused recipients acquired HIV infection when given an HIV seropositive blood component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Transmission rates of HIV are equivalent from red cells, platelets, or plasma. However, red cells stored for more than 21 days or red cells that are saline washed (and therefore have lower leukocyte concentrations) may transmit HIV infection at a lower rate than other stored components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].</p><p>Assuming that patients survive their underlying disease long enough to develop AIDS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States estimated that 12,000 to 25,000 cases of transfusion-associated AIDS cases may have resulted from HIV untested blood components transfused prior to the use of antibody testing, which began in 1985 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. HIV-infected transfusion recipients developed AIDS at the same rate as age matched cohorts infected by HIV via other transmission routes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">After HIV antibody testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As early as 1988, case reports of transfusion transmitted AIDS from HIV seronegative blood were being investigated by the CDC. Through June 1992, the CDC had received 201 AIDS case reports in which the only acknowledged mode of HIV exposure was one or more transfusions received from 1986 through 1991 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, upon further investigation, only 14 of these 201 cases were confirmed to be due to infections from screened blood transfusions. In many of these cases, an infected donor was identified who had given blood shortly following a high-risk exposure, ie, in the preseroconversion infectious window period.</p><p>After adjustment for non-investigated cases, the CDC investigators estimated that approximately five AIDS cases per year were due to infections from anti-HIV screened blood transfusions. Since AIDS case reports underestimate the number of HIV transfusion transmissions, several studies have attempted to directly study or estimate this risk. Prior to 1995, there were multiple published estimates of the risk of HIV transmission from antibody negative blood; these ranged from a risk of one in 36,000 units to a risk of one in 225,000 units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. The two major reasons for the differences in these estimates are the time period of data collection and the geographic location in which the study was performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">After p24 antigen testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the mid-1990s, two independent estimates for nationwide HIV risk were made by the CDC and the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study (REDS) using data obtained after the implementation of more sensitive recombinant antigen-based third generation anti-HIV tests that are capable of detecting early IgM and IgG responses to HIV infection. These estimates were based upon the transfusion of HIV-infected units donated during the preseroconversion window period and were determined by multiplying the length of the HIV window period by the annual incidence of HIV infection in blood donors.</p><p>The CDC estimated the HIV risk per unit to be one in 450,000 to 650,000 units; REDS estimated a similar risk of one in 493,000 units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The concordance of these two estimates suggested that they were likely to be generalizable on a national level. With the implementation of HIV-1 p24 antigen testing in 1996, which has subsequently been discontinued, these estimates needed to be corrected for the anticipated further benefit provided by this test; an adjustment of the REDS estimate gave a per unit risk of one in 677,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>After implementation of HIV-1 p24 antigen testing in the United States in 1996, the detection rate of HIV infected donors by this assay occurred at a rate of one in six million donations, which was lower than that predicted from mathematical modeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In retrospect, the model assumed that seroconverting donors donate at a rate consistent with their previous donation behavior during the preseroconversion period. However, since this phase of HIV infection is frequently characterized by clinical or subclinical illness (the acute HIV syndrome), it now appears that HIV-1 p24 antigenemic donors were less likely to donate, possibly because of their febrile symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3129590\"><span class=\"h2\">After nucleic acid testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1999, the HIV window period was further reduced by adding a second type of testing that uses detection of plasma HIV RNA in samples that are pooled together from 6 to 16 blood donors (or a larger number of plasma donors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This assay, known as minipool nucleic acid testing (MP-NAT), detects HIV earlier than the p24 viral protein or anti-HIV antibody. Due to the increased sensitivity of HIV MP-NAT for detecting early window period infection, the risk of HIV infection from transfusion has further decreased and is now estimated to be one in approximately 1.5 to 2 million units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/4,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,19,20</a>].</p><p>In the first three years (1999 to 2002) after implementation of HIV MP-NAT in the United States, 12 HIV RNA positive, HIV antibody negative units were identified, for a rate of one HIV RNA positive, antibody negative unit per 3.1 million units tested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In 2011 to 2012, 13 units were identified for a rate of 1 in 1.1 million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. HIV MP-NAT is estimated to have prevented five transfusion-transmitted cases annually, at an estimated cost of 1.5 to 4.3 million dollars per quality-adjusted year of life saved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Nevertheless, rare cases of HIV infection from transfusion have still been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/1,2,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,23,24</a>].</p><p>The effectiveness of NAT testing to narrow the HIV window depends upon the analytical sensitivity of the assay method and the dilution factor of the sample (ie, the size of the plasma pool). It has been estimated that the most common screening system in the US detects approximately 500 HIV RNA <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL,</span> 95 percent of the time, in each of the specimens entering the pool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The fact that all HIV-1 p24 antigen positive samples were identified as HIV positive by HIV MP-NAT has allowed for discontinuation of p24 antigen testing as part of blood donor screening.</p><p>The approach of using minipools for NAT has been adopted in place of individual donation (ID) HIV NAT due to the difficulty in achieving adequate throughput even with the automated testing systems that have been developed, the cost of ID testing, and the relatively low incremental yield. HIV risk in the US with MP NAT testing in place is one in 1.4 million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The further window period closure to be achieved by ID NAT relative to MP NAT has been estimated to be 3.4 days (ie, reducing the window period to eight days); implementation of this testing would be expected to detect two to three HIV infectious units per year, resulting in an HIV risk of one in three to four million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A cost effectiveness analysis, taking MP-NAT as the baseline, indicated that the marginal cost of introducing ID-NAT for HIV in combination with HCV and HBV would exceed $12 million per quality associated life year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In some countries with a very high HIV incidence (eg, South Africa), ID NAT has been implemented. Other countries where incidence is not as high have different practices (eg, in China all blood is screened using HIV serology, and the addition of pooled NAT is being phased in at varying rates in different blood centers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Additional discussion of testing of donated blood is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing&quot;, section on 'Infectious disease screening'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Defining the HIV window period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first approach used to generate an estimate for the infectious window period preceding HIV seroconversion used the mathematical relationship between the window period, the inter-donation interval (the interval between seronegative and seropositive donations in an HIV seroconverting donor) and whether the seronegative unit transmitted HIV infection to a recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Based upon evaluation of recipients of blood units from donors who later developed HIV antibody, this window period was estimated to be 56 days with the first generation antibody assays introduced in 1985 and 42 days with the second generation assays introduced in 1987 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Addition of MP-NAT testing reduced the window period to 11 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>It is important not to equate the viremic preseroconversion window period determined by the above methodologies with the time period from exposure to seroconversion. Data from animal models indicate that there is a period of days to weeks following HIV exposure during which virus is replicating in regional lymphoid tissue prior to dissemination into peripheral blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Thus, the &quot;exposure-to-seroconversion&quot; window period is longer than the &quot;infectious&quot; window period.</p><p>Another issue is that data related to infections transmitted by intravascular infusions of 20 to 200 mL of plasma from blood components produced from a donor in the high titer viremic preseroconversion stage of primary infection cannot be directly extrapolated to other exposure routes and inoculation volumes (eg, needlestick exposure, injection drug use, and sexual exposure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-nonoccupational-exposures-to-hiv-and-hepatitis-b-and-c-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of nonoccupational exposures to HIV and hepatitis B and C in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER POTENTIAL REASONS FOR HIV TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transfusion of window period units are thought to account for virtually all current cases of HIV transfusion-transmission. Lack of transmission from other sources is discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">HIV genetic variation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of HIV genetic variation for transfusion safety relates to whether screening assays can detect either the genetic material of various HIV subtypes and clades, or can detect antibodies to these different subtypes that may be present in the ethnically and geographically diverse population that donates blood. HIV can be classified into broad groups based upon nucleic acid sequence analysis of envelope (env) and core (gag) genes; HIV-1 and HIV-2 are at the extremes of this diversity. An overview of genetic variation is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-genetic-variation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of genetic variation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The HIV-1 family is phylogenetically subclassified into main (M), outlier (O), and non-major and non-outlier (N) groups. Group M is further divided into nine distinct subtypes, or clades, designated A through K (with E and I having been reclassified as circulating recombinant strains [CRFs]); group O is also composed of a set of divergent clades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>HIV-1 clade B is by far the predominant subtype in the United States. For this reason, HIV antibody assays use HIV-1 clade B viral lysate or recombinant proteins derived from HIV-1 clade B as the antigenic material. These assays are highly sensitive to infection due to HIV-1 clades A-H. However, these assays fail to detect occasional samples from more diverse variants, such as HIV-2 and HIV-1 group O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>HIV-2 was discovered in 1985 in West Africa and subsequently in Western Europe. Although HIV-1 has had an extremely prominent role in blood safety, this is not the case for HIV-2. While there have been thousands of cases of transfusion transmitted HIV-1 infection, there have been fewer than 50 such cases attributed to HIV-2 (occurring primarily in Portugal), and none from units donated during the window period since the implementation of combined HIV-1 and HIV-2 serologic testing in Europe and North America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>HIV-1 and HIV-2 crossreact immunologically to a great extent; as a result, up to 90 percent of sera from HIV-2-infected persons test positive on FDA-licensed HIV-1-based screening assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, because the sensitivity of HIV-1 antibody assays for HIV-2 is less than 100 percent, a combined assay using both HIV-1 and HIV-2 antigens was introduced into routine blood donor screening in the United States in 1992. HIV-2 infection has remained extremely rare in US blood donors. In 10 years of HIV-2 testing, fewer than five HIV-2 infected blood donors were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. HIV-2 is also rare in European blood donors; for example, only 1 percent of HIV seropositive donors in France were infected with HIV-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>In mid-1994, French investigators reported that some persons infected with HIV-1 group O, a variant endemic in some central African countries, tested negative on a number of HIV-1 antibody and <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV-1/HIV-2</span> antibody combination assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In July 1996, the first case of group O infection in North America was reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Due to the rarity of group O infection and the ability of current HIV antibody assays to crossreact with most group O infected donors, the contribution of such genetically divergent infections to transfusion transmitted HIV risk will be negligible. Nevertheless, the FDA in December 1996 implemented policies to exclude from donation persons from countries in Africa in which group O variants are endemic. The FDA is encouraging HIV antibody test manufacturers to enhance their tests with antigens that can detect antibodies to all group O isolates. Some of these newer tests are now available and, when used, allow blood centers to no longer solicit information about exposure to HIV through travel to these endemic African countries.</p><p>A national study that performed HIV-1 genetic typing of 316 HIV seropositive donors from 1997-2000 revealed that only 2 percent were infected with HIV-1, non-clade B strains. Four of the seven non-clade B donors appeared to have acquired their infection in Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Studies of HIV infected donors from 1999 through 2007 have shown very similar findings with only 3 percent of HIV-infected blood donors demonstrating non-clade B infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. These data are consistent with other studies indicating the rarity of non-clade B infection in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Technical error</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with any test, the possibility of technical error exists with HIV blood donor screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, since HIV screening currently includes two independent assays, any errors in antibody testing would be very unlikely to occur in both test systems simultaneously. Therefore, testing error should make no contribution to HIV risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing&quot;, section on 'HIV-1 and HIV-2'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">VIRAL INACTIVATION OF BLOOD COMPONENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV is inactivated by the purification process used to produce plasma derivatives such as albumin and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG). Thus, there has never been a documented case of HIV transmission from albumin or immune globulin preparations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogen inactivation of blood products&quot;, section on 'Plasma derivatives including fibrinogen'</a>.)</p><p>Prior to 1984, HIV transmission to hemophiliacs from infected antihemophilic factor (AHF) concentrates was common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Since the implementation of improved viral inactivation procedures (eg, pasteurization, chromatography, <span class=\"nowrap\">solvent/detergent</span> treatment) for plasma derivatives in the mid-1980s, their gradual improvement in the ensuing few years, and the addition of HIV antibody and RNA testing, there have been no documented HIV transmissions from AHF concentrates. In vitro data demonstrate that these procedures kill HIV in a logarithmic fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Testing of individual donors is still required in order to exclude plasmas with extremely high viral titers, which might otherwise escape these inactivation procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogen inactivation of blood products&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since HIV can be readily inactivated in plasma derivatives, considerable effort has been directed towards inactivating HIV (and other pathogens) in blood components after they have tested negative for HIV by the HIV antibody and RNA tests. The value of adding such technology is to eliminate the residual risk from window period donations as well as the theoretical risk from genetic variants and test performance error.</p><p>With respect to pathogen inactivation of platelets, one approach is the addition of amotosalen (a psoralen compound) to an individual blood component; upon photoactivation with ultraviolet light (UV-A), the nucleic acids of HIV and other viruses are altered to achieve viral inactivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Pathogen inactivated platelets prepared by this method are available in the US and elsewhere. Pathogen inactivated platelets prepared using an alternate method (riboflavin and UV light) are available outside the US and are used in many countries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogen-inactivation-of-blood-products#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogen inactivation of blood products&quot;, section on 'Platelets'</a>.)</p><p>Individual Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) units can also be pathogen inactivated using the amotosalen-UVA technology. In addition, an alternative to FFP is the use of solvent detergent-treated plasma <span class=\"nowrap\">(S/D</span> plasma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

The major interventions used to minimize this risk include questioning donors concerning HIV risk behaviors, laboratory testing for HIV antibody and minipool nucleic acid testing (MP-NAT), and inactivation of HIV in plasma derivatives (eg, albumin, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>, and plasma-derived clotting factors).

The window period is approximately 11 days with combined HIV antibody and MP-NAT testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of transfusion-transmitted HIV infection in the US is one in approximately 1.5 to 2 million units.
