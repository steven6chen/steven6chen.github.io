(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is considerable interest in the diagnosis of CHD when patients are still asymptomatic and prior to the development of hard endpoints (eg, myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac arrest), which are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. However, questions persist regarding the appropriateness and cost effectiveness of screening for CHD along with the optimal approach to screening. This is largely due to the lack of evidence that screening for CHD can improve outcomes more than obtaining a CHD risk assessment and implementing appropriate primary preventive measures aimed at known CHD risk factors. </p><p>The issues surrounding screening for CHD will be reviewed here, with particular emphasis on the effectiveness of available screening methodologies. Screening for CHD in patients with diabetes, generally a higher-risk population, is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-coronary-heart-disease-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for coronary heart disease in patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE FOR SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advanced obstructive coronary heart disease (CHD) can exist with minimal or no symptoms, with manifestations that can progress suddenly <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rapidly. The first clinical manifestation of CHD, acute myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina, or sudden cardiac death, is often associated with significant morbidity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The rationale for early detection of CHD is that detection during the subclinical stages of disease might permit the reliable identification of subjects at increased risk of an adverse cardiac event and that appropriate therapy (eg, lipid lowering) might improve the prognosis of those at high risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Other rationales for screening include certain high-risk occupations (eg, pilots, bus drivers, etc) where an acute cardiac event could endanger large numbers of people, or individuals with higher perceived risk of CHD who are beginning an exercise program. Although screening can identify patients with CHD at increased risk, there is a paucity of evidence that such screening actually improves outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H63114685\" class=\"local\">'Intervening following screening'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520970417\"><span class=\"h2\">Purpose of screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary purpose of screening for CHD is to identify patients whose prognosis could be improved with an intervention (in this case, medical therapy for risk factors or coronary revascularization). Screening for CHD should be distinguished from estimation of risk for CHD (or overall cardiovascular disease [CVD]). By definition, both are performed in asymptomatic persons, and both aim to improve outcomes with interventions, if indicated. However, screening for CHD (or CVD) identifies existing disease, while estimating the risk of CHD (or CVD) does not directly identify existing disease but rather the likelihood of any future event related to CHD (or CVD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-our-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Our approach&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The results of testing (screening or symptom-based) need to be interpreted in the setting of the likelihood of preexisting disease (ie, pretest probability). The pretest probability of CHD has, for decades, been based on patient age, gender, and typicality of anginal symptoms and was validated using invasive coronary angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. More recent data derived from coronary computed tomography angiography raise the likelihood, however, that the long-established estimates of pretest probability lead to overestimation of risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Additional data will be required to better define the pretest probability of CHD. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349915818\"><span class=\"h2\">Bayesian considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Understanding the theory of conditional probability (Bayes' theorem) as applied to medical decision making is critical to understanding the utility of testing for the diagnosis of CHD in asymptomatic individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Knowledge of the pretest probability of disease, along with the sensitivity and specificity of the tests performed, is necessary to determine the predictive value of the testing performed. This is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glossary-of-common-biostatistical-and-epidemiological-terms#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glossary of common biostatistical and epidemiological terms&quot;, section on 'Measures of diagnostic test performance'</a>.)</p><p>The pretest likelihood of CHD in a population with certain characteristics influences the posttest risk of having CHD. A positive result is likely to be a true positive result (ie, a low false positive rate) in a population with a high pretest risk for CHD, while a negative test is likely to be falsely negative (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50189\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50189 \">figure 1</a>). Conversely, in a population with a low pretest risk for CHD, a positive test is only weakly correlated with the presence of CHD (ie, has a high false positive rate), while a negative test is highly predictive of the absence of CHD. The stress test result (positive versus negative) has the greatest impact to differentiate high versus low posttest probability of disease in a population with an intermediate pretest probability of disease. Thus, the probability of CHD following a test is directly related to the specific population evaluated and the results of the test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99485079\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By definition, screening for a medical condition takes place in asymptomatic persons without a history of the disease in question. While most adults (age 20 years or older) should be periodically evaluated for cardiovascular risk factors and undergo a risk assessment for CHD risk, very few patients are actually screened for coronary heart disease (CHD). Testing in low-risk subjects can add to the costs of care without significant benefit, and positive studies in low-risk patients are more likely to be false positives and can lead to unnecessary tests and procedures. Conversely, testing in asymptomatic persons with a high estimated CHD risk (who are already candidates for primary prevention with guideline-directed medical therapies) is unlikely to lead to incremental benefit, as negative studies in such high-risk patients are more likely to be false negatives. (See <a href=\"#H349915818\" class=\"local\">'Bayesian considerations'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99485408\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most asymptomatic patients undergo a periodic health maintenance examination as part of their routine care which includes a focused history and physical examination; along with this, an estimate of the short- and long-term risk of CHD should be performed. The history and physical examination will rarely provide diagnostic evidence of CHD, but will identify symptomatic patients who require further evaluation for CHD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-care-in-adults-strategies-for-prioritization-and-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive care in adults: Strategies for prioritization and delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>History</strong> &ndash; Questions should focus on detection of angina or anginal equivalent symptoms as well as an assessment of lifestyle factors, including the level of regular exercise and overall fitness, dietary choices, smoking, and intake of alcohol or illicit drugs. If symptoms (eg, angina, dyspnea) are identified, screening is not indicated, but the patient should undergo evaluation for the cause of symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Family history</strong> &ndash; A family history of premature atherosclerotic disease or sudden cardiac death is often associated with an increased risk of CHD in the patient being screened. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of established risk factors for cardiovascular disease&quot;, section on 'Family history'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Risk score calculation</strong> &ndash; While not providing a diagnosis of CHD, assessment of cardiovascular risk is important for determining primary prevention treatment strategies. A variety of risk scores have been developed and validated in different populations, with no single risk score being optimal for every patient. The approach to the estimation of cardiovascular risk in an asymptomatic patient is presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-risk-calculators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Risk calculators&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99485363\"><span class=\"h2\">Who should be screened?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to screening for CHD is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening does not apply to individuals with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or CVD risk equivalents; such individuals are known to be at high risk for recurrent CVD events and should be treated with appropriate secondary prevention measures.

Some patients, however, may require reassurance that they will be able to actively exercise; in such cases, we proceed with exercise electrocardiography (ECG) testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As an example of the utility of exercise ECG testing prior to beginning an exercise program, only 2 percent of 3617 asymptomatic, hypercholesterolemic men who underwent exercise ECG testing at baseline experienced an activity-related acute cardiac event during follow-up (average of 7.4 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Although the risk of a cardiac event was increased 2.6-fold in patients with clinically silent, exercised-induced ST-segment changes during submaximal exercise treadmill test (ETT) at study entry, only 11 of the 62 men who experienced an activity-related event had a positive ETT at entry (sensitivity 18 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Competitive athletes &ndash; Professional societies in both North America and Europe have published recommendations for pre-participation screening for young competitive athletes (those younger than 35 years of age). A full discussion of screening prior to participation in competitive athletics is presented separately.

In the absence of any mandated testing, our experts do not perform regular screening or routine pre-participation testing in these otherwise asymptomatic patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349915867\"><span class=\"h1\">AVAILABLE SCREENING TESTS AND THEIR USE IN ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of approaches to screening have been investigated, ranging from blood work to both noninvasive and invasive cardiac tests. None of the available tests has proven useful for screening large populations, although some tests may serve a role in specific populations. (See <a href=\"#H99485079\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H99485624\" class=\"local\">'Special populations'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349915874\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no available blood markers which can diagnose asymptomatic atherosclerosis and CHD. As such, we do not perform screening for CHD with blood tests. </p><p>While no blood markers have the ability to definitively diagnose CHD, many circulating biomarkers are associated with increased cardiovascular risk (eg, lipid levels, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], etc). Measurement of serum cholesterol levels is well-established as part of the assessment of cardiovascular risk, while measurement of other markers is more controversial. As an example, while some experts recommend the routine measurement of CRP at the time of cholesterol screening to be used in the overall assessment of cardiovascular risk, other experts prioritize the assessment of traditional risk factors and consider CRP primarily for those with intermediate cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The approach to biomarker measurement in assessment of cardiovascular risk is discussed in greater detail in other topics.

Gene expression testing has been shown to have a relatively high sensitivity and negative predictive value for CHD in symptomatic patients referred for stress testing, but it has not been evaluated in asymptomatic patients as a screening tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>].

In different epidemiologic studies, the presence of variably defined ECG abnormalities has increased the adjusted relative risk for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity by 1.5- to 2.5-fold (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54801\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54801 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

Ischemia detected by ambulatory monitoring does not necessarily correlate with the presence and extent of ischemia as determined by radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging. In one study, for example, the concordance for normalcy or abnormalcy between these tests was only 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

The major source of controversy concerns the predictive value of exercise ECG testing and its relation to the prior probability of disease in the population being tested. In a meta-analysis involving 24,074 patients from 147 studies of symptomatic patients who underwent exercise ECG testing and invasive coronary angiography, there was a wide variation in sensitivity and specificity; the mean sensitivity was 68 percent but ranged from 23 to 100 percent, and the mean specificity was 77 percent but ranged from 17 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This wide range reflected different criteria for a positive test and the fact that there was bias in patient selection in most of the published literature. (See <a href=\"#H349915818\" class=\"local\">'Bayesian considerations'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-diagnostic-tests#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluating diagnostic tests&quot;, section on 'Disease prevalence'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Screening exercise ECG testing was performed in more than 10,000 subjects who participated in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) and the Lipid Research Clinic's Coronary Primary Prevention Trial (LRCPPT); asymptomatic ischemia detected during baseline treadmill exercise testing predicted an increased risk of coronary events and cardiac death at 7- to 10-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].

However, for patients in whom CHD screening is being performed, CAC scoring and coronary CT angiography can directly identify the presence of atherosclerotic CHD, although neither test is able to provide functional information (ie, impaired blood flow resulting in ischemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There is associated radiation exposure with both CAC score and coronary CT angiography, although with state of the art techniques, the radiation exposure is typically less than that associated with radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging or invasive coronary angiography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-dose-and-risk-of-malignancy-from-cardiovascular-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation dose and risk of malignancy from cardiovascular imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electron beam or multidetector row computed tomography (EBCT and MDCT) can noninvasively detect and quantify CAC using serial thin section (3 mm) tomograms from the aorta through the apex of the heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Direct relationships have been established between coronary calcium as measured by EBCT or MDCT and histologic, ultrasonographic, and angiographic measures of coronary disease. These observations provide the rationale for the use of CAC scanning to screen for CHD in asymptomatic adults suspected of having or being at risk for coronary disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic and prognostic implications of coronary artery calcification&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In both men and women, CAC detected by EBCT is highly sensitive for the presence of &ge;50 percent angiographic stenosis but only moderately specific, although the sensitivity and specificity vary with the degree of CAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. In a study of 1764 symptomatic patients with suspected CHD, as the Agatston CAC score varied from &gt;20th percentile to &gt;75th percentile for age, the sensitivity fell from 97 to 81 percent in men and from 98 to 76 percent in women, but the specificity increased to 77 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Patients with no CAC had a probability of stenosis of less than 1 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The CAC score provides additional prognostic information to the Framingham risk score (and, presumably, most risk scores). The 2010 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACCF/AHA</span> guideline for assessment of cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic adults stated that low-risk adults &quot;should not undergo&quot; screening for CAC, although they did recommend a possible role for CAC screening in patients at low-to-intermediate risk and in patients with intermediate risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Subsequent to the 2010 guidelines, in a randomized trial of 2137 asymptomatic patients who were randomized to CAC scanning or no CAC scanning, followed by risk assessment using the Framingham Risk Score, patients in the group who underwent CAC scanning had greater CHD risk factor control without increased downstream medical testing compared with the group without CAC scanning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-and-prognostic-implications-of-coronary-artery-calcification\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic and prognostic implications of coronary artery calcification&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data suggest that CAC is also an excellent predictor of cerebrovascular disease as well as CHD in the primary prevention setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The FACTOR-64 trial, conducted between 2007 and 2014 in the United States, evaluated the extent and severity of coronary atherosclerosis using coronary CT angiography and provided specific treatment based on the CT results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-coronary-heart-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. FACTOR-64 included 900 asymptomatic patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes who were randomized to coronary CT angiography screening or no screening. After a mean follow-up of four years, there was no significant difference in the primary endpoint (composite of all-cause mortality, non-fatal MI, or unstable angina) following screening with coronary CT angiography (6.2 versus 7.6 percent without screening; HR 0.8; 95% CI 0.5-1.3).

Coronary angiography may be considered in select patients who require CHD screening if other screening modalities (ie, stress testing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> coronary CT angiography) have yielded nondiagnostic results. (See <a href=\"#H99485624\" class=\"local\">'Special populations'</a> above.)</p><p>While coronary angiography has long been considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; test for the detection of CHD, the risks of performing an invasive procedure in a patient who is otherwise asymptomatic are generally perceived to outweigh any potential benefits. Additionally, the clinical usefulness of identifying high-grade obstructive CHD lesions in predicting the future risk of coronary events is uncertain because arteriography does not assess the morphological and cellular characteristics of a lesion or its functional significance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">RECOMMENDATIONS FROM MAJOR SOCIETIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While recommendations vary regarding the optimal approach to screening for CHD, no professional society guideline or consensus statement advocates for universal screening.

Since positive tests in asymptomatic patients are often false-positives, a subsequent normal result on stress testing with imaging is generally considered more definitive and often used to exclude CHD.

Screening for CHD should be distinguished from estimation of risk for CHD (or overall cardiovascular disease [CVD]). By definition, both are performed in asymptomatic persons, and both aim to improve outcomes with interventions, if indicated. However, screening for CHD (or CVD) identifies existing disease, while estimating the risk of CHD (or CVD) does not directly identify existing disease but rather the likelihood of any future event related to CHD (or CVD). (See <a href=\"#H520970417\" class=\"local\">'Purpose of screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most asymptomatic patients undergo a periodic health maintenance examination as part of their routine care. A focused history and physical examination and collection of information on cardiac risk factors, along with an estimate of the short- and long-term risk of CHD, should be part of any screening for CHD. (See <a href=\"#H99485408\" class=\"local\">'History and physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For asymptomatic patients at low to intermediate risk, we do not routinely perform screening electrocardiograms, stress testing, coronary calcium scoring, or coronary angiography.

(See <a href=\"#H99485079\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H99485624\" class=\"local\">'Special populations'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-to-prevent-sudden-cardiac-death-in-athletes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening to prevent sudden cardiac death in athletes&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to screening for CHD in patients with diabetes is presented separately.
