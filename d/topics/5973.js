Caretakers may bring children to the emergency department or primary care provider for headaches that are more severe or have not responded to nonprescription medications. In one retrospective series from a busy children's hospital emergency department, 1 percent of visits were for a chief complaint of headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-evaluation-of-headache-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The terms &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; may be used to describe headaches. Primary headaches (ie, migraine, tension-type, or cluster headaches) are typically self-limited and diagnosed based on symptom profiles and patterns of headache attacks. Secondary headaches have identifiable etiologies. Although the vast majority of secondary headaches in children have benign etiologies (ie, viral infections), the goal of the emergent evaluation of children with headaches is to identify as a first priority those with serious or life-threatening causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-evaluation-of-headache-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In most patients, this task can be accomplished with a careful history and physical examination and occasional selected ancillary testing.</p><p>Headache can be the symptom of life-threatening complications for children with various underlying conditions (ie, those with immunodeficiencies who develop opportunistic infections or patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts that malfunction causing obstruction) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocephalus-in-children-management-and-prognosis#H3981094519\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydrocephalus in children: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>). Evaluation of headache in these children (which is often guided by specific protocols that include neuroimaging and consultation with a specialist) will not be discussed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of children who are evaluated emergently for headaches are diagnosed with viral illnesses or migraine headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-evaluation-of-headache-in-children/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]. This is similar to the causes of headache among children seen in primary care settings and adults seen in emergency departments (EDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-evaluation-of-headache-in-children/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. The challenge for the emergency clinician is to identify patients with secondary headaches who require urgent diagnosis and treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78979\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78979 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Life-threatening conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Life-threatening causes of headache are those that may result in brain injury or death from various mechanisms including inflammation, increased intracranial pressure, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoxia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with life-threatening infections as the cause of headache typically have other worrisome clinical features, such as altered mental status or focal neurologic findings.

In otherwise healthy children, Herpes simplex virus causes 10 to 20 percent of sporadic cases of encephalitis and is the only treatable pathogen in this condition. Infection with specific arthropod-borne viruses may be suggested by seasonal patterns (eg, Eastern equine encephalitis or West Nile virus) or recent travel.

Conditions that may be associated with CNS abscess formation include immunocompromise and congenital heart disease with right to left intracardiac shunting. Cerebral abscess and cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) are uncommon, but life-threatening, complications of orbital, sinus, ear, or dental infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-evaluation-of-headache-in-children/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

However, very few children evaluated in the emergency department (ED) for headache have brain tumors as the cause. In a large multicenter pediatric series describing children with brain tumors, 62 percent of patients had headaches at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-evaluation-of-headache-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In comparison, in a small prospective series, less than 3 percent of children presenting to the ED with headaches had newly diagnosed brain tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-evaluation-of-headache-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The early symptoms of brain tumors are often nonspecific and diagnosis may be delayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-evaluation-of-headache-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. At the time of diagnosis, the overwhelming majority of children with brain tumors as the cause have other symptoms in addition to headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-evaluation-of-headache-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Over 99 percent of children in the multicenter report and all of the children in the ED series had at least one other symptom or sign (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting,</span> visual disturbance, ataxia, or abnormal eye movements) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-evaluation-of-headache-in-children/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Intracranial hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intracranial hemorrhage is an uncommon, but life-threatening, cause of headache among children. Headache is rarely the sole manifestation of hemorrhage that occurs as the result of trauma (ie, epidural or subdural hematoma). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe traumatic brain injury in children: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Evaluation and diagnosis of abusive head trauma in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage (typically subarachnoid) can develop in association with an aneurysm, vascular malformation, coagulopathy, or hemoglobinopathy. In one retrospective series that described children with nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage, more than half presented with headache and vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-evaluation-of-headache-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Frequent signs included hemiparesis and seizures. Among patients with sickle cell disease, intracranial hemorrhage accounts for about one third of cerebrovascular events.

Hypertensive encephalopathy is uncommon among children and is typically caused by systemic illness or renovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-evaluation-of-headache-in-children/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Pheochromocytoma is an exceptionally rare pediatric tumor that usually presents with headache and hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-evaluation-of-headache-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Migraine headaches are typically chronic and remitting, with characteristic patterns that are easily described by patients or parents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50876\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50876 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-evaluation-of-headache-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Tension-type headaches occur in 10 to 25 percent of school children and adolescents, making them as common as migraine headaches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68064\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68064 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-evaluation-of-headache-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Among children, they appear to be associated with depression, oromandibular dysfunction, and muscle tension due to stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-evaluation-of-headache-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In contrast to headaches related to brain tumors, pain is typically intermittent and recurring (but nonprogressive) and the neurologic examination is unremarkable.

Children typically report increased pain while chewing and have point tenderness over the mandibular condyle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-evaluation-of-headache-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Headache occurs more frequently among older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-evaluation-of-headache-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Idiopathic intracranial hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) have papilledema, increased intracranial pressure with normal cerebrospinal fluid content, normal neuroimaging, the absence of neurologic signs except cranial nerve VI palsy, and no known cause. Headache is the most common chief complaint among children who are old enough to describe their symptoms. Although IIH has been described in young children, most patients are adolescents and typically female.

However, they have been reported in children as young as three years and must be included in the differential diagnosis of primary headaches. These headaches are always unilateral and usually frontal-periorbital in location. The pain of cluster headaches is severe and lasts less than three hours.

For most other children requiring emergent evaluation for acute headache, the combination of history and physical findings, with selective laboratory testing and neuroimaging, generally identifies those with significant underlying conditions (eg, meningitis or intracranial pathology) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-evaluation-of-headache-in-children/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>].</p><p>The neurologic examination and approach to neuroimaging in children are reviewed separately.

This was demonstrated in one prospective study describing children evaluated in an emergency department (ED) for headache in which 98 percent of children selected the most severe rating on a pain scale to describe the severity of their headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergent-evaluation-of-headache-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Children with upper respiratory infections were more likely to be able to describe the quality of headache pain than those with brain tumors and ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt malfunctions. When able to describe the headache, the following characteristics are helpful in identifying an etiology:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Laterality: Unilaterality suggests migraine headache, although in children under age 10 years the pain in this condition may be bilateral. Also, unilateral headaches occur with focal infections, such as sinusitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Location: Cluster headaches are usually temporal or retro-orbital in location.
