This topic will discuss general principles of preanesthesia preparation, induction and maintenance of general anesthesia, and emergence from anesthesia for the healthy child undergoing routine surgery.</p><p>Induction and maintenance of general anesthesia for adults are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-induction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Induction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-anesthesia-maintenance-and-emergence\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General anesthesia: Maintenance and emergence&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H689032269\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>History and physical examination &mdash; </strong>All children should be evaluated with a preanesthesia medical history, review of systems, and an anesthesia directed physical examination. The preanesthesia evaluation is similar to that of an adult, with modifications appropriate for the child's stage of development, pediatric physiology, and family history. Important components of the preoperative history and physical examination for a child are shown in tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112116\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112116 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112117\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112117 \">table 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A preanesthesia airway evaluation, including assessment of predictors of difficulty with airway management, should be performed in children, as it would be for adults, with particular attention to findings which may be associated with difficult intubation, such as reduced thyromental distance (micrognathia), decreased mouth opening, reduced neck mobility, or large tongue. The components of the airway examination for children are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112117\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112117 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia#H717871122\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway management for induction of general anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Airway assessment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-management-for-induction-of-general-anesthesia#H717871210\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway management for induction of general anesthesia&quot;, section on 'Prediction of the difficult airway'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laboratory assessment &mdash; </strong>Preoperative laboratory testing should be individualized, based on patient factors and institutional norms. Routine laboratory studies are usually not required in healthy children. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Hematologic testing &mdash; </strong>Preoperative hemoglobin testing is unnecessary for most healthy children, and is not likely to yield useful information. In one study, routine hemoglobin testing found previously undetected anemia in only 0.29 percent of children scheduled for elective day surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Infants under four months of age may have physiological anemia and be at their postnatal hemoglobin nadir, but hemoglobin is rarely less than 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. This level of anemia is not likely to delay surgery or affect outcome for the procedures commonly performed for young infants, such as inguinal hernia repair. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">A complete blood count (CBC) should be measured preoperatively in children with chronic illnesses associated with anemia such as cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and those who are taking drugs that may affect blood cell production (eg, anticonvulsants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">valproate</a>). CBC and coagulation studies should be performed in patients with a suspected, known, or a family history of bleeding disorders, prior to surgery that is likely to result in significant bleeding, such as <span class=\"nowrap\">tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy,</span> cleft palate repair, and intracranial procedures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Electrolytes &mdash; </strong>Preanesthesia measurement of electrolytes is rarely necessary in healthy children, but should be performed in children with renal insufficiency, endocrine disorders, in those taking diuretics, or in children with history of <span class=\"nowrap\">vomiting/diarrhea,</span> and those who have limited fluid intake because of enteral feedings. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Pregnancy testing &mdash; </strong>Preoperative pregnancy testing for menarchal females, including adolescents, is controversial. A small percentage of young women may present for elective procedures with an unsuspected pregnancy, and history alone may be unreliable for predicting possible pregnancy in teenagers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The prevalence of a positive preoperative pregnancy test in adolescents has been reported to be 0.5 to 1.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Elective procedures that require anesthesia are avoided during pregnancy, because of the risks of surgery, anesthesia, and ionizing radiation for the pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The American Society of Anesthesiologists Practice Advisory for Preanesthesia Evaluation states that preanesthesia pregnancy testing may be offered to females of childbearing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, teenagers are often uncomfortable discussing sexual activity or the possibility of pregnancy, and may be unable to rationally choose whether to undergo pregnancy testing. Therefore, in many institutions, including the authors', all female patients &gt;12 years of age, and menarchal females &lt;12 years of age who undergo anesthesia or sedation are required to have a urine human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test performed on the day of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Routine pregnancy testing raises potentially difficult ethical, confidentiality, and consent issues. Positive testing may be best handled with the assistance of a social worker, child life, or mental health professional. </p><p/><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient selection for outpatient anesthesia &mdash; </strong>Surgical procedures are increasingly performed on an outpatient, or ambulatory, basis. Postoperative admission to the hospital may be required because of the surgical procedure (eg, major abdominal or orthopedic surgery, cardiac surgery), or specific patient clinical conditions. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Healthy patients</strong> &mdash; Healthy patients, or those with chronic disease under good control (ie, American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] physical status 1 or 2) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F87504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87504 \">table 3</a>) are usually appropriate candidates for ambulatory surgery. Some states mandate a minimum age for surgery at ambulatory surgical facilities (eg, Pennsylvania &ge;6 months), but younger infants may have ambulatory surgery at hospitals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Obstructive sleep apnea</strong> &mdash; Patients with significant obstructive sleep apnea (especially those less than three years of age) are at significant risk for airway obstruction and desaturation after adenotonsillectomy; these patients should have inpatient monitoring after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-tonsillectomy-with-or-without-adenoidectomy-in-children#H27780635\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy in children&quot;, section on 'Postoperative care'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Ex-premature infants</strong> &mdash; Ex-premature infants (born before 37 weeks gestation) are at risk for apnea after anesthesia or sedation. This risk decreases with increasing postmenstrual age (PMA) (ie, gestational age plus chronological age) with minimal risk between 56 and 60 weeks postconception. Ex-premature infants may require recovery room level of care overnight after anesthesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-ex-premature-infants-and-children#H19361580\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for ex-premature infants and children&quot;, section on 'Postoperative monitoring'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Neonates &mdash; </strong>Most institutions require inpatient observation after anesthesia for infants &le;44 weeks PMA, since full term infants may be at risk for apnea after anesthesia in the first few weeks of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1944494325\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT AND PARENT PREPARATION FOR ANESTHESIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preparation for pediatric anesthesia involves the patient, and in most cases the parent as well.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preoperative education &mdash; </strong>Both the patient and the family often experience stress and anxiety in anticipation of surgery. Preprocedural education and preparation may reduce anxiety, and improve compliance on the part of the patient with induction of anesthesia. Effective educational materials and methods include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>], which are used by the authors:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Online teaching modules or videos</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Books or other printed material </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Child life interventions (modeling, play therapy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Virtual or in person operating room tour</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Risks of anesthesia &mdash;</strong> In our experience, most parents are more concerned about the risks of anesthesia for their children than the risks of surgery. Anesthesia in healthy children is very safe, and is associated with low risks of serious complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Postoperative nausea and vomiting</strong> &mdash; The most common adverse events in the perioperative period in children include nausea and vomiting, as is true in adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-nausea-and-vomiting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative nausea and vomiting&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Perioperative respiratory adverse events &mdash; </strong>Perioperative respiratory adverse events (PRAE) are more common in children than adults, and are of greater concern. PRAEs include laryngospasm, bronchospasm, coughing, and oxygen desaturation, which occur most commonly during anesthetic induction and emergence. These events are more likely in children &lt;2 years of age, especially those with a recent upper respiratory infection or asthma, but they can occur in any child. One goal for anesthetic management for children should be the prevention of PRAEs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-child-with-asthma-or-recurrent-wheezing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the child with asthma or recurrent wheezing&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-child-with-a-recent-upper-respiratory-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the child with a recent upper respiratory infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Anesthetic neurotoxicity &mdash; </strong>The effect of anesthesia and surgery on the developing brain is an area of active research and interest. In December, 2016 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced warnings about potential risks of negative effects on the developing brain from administration of anesthetics and sedative drugs to pregnant women and children under age three, especially for repeated exposures or procedures lasting more than three hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the labeling change is recommended based on evidence from animal and not human studies. The degree of risk remains unclear, and the best available evidence suggests that a single, brief exposure to anesthesia does not cause neurotoxicity in healthy young children. The effects of anesthesia and surgery on the brain in young children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurotoxic-effects-of-anesthetics-on-the-developing-brain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurotoxic effects of anesthetics on the developing brain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery#H729730872\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the pregnant patient undergoing nonobstetric surgery&quot;, section on 'Fetal brain development'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Mortality &mdash; </strong>Mortality related to anesthesia is very rare in healthy children (likely <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;1/200,000</span> anesthetics), as it is in adults, though the true incidence is unclear. Perioperative cardiac arrest and mortality are more common during cardiac surgical procedures, in patients with significant comorbidities, and in infants and neonates. Data regarding the incidence of pediatric perioperative cardiac arrest and death come from prospective and retrospective reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>] and registry studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], with small numbers of events, and heterogeneity of patient populations and procedures. In one review of almost 93,000 pediatric anesthetics between 1988 and 2005 at a tertiary center, mortality for children who underwent noncardiac procedures was 1.6 per 10,000 anesthetics, compared with 115.5 per 10,000 anesthetics for cardiac procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Most cardiac arrests (88 percent) occurred in patients with congenital heart disease, and the majority of cardiac arrests were caused by factors unrelated to anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preanesthesia fasting &mdash;</strong> Oral intake is routinely restricted before anesthesia, in an attempt to reduce gastric contents and therefore the risk of aspiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94641\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94641 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-fasting-guidelines#H466491516\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative fasting guidelines&quot;, section on 'Fasting recommendations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-fasting-guidelines#H1428987\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative fasting guidelines&quot;, section on 'Pediatric patients'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Prolonged preoperative fasting can increase anxiety, and can cause hypovolemia and hypoglycemia, especially in infants and young children. Clear liquids should be encouraged in young children up to two hours prior to anesthesia, and parents should receive specific instructions on which liquids are acceptable (ie, water, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oral rehydration solutions</a>, clear fruit juices without pulp, carbonated beverages, clear tea, and black coffee). Necessary medications should be administered with a sip of water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We instruct patients to not take angiotensin receptor blockers on the day of surgery, since in our experience, these medications can cause intraoperative hypotension that is difficult to treat. We also instruct patients to stop <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metformin</a> 24 to 48 hours prior to surgery, because of the incidence of lactic acidosis with fasting while taking metformin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prevention and treatment of preoperative anxiety &mdash; </strong>Anxiety and distress in the immediate preoperative period may be prevented or relieved with a variety of techniques, including premedication, distraction techniques, and parental presence. Practice varies among institutions; we routinely premedicate pediatric patients. Unrelieved anxiety associated with anesthetic induction may result in a stormy induction requiring physical restraint of a crying, struggling child. Anxiety during induction may be associated with postprocedure behavioral changes including nightmares, separation anxiety, and aggression toward authority [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].<sup> </sup></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Sedatives and anxiolytics &mdash; </strong>Premedication reduces anxiety, improves compliance with induction, may provide amnesia for the induction, and may reduce postoperative negative behavioral changes during the first postoperative week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Premedication is more effective than either parental presence at induction or preoperative teaching programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

It is usually administered approximately 20 minutes prior to induction. Midazolam potentiates the respiratory depressant effects of opioids, and should be avoided or used with caution in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.

For very short procedures, such as quick upper endoscopy, deep inhalation anesthesia by facemask may be used, with brief removal of the mask for the procedure, or total intravenous anesthesia with face mask ventilation.

Hypotension in the healthy pediatric patient during anesthesia is often fluid-responsive (with a 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> bolus of normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution), and may be less likely to require vasopressor administration than in sicker or older patients. Intravenous fluid should be administered cautiously to children with cardiac or pulmonary disease. </p><p>Isotonic crystalloid intravenous solutions without dextrose (eg, normal saline, Ringer's lactate) should be administered intraoperatively. Similar to adults, large volume resuscitation with normal saline may cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in children. In children at risk for hypoglycemia (eg, infants under six months of age whose hepatic immaturity precludes effective gluconeogenesis or glycogenolysis, or those with metabolic disease), glucose-containing fluids should be available for correction of low blood sugar. Dextrose-containing fluids may also be administered as an infusion to maintain euglycemia if necessary, but should not represent the mainstay of maintenance or repletion fluid. &#160;</p><p>Blood loss should be monitored carefully. Children have blood volumes from 70 to 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span>. In very young children, seemingly small amounts of blood loss can cause significant hypotension. Iatrogenic hemodilution should be avoided, especially during the physiologic nadir for hemoglobin at three to six months of age. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2796474599\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to adults, children are increasingly ventilated using a lung protective strategy during anesthesia, including tidal volumes of approximately 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg,</span> low peak and plateau pressures, and modest positive end expiratory pressure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-during-anesthesia-in-adults#H3186383247\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation during anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Lung protective ventilation during anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p>The goal for oxygen saturation for neonates is lower than for older children and adults (90 to 94 versus &gt;95 percent), and the fraction of inspired concentration of oxygen should be set accordingly. This goal balances the need for adequate tissue oxygenation with concerns for the development reactive oxygen species. Hyperoxia has been implicated in retinopathy of prematurity, apoptosis, DNA injury, and end-organ inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-anesthesia-in-neonates-and-children-agents-and-techniques/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. </p><p>Ventilation should be set to maintain end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) between 35 and 40 mmHg. For the early neonate, significant hypercarbia and resultant respiratory acidosis may precipitate a treacherous reversion to fetal circulation. The rapid respiratory rate in children may cause a falsely low ETCO<sub>2</sub> reading, since inspiration may start before full expiration has occurred, stopping the rise of the ETCO<sub>2</sub> trace to its peak (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112454\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112454 \">figure 3</a>). The true ETCO<sub>2 </sub>can be determined by pausing the ventilator briefly to allow full exhalation to occur. </p><p>The differences between adult and infant respiratory physiology are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F112119\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112119 \">table 10</a>). Whereas weight based functional residual capacity and tidal volume are similar, minute ventilation and oxygen consumption are markedly higher in infants. This means that neonates and small infants desaturate quickly during apnea, and there is less time to take corrective action. The high chest wall compliance, and protuberant abdomens of young infants favor lung volume loss under anesthesia. As closing capacity can exceed functional residual capacity (FRC) in infants, maintenance of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is important to prevent atelectrauma. </p><p>Prior to the development of sophisticated flow meters in modern anesthesia machines, traditionally children were ventilated by pressure-driven modes, as very small tidal volumes were difficult to set and sense with accuracy. Pressure control ventilation with auto flow adjustment for changes in compliance is most commonly used. Such adjustments are particularly important during abdominal insufflation for laparoscopy, as in adults. The tidal volume is followed, and peak pressure or inspiratory time is increased if tidal volume falls. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-during-anesthesia-in-adults#H3076063010\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation during anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Pressure control with volume guarantee'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H370652826\"><span class=\"h2\">Temperature control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maintenance of normothermia during anesthesia is important in all patients, and is especially important in small children. Hypothermia has been associated with delayed emergence, altered pharmacokinetics, poor tissue perfusion, and potential reversion to transitional circulation in the neonate. In addition, vasoconstriction from hypothermia can make intravenous (IV) access particularly difficult in small children. </p><p>Infants and small children are at risk for hypothermia if exposed to cold environments for several reasons. The surface area to mass ratio of the infant is twice that of the adult, infants have thin skin and are unable to shiver to generate heat, and the relatively large head (ie, up to 20 percent of total skin surface area) may be a significant source of heat loss. </p><p>Forced air or water warming blankets and intravenous fluid warmers should be routinely used, and the patient should be kept covered as possible. The operating room temperature should be raised during skin preparation and before draping. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1307821356\"><span class=\"h2\">Regional anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regional anesthesia is increasingly used in pediatric anesthesia, either for postoperative pain control, or as the sole anesthetic.
