To diagnose female orgasmic disorder, the symptoms must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-orgasmic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Treatment for female orgasmic disorder consists principally of psychosocial interventions, though clinical trials of their efficacy are limited.</p><p>This topic discusses the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder. The treatment of female orgasmic disorder is discussed separately. The assessment of patients with sexual dysfunction is also discussed separately. The epidemiology, risk factors, evaluation, and an overview of treatment of women with sexual dysfunction are also discussed separately. The prevalence and management of sexual dysfunction due to serotonergic antidepressants are also discussed separately.

Most women require some degree of clitoral stimulation to experience orgasm. Indirect stimulation of the clitoris through vaginal intercourse may be sufficient to trigger orgasm in the majority of women, at least part of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-orgasmic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], whereas others may respond more readily and reliably to direct clitoral stimulation. Stimulation of other erotically sensitive areas (eg, breast or nipple stimulation) may trigger orgasm as well. Some women with complete spinal cord injury maintain the ability to experience orgasm through vaginal-cervical stimulation, a process that appears to be vagally mediated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-orgasmic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

The inability to do so is not a disorder, but rather a typical (and sometimes modifiable) variant of sexual response. </p><p>Recent data from population-based twin studies suggest that heritable factors may account for over 30 percent of variance in orgasmic frequency during intercourse and at least 45 percent of variance in orgasmic frequency with masturbation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-orgasmic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7344393\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychological and cultural factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Problems with orgasm in women are multifactorial and may be related to a variety of inhibitory psychosocial factors at the level of the individual, couple, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sociocultural context.

A period of sustained sexual activity is generally necessary in order to establish whether the problem is persistent or recurrent, although a pattern of orgasm difficulty with masturbation could meet this criterion.

Asking the woman to what extent she feels &ldquo;excited&rdquo; or &ldquo;turned on&rdquo; during sexual encounters can help establish her subjective perception of sexual arousal. It can be helpful for the clinician to inquire about the patient's experience of physical indicators of sexual arousal during sexual stimulation, such as genital warmth, tension, pulsing, and lubrication. If the woman appears to experience little or no sexual arousal with most sexual encounters, the diagnoses of female sexual arousal disorder <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoactive sexual desire disorder should be considered. </p><p>The clinician should assess whether the patient&rsquo;s symptoms have been life-long or acquired. When acquired female orgasmic disorder is suspected, it is important to compare feelings of arousal to the previous state of functioning.</p><p>The clinician should investigate whether the patient&rsquo;s symptoms are situational or generalized. It is common for women to report experiencing orgasm through self-stimulation but not during partnered sexual activity. This alone does not necessarily establish the presence of situational female orgasmic disorder, since partnered sexual activity may not be sufficiently arousing, or the problem may not be sufficient to cause distress in this context. If orgasm problems are limited to one particular partner but not past partners, careful assessment may reveal interpersonal problems or concerns about the pattern of sexual activity in the relationship. Alternatively, the partner may lack sexual knowledge and skills. The clinician should be sensitive to the possibility that a patient may find it less threatening to take on the label of &ldquo;dysfunctional&rdquo; than to describe problems with the partner or the relationship</p><p>Anxiety or inhibition related to sexuality can be assessed by inquiring about the frequency of self-monitoring during sexual activity, the woman&rsquo;s level of comfort in discussing sexual topics with her partner, and her perception of her own body, especially her genitals. Observing the woman&rsquo;s speech and behavior (eg, marked avoidance of language referring to genitals or sexual behaviors) may also provide evidence of general discomfort with sexuality. Further assessment may include queries about sexual mores and values in the woman&rsquo;s family of origin, which may reveal negative attitudes or a lack of knowledge about sexuality.</p><p>Assessment needs to determine whether the woman is anorgasmic despite the presence of a &ldquo;normal sexual excitement phase.&rdquo; This requires careful investigation of the woman&rsquo;s degree of sexual interest and arousal. The absence of an orgasm is an expected consequence of a sexual encounter that is not arousing. Despite this, sexual arousal is easy to overlook in the course of a clinical interview. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Female sexual response cycle'</a>.)</p><p>Women in intimate relationships sometimes bring their partners to a clinical assessment. Interviewing the couple jointly can yield valuable data about how the partners communicate, solve problems together, and show affection. The woman should ideally be interviewed alone at some point during the assessment so that private thoughts and feelings can be shared candidly. As an example, the woman may feel uncomfortable talking about her lack of sexual knowledge in the presence of her partner, or she may have difficulty voicing her sexual frustrations and wishes. Some material may be &ldquo;taboo&rdquo; within the couple; for instance, a woman who fantasizes about another person to achieve orgasm is unlikely to admit this in the presence of her partner. How best to handle such private information should be agreed upon by all parties at the beginning of the assessment.</p><p>It is important to inquire about the impact of the problem on the woman&rsquo;s life and the nature of her concern. Most women seeking treatment for a sexual problem are significantly distressed In some cases, the woman may not be distressed by the absence of orgasm itself, but by it causing her to worry about whether she is &ldquo;normal.&rdquo; Female orgasmic disorder should only be diagnosed in women who experience marked distress or interpersonal difficulty due to absent or delayed orgasm. </p><p>The woman&rsquo;s partner may look upon her lack of orgasm as a reflection of his or her own desirability or competence as a lover. In these instances, a diagnosis is not necessarily appropriate, particularly if the woman does not otherwise perceive her response as problematic. In this case, the issues should be reframed as an opportunity to educate the woman and her partner about typical variations in sexual response. </p><p>Measures of genital sensory function, such as tactile, vibratory, and temperature perception thresholds, appear to show some correlation with orgasmic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-orgasmic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]; however, they lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for use in detecting problems with orgasm in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-orgasmic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p>A medical work-up may be useful if the patient experiences a relatively sudden, generalized, and persistent loss of orgasmic response in the absence of other obvious causal factors. A physical exam can also rule out causes of genital discomfort or dyspareunia that contribute to sexual difficulties. The medical evaluation of women with sexual dysfunction is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2217236340\"><span class=\"h2\">Rating Scales</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although validated self-report questionnaires are not sufficient to establish a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder, they can help establish the frequency and severity of symptoms and can be used to monitor treatment response over time. It is generally helpful to assess multiple domains of sexual function to understand how different sexual problems (such as low sexual arousal or sexual pain) that may contribute to difficulties with orgasm. For assessment of patients with female orgasmic disorder, we favor use of the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-orgasmic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], a brief, clinically feasible, and psychometrically robust measure. The FSFI consists of 19 items covering six domains of functioning, including a three-item orgasmic function domain. Scores can be generated for individual domains and for overall sexual function. In previous research, domain and total FSFI scores discriminated reliably between women with and without sexual problems, including female orgasmic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-orgasmic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. For women involved in a long-term relationship with a sexual partner, assessment of general functioning within the intimate relationship can be collected self-report measures such as the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-orgasmic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>] which has been validated in both opposite-sex and same-sex couples and used in a number of studies of sexual function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-orgasmic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1279756854\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12710883\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DSM-5 criteria for female orgasmic disorder are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-orgasmic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A.

These effects may be due to anti-dopaminergic properties and induced hyperprolactinemia. Second-generation antipsychotics appear less likely to cause these side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-orgasmic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>].

Long-term orgasmic capacity is usually unaffected by routine pelvic surgeries, including simple hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-orgasmic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. More radical pelvic surgeries and pelvic radiotherapy have greater potential to disrupt orgasmic functioning for a longer period of time compared to routine pelvic surgeries. As an example, long-term survivors of vaginal and cervical cancers report orgasmic problems at about twice the rate of women in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-orgasmic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

As an example, a diagnosis of depression is associated with a loss of interest in sex, which may lead to secondary orgasmic dysfunction. Population-based studies have found that depression is a risk factor for orgasm problems in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-orgasmic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], although it is unclear whether this reflects the widespread use of antidepressant medication. Anxiety that distracts the woman from attending to sexual stimulation (eg, uncontrollable worry) or creates psychological discomfort with sexual stimulation (eg, contamination fears) may also contribute to problems with orgasm. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7344456\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female orgasmic disorder is characterized by a persistent or recurrent delay in or absence of orgasm following sexual arousal and adequate sexual stimulation, with the symptoms causing marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.
