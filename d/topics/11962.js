The fundamentals of nutrition support for critically ill patients will be reviewed here, including the goals, outcomes, indications, contraindications, and daily nutritional requirements. Access, formulations, prescribing, monitoring, and complications of enteral and parenteral nutrition are discussed separately.

Although outcomes have not been adequately studied in randomized trials, the primary goal of nutrition support is to alter the course and outcome of the critical illness. Major goals are determined by the following principles:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute critical illness is traditionally thought to be characterized by catabolism exceeding anabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. However, with better management of ventilatory failure, fever, anxiety, and pain, calorie consumption, as measured by calorimetry, has been dramatically reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carbohydrates are believed to be the preferred energy source during this period because fat mobilization is impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The basis of protein prescriptions is the hope for mitigation of the breakdown of muscle proteins into amino acids, which then serve as the substrate for gluconeogenesis, as reflected in a favorable nitrogen balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This remains theoretical, as the results of studies have been contradictory. While supplementary protein is still recommended for critically ill patients, there is growing concern that overprescription of protein may have detrimental impact on outcomes overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The phase of recovery which begins as critical illness resolves is characterized by anabolism exceeding catabolism. Nutrition support provides substrate for the anabolic state, during which the body corrects hypoproteinemia, repairs muscle loss, and replenishes other nutritional stores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enteral and parenteral nutrition appear to impact clinical outcomes differently in critically ill patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2782159\"><span class=\"h2\">Adequately nourished patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the evidence related to nutrition support is from patients who are adequately nourished when they enter the study, since clinical trials have typically excluded patients with malnutrition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H935222\"><span class=\"h3\">Enteral nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enteral nutrition may decrease the incidence of infection in critically ill patients if provided early in the course of critical illness, although data are conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-16</a>]. This effect has been demonstrated in clinical trials that compared patients who received early enteral nutrition to patients who received either delayed enteral nutrition or intravenous fluids only. Early and delayed have been variably defined in clinical trials but, roughly speaking, early enteral nutrition is initiated within 48 hours and delayed enteral nutrition is initiated later.</p><p>An initial meta-analysis of three randomized trials (133 patients) found a non-statistically significant reduction in the incidence of infectious complications among patients who received early enteral nutrition (25 versus 41 percent, relative risk 0.66, 95% CI 0.36-1.22) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In an unpublished update of the meta-analysis, seven randomized trials (440 additional patients) were added and the reduction in the incidence of infectious complications became statistically significant (43 versus 58 percent, relative risk 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These meta-analyses are limited by the methodological flaws of the included randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The mechanisms by which enteral nutrition decreases infectious complications are unknown. However, preservation of gut immune function and reduction of inflammation have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Whether early enteral nutrition decreases mortality in critically ill patients is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/12,17,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,17,21,22</a>]. In a meta-analysis of eight randomized trials (317 patients) that compared early enteral nutrition to either delayed enteral nutrition or intravenous fluids, there was a non-statistically significant mortality reduction among the patients who received early enteral nutrition (6 versus 15 percent, relative risk 0.52, 95% CI 0.25-1.08) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In an unpublished update of the meta-analysis, 14 randomized trials (670 additional patients) were added [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The reduction of mortality was almost statistically significant (10 versus 20 percent, relative risk 0.68, 95% CI 0.46-1.01). However, a randomized trial of 78 critically ill patients was stopped early due to greater mortality in patients receiving very early (within six hours of hemodynamic stability) and aggressive (&gt;75 percent of goal) enteral nutrition compared with patients who received standard nutritional support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. &#160;</p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 prospective randomized trials that compared early enteral nutrition to either no enteral nutrition or delayed enteral nutrition, reported that the benefit of early enteral nutrition could be attributed to the effect of risk of bias within the studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].&nbsp;Thus, the benefits of early feeding in this population may be overestimated. Nonetheless, in balance, the evidence supports a clinically important and statistically significant reduction in infection when enteral nutrition is administered early to critically ill patients, as well as a clinically important and almost statistically significant reduction in mortality. We believe that the potential benefit of early enteral nutrition outweighs the likelihood of harm and that it should be prescribed for most critically ill patients who do not have contraindications to enteral feeding. We recognize that the evidence for this approach is higher quality for patients with surgical problems than medical problems: surgical patients (eg, trauma, peritonitis, pancreatitis, and burns) were the focus of the randomized trials and meta-analyses described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/12,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,17</a>], whereas medical patients have primarily been studied in observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24</a>].</p><p>While early enteral nutrition appears to have benefit, there are data from randomized studies that suggest that attempting to achieve 100 percent of estimated caloric goals in the first week of critical illness may be harmful. Therefore, the goal should be the initiation of enteral nutrition within 48 to 72 hours of entry into the intensive care unit (ICU), but should <strong>not</strong> be the aggressive provision of goal calories and protein within the first week of critical illness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-enteral-nutrition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Enteral nutrition&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H935231\"><span class=\"h3\">Parenteral nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The provision of early parenteral nutrition (up to 48 hours from start of critical illness or surgery) to patients with absolute or relative contraindications to enteral nutrition does not alter mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. Additionally, there is no consistent evidence in critically ill patients suggesting that early parenteral nutrition improves the number of ventilator-free days or length of stay in the ICU or hospital. In balance, evidence suggests that early parenteral nutrition in well-nourished critically ill patients, whether given as the sole therapy or supplemental to enteral nutrition, does not reduce mortality and may be associated with an increased risk of nosocomial infections. The optimal time for starting parenteral nutrition in critically ill patients is unknown. However, based upon this data, we typically do not start feeding parenterally before one to two weeks.</p><p>Evidence suggests early parenteral nutrition may increase the risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/25-27,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27,29</a>].

In clinical practice, however, malnutrition may exist at the time of admission or as a consequence of receiving little or no nutritional intake for an extended period (eg, two weeks) during the hospitalization. Importantly, the term malnutrition is somewhat confusing in that it includes both the impact of starvation and the catabolic effects (wasting, insulin resistance, hypoproteinemias, immune suppression) due to systemic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Nourishment strategies have no impact on the latter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], and studies have not been forthcoming in proving a mortality benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>We believe that enteral nutrition is beneficial to patients with prolonged periods of inadequate intake, since there is no controversy that chronic starvation is deleterious.

Additionally, the presence of malnutrition in obese patients may confound the effect of obesity on measured outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Some trials suggest that hypocaloric high protein regimens are associated with a trend toward reduced length of stay in this population without an effect on mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/37-42,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-42,45</a>]. In contrast, a large observational study reported mixed effect on 60-day mortality in those given a hypocaloric low protein diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

However, until the clinical impact of alternative diets is better elucidated, we suggest that nutritional support in the critically ill obese parallel that of the adequately nourished patient.

We recognize that the effects of parenteral nutrition in such patients are unknown; however, our rationale is that failure to treat the malnourishment will result in a progressive caloric deficit, which is associated with increased morbidity. Supplemental PN may be administered to patients receiving enteral nutrition but chronically unable to meet their needs by a significant margin. This, however, does not apply to patients during at least the first week of ICU care.

The terminology remains confusing as the syndrome of malnutrition includes both the consequences of starvation as well as the consequences of catabolic wasting. The former is malnourishment, the latter is not. Evidence that a patient has malnutrition includes poor nutritional intake accompanied by unintentional weight loss or low body weight. Sample criteria (arbitrarily chosen and not validated) include a BMI less than 18.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> the unintentional loss of more than 2.3 kg (5 lb) or 5 percent of body weight over one month, or the unintentional loss of more than 4.5 kg (10 lb) or 10 percent of body weight over six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Temporal muscle wasting, sunken supraclavicular fossae, decreased adipose stores, and signs of vitamin deficiencies may also be apparent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78426\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78426 \">table 1</a>). While such findings may be suggestive of starvation, they are just as likely to be a consequence of the catabolic effect of underlying illness. Nutritional surrogates, particularly serum proteins (eg, albumin, <span class=\"nowrap\">prealbumin/transthyretin)</span> are similarly susceptible to the effects of systemic inflammatory illness, and are not responsive to nutrient intake. While these identify patients with catabolic illness and at higher risk for medical and surgical complications and death, they should not be used to detect malnourishment in critically ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. A list of nutrients and clinical manifestations due to their excess or deficiency is available at: <a href=\"http://www.nal.usda.gov/wicworks/Topics/FG/AppendixC_NutrientChart.pdf&amp;token=Ss/nqehB74aqRJIspyxWldb6cKomwlUr41o5WD0VJi2qQrfhY3WHrRVx01PFYmhb6gyViDXjV9IFDyhmJx+spc75+5dsd53dzUidgEwQ1ms=&amp;TOPIC_ID=1617\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.nal.usda.gov/wicworks/Topics/FG/AppendixC_NutrientChart.pdf</a>.</p><p>It is assumed that malnutrition due to malnourishment is impending when there has been a prolonged period of poor nutritional intake. The precise duration necessary for malnourishment- or starvation-related malnutrition to develop is unknown and probably varies among patients. As a general guideline, it is reasonable to assume that starvation-related malnutrition is impending in any patient who has had little or no nutritional intake for two weeks. One week or less may be more accurate for patients with antecedent undernourishment, with the precise duration depending on the severity of the undernourishment. Inflammation-related malnutrition may develop indolently, as does starvation-related malnutrition, but may also develop far more quickly, in hours to days, depending on the severity of illness. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines discourage early enteral nutrition in critically ill patients who are both hemodynamically unstable and have not had their intravascular volume fully resuscitated, since such patients may be predisposed to bowel ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/36,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,52</a>]. Hemodynamic instability by itself, unless severe, is not a contraindication for enteral nutrition if there is evidence for adequate volume resuscitation and tissue perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Other contraindications to enteral nutrition include bowel obstruction, severe and protracted ileus, major upper gastrointestinal bleeding, intractable vomiting or diarrhea, severe hemodynamic instability, gastrointestinal ischemia, and a high output fistula.</p><p>Some conditions previously considered contraindications to enteral nutrition are no longer considered as such. Examples include hyperemesis gravidarum and the absence of bowel sounds or flatus following routine colorectal surgery or surgery for bowel perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/11,54-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,54-58</a>]. While such patients remain at increased risk for vomiting, enteral nutrition may confer an overall benefit since it may decrease the risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/11,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,57</a>]. In addition, a new gastrointestinal anastomosis distal to the infusion site that the surgeon feels is at risk of dehiscence was once considered a contraindication until more recent data indicated that early feeding strengthens anastomoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Contraindications to parenteral nutrition include hyperosmolality, severe hyperglycemia, severe electrolyte abnormalities, volume overload, inadequate IV access, and inadequate attempts to feed enterally. </p><p>Relative contraindications to parenteral nutrition are not well defined. However, parenteral nutrition is often avoided in sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, minor vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, short-term mechanical ventilation, and conditions expected to reverse quickly that temporarily preclude enteral feeding.</p><p>Enteral and parenteral nutrition must be initiated slowly and with strict monitoring in patients at risk for &ldquo;refeeding syndrome.&rdquo; Patients with chronic undernourishment should receive supplemental <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiamine</a> prior to initiation of artificial nourishment to prevent Wernicke syndrome.

Small trials have been performed, but their results are equivocal. Trials that compare the measurement of caloric or protein intake to the estimation of caloric or protein intake (eg, formulas, tables) are similarly unlikely to be performed. Thus, clinical decisions must be based upon observational evidence and clinical experience. </p><p>There is little consensus among clinicians regarding how to adjust energy requirements for critically ill obese patients. Adjustments can be made based upon an estimate of the individual&rsquo;s resting energy expenditure (REE) or their body weight. Indirect calorimetry and predictive equations can be used in this population to estimate the REE. Although most experts agree that indirect calorimetry is the best method for REE measurement, calorimeters are not widely available, calorie prescription based on calorimetry has not been adequately tested, and some patients do not meet valid testing criteria. Therefore, predictive equations are more commonly used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/45,60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,60,61</a>]. Alternatively, weight-based adjustments in the obese population can be performed as outlined below. Additional guidelines for the assessment of REE for critically ill patients can be found at the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (<a href=\"http://pen.sagepub.com/site/misc/Index/Clinical_Guidelines.xhtml&amp;token=rJcASFBSeJmG/sAhFGI1R5m+W7HX+tCP3tAzxFc0sKPhO/NgBgYZxadE+VPkt+5B0wq/5npROMzvqd3bwkXcU72b7/KLzhcNYtpmPrNn7T0=&amp;TOPIC_ID=1617\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ASPEN</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Dosing weight</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When prescribing enteral or parenteral nutrition, the appropriate body weight from which to calculate caloric and protein intake (ie, the dosing weight) must first be determined.</p><p>For patients who are underweight (body mass index [BMI] &lt;18.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>),</span> we suggest using the current weight as the initial dosing weight. The reason is that calculation of caloric intake based on ideal body weight could lead to the administration of excess initial calories and induce refeeding syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment#H252082\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eating disorders: Overview of prevention and treatment&quot;, section on 'Refeeding syndrome'</a>).

If neither expertise with this equation or calorimetry is available, we suggest that the dosing weight be adjusted. The purpose of adjusting the dosing weight of patients who are obese is to account for the absence of metabolic requirements by fat tissues:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most commonly employed method is to add 0.4 times the difference between the ideal body weight (IBW) and the actual body weight (ABW) to the IBW.

However, with improvement in mechanical ventilation, as well as pain, anxiety, and temperature control, the caloric expenditure of the critically ill will often not exceed resting energy expenditure. </p><p>In the past, providing fewer calories than needed to meet energy needs was controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>]. However, there has since been evidence that, in the first week of critical illness, this approach is not harmful and may have some benefits (eg, less gastrointestinal intolerance, fewer infections) such that it has become routine practice in most intensive care units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one randomized trial of 1000 mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung injury (EDEN), low calorie feeding (mean caloric intake 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day)</span> for the first six days, compared with full enteral feeding (mean caloric intake 1300 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day),</span> did not change ventilator-free days, 60-day mortality, or infectious complications, but was associated with less gastrointestinal intolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another randomized trial of 894 critically-ill patients (medical, surgical, trauma) (PermiT), compared with standard enteral feeding (70 to 100 percent of calculated caloric requirements), 14 days of permissive underfeeding (40 to 60 percent of the calculated caloric requirements with similar amounts of protein to the standard formula) was not associated with a difference in mortality, gastrointestinal intolerance, infectious complications, or length of hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

Attempting to achieve a goal of 25 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> of dosing weight per day after one week is reasonable for most stable patients. A goal of 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> per day is an acceptable goal if weight gain is desired in a relatively stable patient; weight gain should not be attempted until the patient is stable and in a lower inflammatory state. We keep the caloric goal at 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> per day or less if extubation is imminent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Protein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines indicate that protein requirements increase as illness becomes more severe. This is based solely on nitrogen excretion and not on outcomes studies except in burns. Practice is to give patients with only mild to moderate illness 0.8 to 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> protein per day. Critically ill patients are generally prescribed 1.2 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>] and patients with severe burns may benefit from as much as 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day.
