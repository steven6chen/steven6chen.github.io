Abnormalities include valvular and annular thickening and calcification of any of the heart valves but commonly the aortic and mitral valves, with the subsequent development of valvular regurgitation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stenosis of the affected valve.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREDISPOSING FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many predisposing factors are associated with the development of valvular disease in dialysis patients, perhaps the most significant being the presence of secondary hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Valvular calcification is also associated with an elevated calcium-phosphorus product, vascular calcification, hypercalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia, all findings that can occur in patients with marked secondary hyperparathyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Refractory hyperparathyroidism and indications for parathyroidectomy in dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Valvular calcification may also be found in patients without secondary hyperparathyroidism, particularly among those with adynamic bone disease, older patients, and those who have undergone dialysis for a longer duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The association with adynamic bone disease may be related to the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitriol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitriol</a> and calcium-containing phosphate binders, with increased calcium deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Progressive disease may be attenuated in part by substituting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevelamer-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevelamer</a> for calcium-containing phosphate binders, as shown in a trial of 200 hemodialysis patients followed over a one-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Additional factors that may enhance the development of valvular heart disease in this patient population include the presence of one or more of the following conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperlipidemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left ventricular hypertrophy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Malnutrition/inflammatory</span> complex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uremic milieu</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mitral valve prolapse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High cardiac output states</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infective endocarditis (IE)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arteriovenous (AV) fistulae</p><p/><p>The presence of valvular calcification is also a marker of generalized vascular calcification in patients with end-stage renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Vascular calcification in this patient population is discussed in detail separately.

The reported prevalence of MAC is approximately 8 to 15 percent, with significant increases commonly seen with advanced age, multiple cardiovascular risk factors, and chronic kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. MAC occurs in 10 to 50 percent of patients with end-stage renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/1,7,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,13,14</a>]. As previously mentioned, it is associated with an elevated calcium-phosphorus product, vascular calcification, hypercalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia.</p><p>MAC occurs earlier in patients with chronic kidney disease than those without renal dysfunction due in part to the dialysis procedure alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In one study, MAC was more common in younger (less than 60 years of age) than older dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Since older dialysis patients are commonly dialyzed for fewer years because of a marked increase in mortality, MAC appears to occur more frequently in those dialyzed for a longer period of time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-and-maintenance-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival and maintenance dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>MAC is recognized echocardiographically as a uniform echodense rigid band, located posterior to the mitral leaflet and anterior to the left ventricular wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It can extend along the endocardium of the posterior basal wall and engulf and immobilize the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic evaluation of the mitral valve&quot;, section on 'Mitral annular calcification'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Aortic valve calcification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aortic valve calcification (AVC) is found in 25 to 55 percent of hemodialysis patients, occurring 10 to 20 years earlier than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/2,6,7,13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,7,13-18</a>]. When adjusted for other cardiovascular risk factors, moderate chronic kidney disease is not significantly associated with AVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Furthermore, it has been shown that the prevalence and severity of AVC and coronary artery calcium (CAC) are increased among patients with atherosclerotic causes of renal failure and do not vary with the severity of kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>A study including 1964 participants from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort Study revealed that decreased renal function was associated in a dose-dependent manner with increased levels of AVC, independent of traditional risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>AVC is associated with factors similar to those associated with MAC. AVC occurs more frequently in hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis patients who are older, have received renal replacement therapy for a longer period of time, and in those with elevated serum parathyroid hormone, calcium, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> phosphorus levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/1-3,7,13,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,7,13,22-24</a>]. Other factors that promote the development of AVC include increasing age, enhanced mechanical stress on the valve cusps, minor congenital cusp inequalities, hypertension, inflammation, malnutrition, diabetes, and dyslipidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/2,5,19,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,19,25-27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347385325\"><span class=\"h2\">Combined valvular calcification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The co-occurrence of mitral valve and AVC has been reported in 15 to 29 percent of patients with end-stage renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/24,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,28,29</a>]. In one study that included 243 hemodialysis patients, calcifications were present in either the mitral valve, aortic valve, or mitral annulus in 100 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Fewer than 2 percent of dialysis patients had one site that was free of calcification, and more than 50 percent of patients had at least mild calcification. Mild to moderate mitral valve calcification (MVC) and AVC were reported in 98.8 and 94.8 percent of patients, respectively, exceeding previously documented prevalences. Mild MAC was found in 68.7 percent of patients, and moderate to severe MAC was found in 31.3 percent of patients. Other findings in this study included a significantly increased prevalence of moderate to severe AVC in patients aged &ge;65 years, men than women, and whites versus African Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Tricuspid and pulmonic valve calcification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The occurrence of calcific deposits in the tricuspid and pulmonic valve annulus is rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">VALVULAR THICKENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Valvular thickening or sclerosis, which most commonly involves the aortic and mitral valves, is a frequent finding in hemodialysis patients. Among such patients, aortic and mitral valve sclerosis occur in 55 to 69 and 40 to 60 percent of individuals, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>].</p><p>Although previously thought to be a nonspecific finding without clinical significance, valvular sclerosis is now recognized to be associated with progressive stenosis and increased cardiovascular mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Prospective studies have found that valvular sclerosis may progress, usually gradually, but occasionally rapidly, to clinically significant stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/2,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,32</a>]. In a Doppler echocardiographic study of 62 patients on hemodialysis, 34 had thickening of the aortic cusps; among these patients, eight had aortic stenosis, and eight had aortic regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Twenty-five patients had thickening of the mitral annulus; among these patients, seven had mitral regurgitation, and three had mitral stenosis.

On gross examination, the chordae tendineae show irregular thickening and shortening.

Infective endocarditis (IE), conduction abnormalities, and thromboembolism may also occur with these defects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of patients with valvular disease are similar in those with and without renal failure, but there are certain issues that are unique among dialysis patients. For example, valvular heart disease may be difficult to diagnose clinically via the physical examination because changing volume status makes the clinical assessment of murmurs difficult. Coexisting conditions, such as anemia and hypertension, also frequently exaggerate murmurs. In addition, valvular dysfunction may be associated with complications during hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-heart-sounds\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of heart sounds&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intradialytic hypotension in an otherwise stable patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another clinical issue related to volume status involves the presence of a diastolic murmur commonly heard in patients with end-stage renal disease. The exact origin of this murmur remains controversial. Although it was previously attributed to pericardial disease or aortic insufficiency, the murmur is now considered to arise from the pulmonic valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. Typically, the murmur is described as a diastolic, decrescendo murmur that is blowing in quality and occurs immediately after the second heart sound. The maximal intensity is at the left sternal border or sometimes at the apex. It is best heard in the supine position, typically disappears after dialysis, and reappears when the patient becomes volume overloaded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echocardiography with Doppler flow analysis is an invaluable diagnostic screening tool for the presence of valvular heart disease; it is the modality of choice to detect and assess valvular dysfunction in patients with and without renal failure. Echocardiography can also evaluate left ventricular function and pericardial disease. However, prior to performing echocardiography, the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines recommend that the dry weight should be optimized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic evaluation of the mitral valve&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Two-dimensional echocardiography permits a real-time evaluation of the anatomy of the valve, subvalvular structures, annulus, and other cardiac structures. Doppler flow analysis can also evaluate the degree of <span class=\"nowrap\">regurgitation/stenosis</span> and flow dynamics. In patients with known valvular heart disease, serial echocardiograms are recommended to follow the progression of disease.</p><p>Although echocardiography most commonly provides an accurate assessment of disease severity, cardiac catheterization may be necessary in patients with aortic stenosis or regurgitation, settings in which hemodynamic severity can be difficult to assess noninvasively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodynamics-of-valvular-disorders-as-measured-by-cardiac-catheterization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodynamics of valvular disorders as measured by cardiac catheterization&quot;</a>). Coronary angiography is principally needed to evaluate for coronary artery disease in patients who may undergo valve replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among dialysis patients, general therapeutic considerations for the treatment of valvular heart disease that are independent of the specific valvular defect should include the prevention and management of secondary hyperparathyroidism, hyperphosphatemia, hypercalcemia, increased <span class=\"nowrap\">calcium/phosphate</span> product, and hypertension. Prevention is particularly important since there are limited data to show that management after onset is effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/9,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,41</a>]; most investigators agree that the uremic milieu in association with other predisposing factors facilitate premature valvular heart disease and calcium deposition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertension-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertension in dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Type of valve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both bioprosthetic and mechanical valves, particularly in the dialysis patient, are at risk for endocarditis. Candidacy for long-term anticoagulation is also a factor in the clinical decision making in selecting a valve as it is required for all mechanical valves. However, accelerated dysfunction is common with bioprosthetic valves, while mechanical valves are associated with long-term function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-mechanical-prosthetic-valve-thrombosis-or-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis or obstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The optimal replacement valve (independent of the exact anatomic location) remains somewhat controversial in patients with end-stage renal disease. Many authors have traditionally favored a mechanical, not a bioprosthetic, valve. Features that support the use of a mechanical valve are the enhanced risks of accelerated dysfunction and calcification of a bioprosthetic valve due to the uremic milieu.</p><p>Bioprosthetic valves have been used in hemodialysis patients with relatively good short-term results (less than five years). This was illustrated in a retrospective study of nearly 6000 dialysis patients in which survival at two years was similar among those who underwent cardiac valve replacement with a mechanical or bioprosthetic valve (40 percent for both groups) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Another comparative study of hemodialysis patients in China found equivalent rates of perioperative morbidity and mortality and late survival (47) after cardiac valve replacement with a bioprosthetic versus mechanical valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Benefits with bioprosthetic valves include a lower incidence of bleeding, thrombosis, and stroke (both early and late events) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. A meta-analysis that examined the heart valve prosthesis selection in patients with end-stage renal disease found no difference in survival between bioprosthetic and mechanical prosthetic valve types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, as demonstrated in earlier studies, valve replacement with bioprosthesis was associated with fewer valve-related complications compared with mechanical prostheses. A single-center, retrospective study of 202 patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing valve replacement over a 12-year period found no difference in 30-day mortality (19.9 percent) between bioprosthetic and mechanical valve replacements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. However, 10-year survival was poor at 18 percent and was not influenced by the valve type implanted.</p><p>To improve specific patient survival, decrease morbidity, and reduce symptoms, the type of valve chosen should be individualized, with the decision based upon the age and clinical and functional status of the patient. Mechanical valves, particularly for the mitral valve, should be considered in younger and healthier patients; however, these individuals may be at a higher risk for bleeding and thrombotic complications. Careful consideration should be given in older patients, weighing such variables as the risk for bleeding, stroke, and the presence of hypercalcemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyperphosphatemia.</p><p>In general, both mechanical and bioprosthetic valves can be used in dialysis patients, as recommended in the 2005 KDOQI guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Delivery of dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether the delivery of intensive doses of dialysis prior to or during surgery improves outcomes is unknown.

Almost all patients (90 percent) with both valvular calcification and atherosclerotic vascular disease had died by one year, with death occurring in 21 and 23 percent of those with either abnormality alone and 13 percent of those with neither complication. A study of 144 adult hemodialysis patients found an increase in mortality for patients with valvular calcification of the mitral and aortic valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>] &#160; However, after adjustments for age, gender, race, diabetes mellitus, history of atherosclerotic disease, and pulse pressure, only mitral valve calcification (MVC) remained independently associated with all-cause mortality. Patients with calcification of both valves had a twofold increased risk of death compared with those without valvular calcification. Coronary and valvular calcification measured on chest computed tomography (CT) was also associated with all-cause mortality.</p><p>By contrast, in an Italian study of hemodialysis patients, the presence of calcifications was not an independent prognostic factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

Compared with patients without renal failure, the management of regurgitant lesions in dialysis patients, particularly mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, should focus upon volume and blood pressure control. Aortic regurgitation is also worsened in the setting of elevated systolic pressure and increased afterload conditions. Aggressive ultrafiltration to attain clinical dry weight and optimal blood pressure control (with antihypertensive medications, if necessary) should be therapeutic goals in these patients. The attainment of optimal intravascular volume may eliminate or severely reduce regurgitant valvular lesions, as well as diminish the clinical murmurs associated with these lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>However, more aggressive ultrafiltration does not always improve the clinical status of the patient.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Valvular heart disease is common in patients undergoing maintenance dialysis. Many predisposing factors are associated with the development of valvular disease in this population. These include secondary hyperparathyroidism, an elevated calcium-phosphorus product, vascular calcification, hypercalcemia, uremic milieu, hyperphosphatemia, and a host of other factors. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Predisposing factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among those with end-stage renal disease, mitral annular and aortic valve calcification (MAC and AVC) occur in 10 to 50 percent and 25 to 55 percent of patients, respectively. By comparison, the occurrence of tricuspid and pulmonic valvular calcification is rare. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Valvular and annular calcification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Valvular thickening or sclerosis of the aortic and mitral valve is a frequent occurrence in hemodialysis patients, occurring in 55 to 69 percent of individuals. Valvular sclerosis is associated with progressive stenosis and increased cardiovascular mortality. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Valvular thickening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical diagnosis of valvular heart disease is difficult by physical exam secondary to the changing volume status of dialysis patients, presence of anemia, and hypertension. Thus, echocardiography with Doppler flow analysis is an invaluable diagnostic screening tool for the presence of valvular heart disease. General therapeutic considerations that are independent of the specific valvular defect should encompass the prevention and management of secondary hyperparathyroidism, hyperphosphatemia, hypercalcemia, increased <span class=\"nowrap\">calcium/phosphate</span> product, and hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'General issues in valvular disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stenosis of the aortic valve is the most common obstructive abnormality among hemodialysis patients, with the next most frequent lesion being mitral stenosis. By comparison, tricuspid and pulmonic stenoses are rare. Although the clinical manifestations and treatment of aortic, mitral, pulmonary, and tricuspid stenosis are similar in patients with and without renal failure, certain features are relatively unique among patients undergoing maintenance dialysis. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Valvular stenosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high prevalence of mitral, tricuspid, and aortic regurgitation is observed in dialysis patients. The disappearance of regurgitant lesions with aggressive volume and blood pressure control suggests that most valvular insufficiency in dialysis patients is &quot;functional&quot; in origin, and aggressive ultrafiltration to attain clinical dry weight and optimal blood pressure control should be therapeutic goals in dialysis patients. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Valvular regurgitation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infective endocarditis (IE), arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, and thromboembolism are significant issues in dialysis patients with valvular abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Infective endocarditis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Additional complications'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/valvular-heart-disease-in-patients-with-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Forman MB, Virmani R, Robertson RM, Stone WJ.
