It can cause pain in the upper belly and other symptoms. Some women with HELLP also have high blood pressure and too much protein in their urine.</p><p>HELLP syndrome usually happens in the last 3 months of pregnancy. It can also happen earlier, or even right after pregnancy &ndash; 1 or 2 days after the baby is born.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15139991\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of HELLP syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain, especially in the middle or right upper belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling sick</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15140006\"><span class=\"h1\">How will HELLP syndrome affect my pregnancy and my baby?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HELLP syndrome can be dangerous for you and your baby. It can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Harm your blood cells, and your liver, kidneys, and other organs </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Harm your placenta &ndash; The placenta is the organ that brings the baby nutrients and oxygen and takes away waste. It might pull away from the uterus before your baby is born. If this happens, your baby might not get all the nutrients and oxygen he or she needs. The placenta pulling away can also cause heavy bleeding that can be dangerous for you and your baby.</p><p/><p>Having HELLP syndrome can make it more likely that your baby will:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be born early &ndash; Being born early can cause babies to have lung, eye, brain, and other problems.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be small</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15140023\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for HELLP syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. HELLP syndrome causes many changes in the blood. To check for the condition, your doctor or nurse can do a series of blood tests. You might also have other tests, but that is not always necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15140040\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if you are pregnant and:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have belly pain, especially in the middle or right upper belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have nausea and vomiting, especially along with belly pain</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15140055\"><span class=\"h1\">How is HELLP syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When HELLP syndrome develops during pregnancy, the only cure is giving birth to the baby. Doctors usually treat the condition by giving women medicines to make them go into labor, even if that means the baby will be born early. In some cases, doctors do a c-section (surgery to get the baby out) instead of giving medicines that cause labor. The risks of having HELLP are worse than the risks of having a baby born early.</p><p>Doctors sometimes give women medicines called steroids for 2 days before delivering the baby. These medicines speed up the growth of the baby's lungs so he or she can breathe more easily after birth. (These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.)</p><p>Other treatments might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to control high blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to prevent seizures (preeclampsia can cause seizures)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood transfusion, which is when you get blood that has been donated by another person</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15140070\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you had HELLP syndrome in one pregnancy, you could have it again. You also have a higher chance of getting preeclampsia.</p><p>Before you get pregnant again, see your doctor or nurse for a checkup. Talk with your doctor, nurse, or midwife about HELLP syndrome, preeclampsia, and other health conditions that could affect your next pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15140085\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preeclampsia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-and-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure and pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Preeclampsia (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
