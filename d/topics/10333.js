Peak flow meters are available at low cost (eg, $30 or less). The asthma action plan should include clear instructions about how to reach the clinician during exacerbations. Instructions to a patient regarding self-administration of medications and self-monitoring differ depending upon the patient's history (eg, medications currently used to treat asthma, prior history of severe exacerbations, and prior experience with oral glucocorticoids) and ability to understand and follow directions.

Peak flow measurements take less than one minute to perform and are safe and inexpensive. However, careful instruction is needed to obtain reliable measurements. Peak flow monitoring is particularly useful in patients with poor perception of asthma symptoms.

Each patient should establish a baseline measure with which to compare future readings. A decrement in peak flow of greater than 20 percent from normal, or from the patient's personal best value, signals the presence of an asthma exacerbation. The difference in peak flow from the patient&rsquo;s baseline helps one gauge the severity of the change. A PEF less than 50 percent of baseline should be considered a severe attack. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23099879\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors for fatal asthma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients are at greater risk for life-threatening and potentially fatal asthma attacks.

The subsequent dose of the SABA depends on the severity of the exacerbation.

As an example, among patients with a mild increase in asthma symptoms and a small decrease in peak flow (eg, 15 percent for two days or 30 percent for one day), quadrupling the dose of inhaled glucocorticoids, rather than no change, resulted in a decrease in the likelihood of needing oral glucocorticoids (relative risk [RR] 0.43, 95% CI 0.24-0.78) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Thus, a normal PaCO<sub>2</sub> (eucapnia) during an asthma exacerbation indicates that airway narrowing is so severe that the respiratory system cannot respond adequately to the output of the respiratory center. Hypercapnia and respiratory failure can then develop rapidly with any further airway obstruction or with respiratory muscle fatigue. Progressive hypercapnia during an exacerbation of asthma is generally an indication for mechanical ventilation. Asthmatic exacerbations, with an associated sense of suffocation, are often associated with anxiety and at times with a counterproductive breathing pattern of rapid, shallow breaths. It is tempting to treat this manifestation of the exacerbation with anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines, but such treatment comes with the risk of central respiratory depression and potential precipitation of hypercapnic respiratory failure. A preferable strategy in most cases is effective bronchodilation to relieve the sense of dyspnea and on-going reassurance, with encouragement to take slow-deep breaths (to minimize dead space ventilation and breath-stacking with excessive hyperinflation).</p><p>Measurement of the tension of carbon dioxide in peripheral venous blood (PvCO<sub>2</sub>) is becoming a more common practice in emergency departments. A normal or low venous blood PvCO<sub>2</sub> reliably predicts a normal or low arterial tension of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) and can be used to exclude hypercapnia, although the overall correlation between PvCO<sub>2</sub> and PaCO<sub>2</sub> is poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-acute-exacerbations-of-asthma-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].
