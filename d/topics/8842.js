Although patients with mild to moderate illness may respond to psychotherapy, patients with severe (eg, suicidality or psychosis), chronic, or recurrent syndromes often require pharmacotherapy. </p><p>The decision to prescribe antidepressants for pregnant patients requires clinicians to weigh the negative impact of untreated mood and anxiety disorders against the adverse effects of antidepressants. Although the risks to infants from antenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) appear to be small, the potential risks are uncertain due to the lack of high quality data on the impact of these drugs. The complexity of managing pregnant women with mood and anxiety disorders requires coordinated efforts among psychiatrists, primary care clinicians, obstetricians, and pediatricians. </p><p>Maternal use of SSRIs and SNRIs during pregnancy and breastfeeding is estimated at 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infants-with-antenatal-exposure-to-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris-and-serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Rather, the literature consists of observational studies that have compared pregnant women who chose to use antidepressants with pregnant women who chose not to use antidepressants, and there may be important prognostic differences between these two groups. Most postnatal adverse events possibly related to antenatal SSRI or SNRI exposure occur in less than 1 percent of infants. Thus, a sufficient number of exposures is required to detect an association, and large observational studies are preferable to case reports and series. </p><p>In designing observational studies to examine the adverse effects of antenatal exposure to antidepressants, it is preferable to prospectively measure exposures, covariates, and outcomes. However, neonatal outcomes are often examined with retrospective, population based registry studies that were not designed expressly to examine the effects of antenatal exposure. Registry studies have the advantage of high generalizability and large sample size to detect the small risks associated with SSRI <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> SNRI exposure; limitations include difficulty in determining exactly when exposure occurred during the pregnancy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> whether infants were actually exposed (as opposed to mothers filling prescriptions, but not taking medication). Ascertainment bias can also be a problem, because patients and clinicians may be more likely to report and document adverse events in neonates after a drug exposure, compared to infants with no antenatal drug exposure. </p><p>Another type of observational study is the case control study, in which infants experiencing the outcome under study (cases) are matched to infants not experiencing the outcome (controls), to look for differential odds of in utero exposure to antidepressants. Limitations of these studies can include inflated risk estimates due to the study design itself and recall bias (one is more likely to recall an exposure if one experiences an adverse event). </p><p>General information about study designs is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glossary-of-common-biostatistical-and-epidemiological-terms#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glossary of common biostatistical and epidemiological terms&quot;, section on 'Study designs'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90522767\"><span class=\"h3\">Confounding factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Associations between antidepressant exposures and adverse outcomes that are found in observational studies do not prove that the exposures caused the outcomes. One variable that may explain at least part of the association is the severity of the maternal psychiatric illness, which is difficult to quantify without clinical interviews. Pregnant patients with more severe psychiatric illness are more likely to receive antidepressants. </p><p>Other variables that could explain associations between antenatal use of SSRIs and SNRIs and infant outcomes include the gestational age at exposure; antidepressant dose; comorbid general medical disorders (including obesity); comorbid psychiatric disorders; exposure to tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs; exposure to prescription and nonprescription medications; poor nutrition; inadequate prenatal care; and delivery complications. It is often not possible to account for these factors using the registry data that comprise much of the evidence; eg, comorbidity is difficult to quantify without clinical interviews. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H368227\"><span class=\"h2\">Differences among antidepressants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not clear whether the risk of neonatal complications following antenatal exposure to antidepressants differs between SSRIs and SNRIs; it is also not clear whether differences exist among individual drugs. Adverse effects may differ among drugs because of differences in potency, receptor selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties (such as half-life and the presence of active and non-active metabolites). However, most studies analyze pooled data from mothers treated with a variety of SSRIs and SNRIs. In studies that have performed subgroup analyses with specific drug classes or individual antidepressants, confidence intervals around the effect sizes of different <span class=\"nowrap\">classes/drugs</span> typically overlap, which suggests that any observed adverse effects are likely attributable to all of the drug classes, or all of the drugs within a class. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90522773\"><span class=\"h1\">TERATOGENICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The teratogenicity of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors is discussed separately.
