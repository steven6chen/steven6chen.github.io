We suggest vaccination, given the seriousness of meningococcal disease and the availability of licensed vaccines with reasonable efficacy and safety. Serogroup B meningococcus vaccination may be administered to adolescents and young adults 16 through 23 years of age to provide short-term protection against most strains of serogroup B meningococcal disease; the preferred age for vaccination is 16 through 18 years of age (perhaps at the time of the Menactra or Menveo booster dose) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meningococcal-vaccines/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Serogroup B meningococcal vaccination is also warranted in outbreak settings (defined as two or more primary cases of <em>N. meningitidis</em> serogroup B infection in organizations producing on overall attack rate of &gt;10 cases per 100,000 persons within a six-month period) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/meningococcal-vaccines/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

The goal of vaccination during a meningococcal outbreak is to achieve a level of herd immunity in the target population, which results in reduced spread of infection via the nasopharyngeal route.
