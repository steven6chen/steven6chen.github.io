In patients with signs or symptoms of respiratory distress in the PACU, NIV should be initiated early, rather than waiting until there is evidence of severe respiratory failure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51201\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51201 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-problems-in-the-post-anesthesia-care-unit-pacu/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. In a 2015 meta-analysis of use of NIV treatment for patients with evidence of acute respiratory failure (ARF) after upper abdominal surgery, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) reduced the need for reintubation (risk ratio [RR] 0.25, 95% CI 0.08-0.83) and length of stay in the ICU (approximately two days) compared with standard O<sub>2</sub> and medical therapy (two trials; 269 participants) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-problems-in-the-post-anesthesia-care-unit-pacu/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Other systematic reviews of NIV prophylaxis or treatment of respiratory failure after a variety of surgical procedures came to similar conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-problems-in-the-post-anesthesia-care-unit-pacu/abstract/17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20</a>].

This can occur even if reversal agents were administered (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neostigmine</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycopyrrolate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sugammadex-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sugammadex</a>), although such reversal diminishes the likelihood of residual weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-problems-in-the-post-anesthesia-care-unit-pacu/abstract/10,12,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12,24</a>]. Other factors contributing to pharyngeal muscle relaxation include the effects of opioids, volatile anesthetics, or other agents with sedative properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-problems-in-the-post-anesthesia-care-unit-pacu/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

As the patient attempts to draw in air, negative pressure generated in the thorax brings the pharyngeal tissues even closer together, further obstructing the airway. Absence of airflow into the trachea manifests as retraction at the sternal notch and paradoxical motion of the abdominal musculature. Severe upper airway obstruction results in oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) desaturation, atelectasis, and respiratory failure. This is more likely in patients with obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), or tonsillar or adenoidal hypertrophy because of excess pharyngeal or nasal soft tissue.</p><p>Simple maneuvers may be effective (eg, a chin lift or jaw thrust maneuver to bring both the mandible and the base of the tongue forward, thus opening the inlet to the posterior oropharynx, or lateral decubitus positioning). Oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airways are useful adjuncts. Nasopharyngeal airways are better tolerated than oral airways at light levels of sedation because of lesser risk of provoking a gag reflex, but must be carefully inserted to avoid creating a nosebleed. Such airway support devices are left in place until complete recovery from anesthetic effects is observed.

An inflated endotracheal tube cuff in the subglottic larynx can compress the anterior branch of the recurrent laryngeal nerve between the cricoid and thyroid cartilage, resulting in nerve injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-problems-in-the-post-anesthesia-care-unit-pacu/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Vocal cord paralysis due to these reasons typically recovers spontaneously over a period of days to months.</p><p>In the immediate postoperative period, unilateral paralysis is often asymptomatic. Hoarseness is typically noted immediately after extubation. The resulting increased airway resistance is usually tolerated by healthy patients, but may create difficulty for patients with pre-existing pulmonary comorbidity.
