Classic HIDS is due to compound heterozygous or homozygous mutation in the mevalonate kinase (<em>MVK</em>) gene. The underlying genetic defect is not known in variant HIDS.</p><p>Recurrent fever that is not due to infection is a clinical feature of several disorders that are collectively referred to as autoinflammatory diseases. HIDS is one of the major periodic fever syndromes, which is a subset of autoinflammatory diseases. An overview of periodic and recurrent fevers and other autoinflammatory diseases is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periodic fever syndromes and other autoinflammatory diseases: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations, laboratory features, and diagnosis of HIDS are reviewed here. Pathophysiology and management of HIDS are presented separately.

The median age of onset of symptoms was six months in one series (range one week to 10 years of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Most patients experienced their first attack within the first year of life (78.1 percent).</p><p>HIDS is equally common in males and females. More than 60 percent of patients are of Dutch or French ancestry, although HIDS cases have been reported around the world, including in the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Turkey, the Czech Republic, the United States, Japan, and the Arabian peninsula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-6</a>].

Symptoms vanish as the fever declines. The exception is skin and joint manifestations, which tend to linger, although they still typically resolve before the onset of the next attack. Symptom length can vary greatly by individual.</p><p>The interval between attacks is commonly four to eight weeks but can vary significantly even in the same patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Children and adolescents often have shorter intervals, but no strict periodicity has been identified. Patients are virtually symptom free between attacks. Provocative factors include vaccinations, minor trauma, surgery, and stress, although a trigger is not always apparent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIDS episodes are characterized by the rapid onset of fever, often heralded by chills, and an increase in temperature to over 101.3&deg;F (38.5&deg;C). The febrile episodes typically last four to seven days, and the fever does not remit until the episode concludes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Most patients or caregivers can predict the impending onset of fever by recognizing prodromal symptoms that include nasal congestion, sore throat, backache, fatigue, vertigo, headache, and even behavioral changes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphadenopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over 90 percent of patients have palpable lymphadenopathy during a febrile episode. The cervical region is the most commonly involved site, but almost all lymph node groups may be affected. Nodes are tender <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rubbery on palpation. Lymph node biopsies show various nonspecific changes including hyperplasia and the presence of plasma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aside from fever, abdominal pain may be the cardinal feature of an attack and is seen in approximately 85 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The pain may be accompanied by vomiting (71 percent) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea (72 percent). The level of pain may mimic an acute abdomen and has prompted appendectomies and exploratory laparotomies. Inevitably, the appendix is found to be normal. Abdominal adhesions have been found in a few cases and are sometimes extensive enough to cause a mechanical ileus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Splenomegaly</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palpable splenomegaly is noted in approximately 50 percent of patients, most of whom are children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The prevalence of splenomegaly in adults is uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Arthralgia/arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eighty percent of patients with HIDS may experience polyarthralgia with a febrile episode. Most of those with arthralgia develop objective signs of arthritis. Larger joints are more commonly affected than smaller ones and often in a symmetrical fashion. Joint involvement has not been seen in the absence of an ongoing or preceding febrile episode. Joint symptoms tend to linger beyond the end of the febrile period. Long-term joint destruction does not appear to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Mucocutaneous manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous manifestations occur in over 80 percent of HIDS patients. An erythematous macular rash is the most commonly noted, followed in frequency by papules, urticaria, erythematous nodules, and petechiae. Eruptions typically consist of multiple lesions, which usually remain separate but may become confluent. Acral lesions occur more frequently than truncal lesions. Skin biopsies typically demonstrate endothelial swelling and perivascular inflammatory infiltrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>].</p><p>Aphthous ulcers are reported to occur with a frequency of 48.5 percent, with or without genital ulcers (frequency not reported) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. They can be a very prominent symptom, as evidenced by three patients in a case series of approximately 100 who were initially diagnosed with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome prior to being diagnosed with HIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Other manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to 12 percent of patients may develop serositis during an attack [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Orbital tendonitis with tendomyositis was reported in a single patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Secondary (amyloid A, AA) amyloidosis is a rare but serious long-term complication of HIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-amyloidosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of amyloidosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>). One case of nummular keratopathy successfully controlled with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> was also reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2997905908\"><span class=\"h2\">HIDS during pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a paucity of data on HIDS and pregnancy. Two women with HIDS experienced a decrease in frequency of attacks during their pregnancies, had no complications of pregnancy, and had healthy newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Another woman had no attacks or complications during three pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Variant HIDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Variant HIDS cases differ from classic HIDS in the lack of a known genetic mutation. Such patients can present later in life, even into adulthood, and sometimes manifest less common symptoms such as serositis, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly (seen in 19, 22, and 32 percent, respectively, in one case series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, the intervals between attacks tend to be more variable. These patients also have elevated serum immunoglobulin D (IgD) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) as diagnostic laboratory findings, although levels may be lower than in patients with classic HIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-pathophysiology#H1534912593\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome: Pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Variant HIDS'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1894597\"><span class=\"h2\">Overlap syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although rare, some patients may develop features that overlap with other periodic fever syndromes. As an example, one case report highlights a 10-year-old boy with tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) who also had some features suggestive of HIDS including an elevated IgD level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Another patient had mutations in both the gene associated with HIDS (<em>MVK</em> V377I and L234P mutations) and the gene associated with TRAPS (<em>TNFRSF1A</em> R92Q mutation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This patient developed amyloidosis, which is very rare in HIDS but occurs in approximately 15 percent of patients with TRAPS. In another case report, a patient with a similar mutation combination (<em>MVK</em> V377I and <em>TNFRSF1A</em> R92Q) had mild HIDS-associated clinical features but did not have evidence of TRAPS-associated features including amyloidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-pathophysiology#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome: Pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Overlap syndromes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periodic fever syndromes and other autoinflammatory diseases: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, the R92Q mutation is present in 3 to 5 percent of the Caucasian population, which suggests that it is a benign polymorphism rather than a pathogenic mutation. It is also possible that the R92Q mutation is not causative, per se, but may be a genetic modifier of other inflammatory diseases (ie, modifies the presentation of the <em>MVK</em> mutations rather than causing TRAPS in a patient that also has HIDS).

In one series, 22 percent of patients had a normal maximum IgD level, even when measured serially over time including during and between attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Initially thought to be etiologically linked to the pathophysiology, some now consider elevated IgD levels to be an epiphenomenon secondary to the systemic inflammatory process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>An elevated IgD is only suggestive of HIDS in the setting of clinical features consistent with the disorder.

In contrast, urinary mevalonic acid levels are chronically elevated, and usually to higher levels, in patients with mevalonic aciduria. Mevalonic acid excretion is assessed by determining the ratio of mevalonic acid to creatinine in an untimed sample of urine. An elevated ratio (&gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/mol</span> creatinine) is suggestive of HIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, techniques and sensitivities for measuring urinary mevalonic acid levels vary widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Thus, we do not recommend the use of the urinary mevalonic acid to urine creatinine ratio as a confirmatory test for HIDS.

Urinary LTE4 levels were undetectable in 20 other children without HIDS who had bacterial or viral illnesses.

If the diagnosis is suspected on clinical grounds, serum immunoglobulin D (IgD) should be measured (immunoglobulin A [IgA] is also typically measured but is not required for diagnosis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108260\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef108260 \">algorithm 1</a>). The finding of elevated serum IgD with or without an elevated IgA level is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Normal values for IgD and IgA differ by age in children and should be taken into consideration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F62882%7ERHEUM%2F53169\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62882 graphicRef53169 \">table 2A-B</a>). Suspected cases of classic, but not variant, HIDS with normal serum IgD and IgA levels can be diagnosed by genetic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Genetic testing is otherwise not required to confirm the diagnosis. However, it is useful for establishing a family pedigree, and it is the most definitive diagnostic test if a mutation is identified. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> below.)</p><p>The median period from disease onset to diagnosis is approximately 14 years in patients who lack a family history of HIDS, and approximately one-third of patients are initially misdiagnosed with another disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This delay in diagnosis is due to the fact that symptoms manifested by patients with HIDS are typical of more common illnesses that are usually excluded before rarer diagnoses are considered. The periodic pattern of symptom recurrence is often the clue that finally leads to the correct diagnosis. Given the rarity of serious, long-term complications, the rationale for confirming the diagnosis of HIDS is to minimize the morbidity associated with extensive workups and unnecessary surgeries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At least 63 mutations in the mevalonate kinase (<em>MVK</em>) gene have been noted in association with HIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/31,32,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32,36,37</a>]. The finding of a compound heterozygous or homozygous previously reported <em>MVK</em> mutation in a patient with clinical suspicion of HIDS establishes the diagnosis.

In the absence of this mutation, genetic sequencing of the <em>MVK</em> gene may be requested if the clinical suspicion of HIDS is high but IgD and IgA levels are normal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F106962\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106962 \">table 3</a>). A negative genetic analysis should not dissuade the clinician from the diagnosis in the face of other positive clinical and laboratory findings consistent with HIDS, since there are most likely other mutations unidentified as of yet. Nearly one-quarter of patients with compatible clinical symptoms, physical findings, and immunoglobulin levels do not have <em>MVK</em> mutations and are categorized as having variant HIDS. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Variant HIDS'</a> above.)</p><p>Genetic testing for HIDS is unlikely to be positive in patients whose febrile attacks began at &ge;5 years of age, last more than 14 days, and do not have associated joint pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Other diseases should be suspected in the setting of an elevated immunoglobulin D (IgD) without other clinical features suggestive of HIDS. Even when there is a family history of HIDS, alternative diagnoses, particularly infectious diseases and surgical emergencies, must be considered and excluded when a child or adult presents with fever and abdominal pain.

However, the phenotype of MEVA is more severe and often lethal in infancy. In addition to experiencing febrile episodes and HIDS-like features of recurrent fever, lymphadenopathy, and skin rash, infants with MEVA can also present with developmental delay, ataxia, failure to thrive, dysmorphic features, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, myopathy, and cataracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Very little or no MVK enzyme activity is present in affected children (&lt;0.5 percent activity compared with normal controls), and large amounts of mevalonic acid are excreted in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].

Structural analysis suggests that these mutations interfere with the active sites of the MVK enzyme, thereby significantly reducing or inhibiting its activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Some experts feel that MEVA and HIDS are simply two points on a spectrum of disease, termed mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hyperimmunoglobulin-d-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/41,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,44,45</a>].
