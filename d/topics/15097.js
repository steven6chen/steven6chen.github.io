There is a female predominance in RA, and many female patients are of childbearing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, the management of RA during conception and pregnancy is a common challenge for rheumatologists. In many patients with RA, disease activity improves substantially in the gravid state. However, modification of treatment so as to minimize the potential for fetal toxicity while maintaining adequate disease control can be difficult in patients whose RA flares or remains active.</p><p>The influence of RA upon fertility and pregnancy, the influence of pregnancy upon the disease, and the management of RA during conception, pregnancy and lactation will be reviewed here. The use of antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs in patients with rheumatic diseases during pregnancy and lactation is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=safety-of-antiinflammatory-and-immunosuppressive-drugs-in-rheumatic-diseases-during-pregnancy-and-lactation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Safety of antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs in rheumatic diseases during pregnancy and lactation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1533602192\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECT OF RA ON FERTILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smaller family size has been observed in women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The reasons for this appear multifactorial, including patient choice, medication use during the usual period of family planning, and subfertility related to disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The relative importance of each potential factor has been difficult to determine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one structured telephone survey of 411 women with RA, 8 percent reported having been advised by medical professionals to limit family size, and 20 percent reported that having RA affected their decision to have children; concerns for carrying the child, caring for the child, and passing on RA to biologic offspring were cited as contributing reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In this same group, receiving the diagnosis of RA prior to the birth of the first child or receiving the diagnosis prior to age 18 were associated with fewer pregnancies and children; by contrast, women who were diagnosed with RA after age 30 did not report smaller family sizes compared with the reference population. Similarly, in a registry-based study from Norway, women with RA who did not have children prior to diagnosis were less likely to become pregnant than controls at the end of the observation period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another survey involving 578 women with RA, patients were asked about the number of pregnancies, live births, miscarriages, and pregnancy terminations they had had [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Over half (55 percent) of the patients had fewer pregnancies than intended; of these women, 42 percent cited infertility as a reason and the remainder limited the number of pregnancies because of arthritis-related concerns, which included the ability to care for children, the concern that the disease activity would be impacted, and concerns about passing on the susceptibility to RA to their offspring.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of normal ovarian reserve in patients with RA was found in a study of 72 women with early RA who were shown to have comparable age-adjusted serum anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone levels with 509 healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. By contrast, findings in a subsequent study, involving 33 patients with RA, suggested that anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone levels were lower in women with RA even when adjusting for age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with RA attempting to conceive have been found to have a longer time to pregnancy compared with women without RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; findings from a nationwide prospective cohort study in the Netherlands involving 245 women with RA attempting pregnancy or in their first trimester found that the time to pregnancy exceeded 12 months in 42 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Factors associated with a longer time to pregnancy after adjustment for multiple variables included increased age, nulliparity, disease activity (disease activity score in 28 joints, DAS28), and preconception use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (hazard ratios [HR] for pregnancy of 0.96, 95% CI 0.92-1.00, per year of age; 0.52, 95% CI 0.38-0.70, for nulliparity; 0.81, 95% CI 0.71-0.93 per point increase in DAS28; 0.66, 95% CI 0.46-0.94, for use of NSAIDs; and 0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.83, for use of prednisone). Use of higher prednisone doses (greater than 7.5 mg daily) was associated with elevated risk (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.33-0.76), while lower doses were not.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Factors that were not associated with a prolonged time to pregnancy included disease duration, smoking, being seropositive for rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA), use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ), and past use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunology of pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many immunologic changes must occur during pregnancy to maintain the viability of the fetus, whose cells express antigenic determinants derived from the father that are foreign to the maternal immune system. Immunologists conceptualize pregnancy as comprising three distinct phases: implantation, an inflammatory state; fetal growth, a relative antiinflammatory T-helper-2 predominant phase; and finally parturition, where there is an increase locally in inflammatory cells and cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>For example, peripheral T lymphocytes such as T-reg cells increase during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Peripheral natural killer (NK) cells decrease during pregnancy and produce lower levels of interferon gamma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Historically, the immunologic model of pregnancy was that pregnancy induced a shift from a T-helper-1 (cellular immune), to a T-helper-2 (humoral immune) predominant state and thought that that shift may impact diseases such as RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/10,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15</a>]; however, this model may be overly simplistic, and it is likely that the changes to the immune system are more complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/10,11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2423974949\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS OF PREGNANCY ON DISEASE ACTIVITY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease activity during pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 50 to 70 percent of women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) improve during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. The decrease in disease activity generally starts in the first trimester and lasts through the duration of pregnancy. Most patients will flare in the postpartum period. Disease characteristics, such as duration of disease and functional class, do not appear to predict whether a patient will remit during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. However, some data suggest that patients who lack both rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) are more likely to improve during pregnancy than patients with either or both autoantibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Other factors that may impact disease activity during pregnancy include the degree of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II disparity between mother and fetus. Several studies have shown that increased HLA class II disparity between mother and fetus is more likely to lead to improvement in disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>Not all studies have found improvement in symptoms with pregnancy. As an example, one report that evaluated the clinical course of 140 pregnant women with RA noted only minimal improvement in Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) scores and in joint symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, the results of the study should be interpreted with caution as the HAQ as an estimate of functionality is likely impacted by pregnancy itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Postpartum flare</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 90 percent of patients flare during the postpartum period, usually within the first three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, one study suggested an increased risk of developing RA in the first three months postpartum, particularly after a woman&rsquo;s first pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1430082292\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF RA DURING PREGNANCY AND LACTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication use during pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who require continued treatment or who experience a disease flare during pregnancy, therapeutic choices are governed not only by disease severity but also by concerns regarding fetal toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>].

However, women with RA (or other inflammatory arthritis) who experience a higher level of disease activity during the third trimester <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who take glucocorticoids are at risk for small for gestational age babies and for preterm delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].

Pregnancy outcome in RA was examined in a Danish study of<strong> </strong>1,917,723 children, including 13,556 children exposed to maternal RA or maternal preclinical RA, and adjusted for maternal age at birth, parity (1, 2, or 3), maternal education at the time of birth, smoker or non-smoker status, and mother&rsquo;s country of origin (Denmark or outside Denmark), but not adjusted for drug therapy; children born to mothers with RA in Denmark between 1977 and 2008 were significantly more likely to be born preterm (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.20-1.84), as were children of mothers in whom the diagnosis of RA was made following but not before the birth (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.07-1.64). However, medication use and disease activity during pregnancy were not recorded, and the average maternal age was slightly higher in the RA group (30.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">+/-</span> 4.9 verses 28.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">+/-</span> 4.9). These are all factors that can contribute to preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatoid-arthritis-and-pregnancy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The birth weight of children of mothers with RA or preclinical RA was also slightly reduced (87 grams) compared with children of mothers without RA.

However, approximately 90 percent of patients flare during the postpartum period, usually within the first three months. There may be an increased risk of developing RA in the first three months postpartum, particularly after a woman&rsquo;s first pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Disease activity during pregnancy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Postpartum flare'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RA has not been convincingly shown to be associated with an increase in fetal morbidity or fetal losses, and pregnancy outcomes in women with well-controlled RA are comparable to those in the general population. Women with RA who experience a higher level of disease activity during the third trimester <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who take glucocorticoids are at risk for giving birth to babies who are small for gestational age and for preterm delivery. (See <a href=\"#H647407008\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For RA patients who require continued treatment or who experience a disease flare during pregnancy, therapeutic choices are governed not only by disease severity but also by concerns regarding fetal toxicity (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Medication use during pregnancy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medications with a high or unknown risk of causing birth defects, which should be avoided during conception and pregnancy, include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a> (LEF).

TNF inhibitors should be discontinued by the third trimester of pregnancy, given the theoretical risk of immunosuppression in the newborn. Pegylated TNF-alpha inhibitors may be continued during the entire pregnancy but carry an increased risk of infections. Infants exposed to TNF-alpha inhibitors in utero should not receive live vaccines for the first six months of life.

In patients in whom NSAIDs are inadequate, we use the lowest dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> necessary for disease control. We try to limit prednisone dosing to no more than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. HCQ and SSZ can be used in patients with an inadequate response to NSAIDs or prednisone. TNF-alpha inhibitors can be continued during pregnancy or initiated if patients flare.
