In most instances, the patient is asymptomatic. The majority of intranasal FBs are removed at initial presentation and do not require referral to an otolaryngologist. Button batteries and paired disc magnets can cause serious damage to nasal structures and merit urgent removal. </p><p>The diagnosis and management of intranasal FBs is presented here.

Intranasal FBs typically present in toddlers and preschoolers and less often in older children, adolescents, and adults with intellectual or behavioral disabilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

A wide variety of foreign bodies find their way into the nose including inorganic items, such as pearls and beads, pins, nails, screws, paper, stones, rubber, small toys, crayons, and chalk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>] and food items, such as beans, carrots, seeds, meat, apples, candy, and chewing gum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/1,4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,6,7</a>]. </p><p>Two types of FBs deserve special mention because of their potential for damage to nasal structures:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Button batteries </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Button batteries are found in many devices including toys, hearing aids, and household electronics. Once in the nose, they cause destruction because of strong electrical currents (rather than leakage of battery contents). Electrolysis at the negative battery pole generates hydroxide ions that cause alkaline tissue necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. If the negative pole is directed toward the nasal septum, this can result in septal perforation in under four hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86432\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86432 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Paired disc magnets</strong> &ndash; Strong, 1 cm diameter, round disc magnets are used to attach some types of jewelry (eg, metal earrings and nose rings) and are popular in adolescents and young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

These objects produce local inflammatory reactions or become secondarily infected also leading to sneezing, epistaxis, nasal obstruction, foul-smelling nasal discharge, and facial pain from sinusitis. </p><p>Button battery FBs may also produce a purulent nasal discharge and epistaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In patients with associated tissue necrosis, the discharge may have a black color [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Facial swelling with pain and fever may also occur and be mistaken for periorbital cellulitis or sinusitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. </p><p>The clinician should carefully examine both nostrils and ears in patients with a nasal FB to ensure that no other objects are present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13572187\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Visualization of the foreign body (FB) establishes the diagnosis. In most children, this can be accomplished with the use of a headlight or otoscope after suctioning of purulent secretions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86438\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86438 \">picture 4</a>); however, some FBs that are located high in the nasal vault or posterior nasal cavity may elude detection with an otoscope or headlight. Thin or transparent FBs are also sometimes hard to find. In these patients, rigid or flexible fiberoptic endoscopy may be necessary to identify the FB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Most nasal FBs are radiolucent. Thus, plain radiographs are <strong>not</strong> routinely needed or helpful when the FB is clearly visualized on physical examination and the presence of a button battery or magnet is excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>However, plain radiographs can establish the presence of button batteries or magnets within the nasal cavity when suspected. These studies are suggested when the type of FB is not obvious on physical examination or is associated with significant epistaxis, black nasal discharge, pain, or facial swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/10,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,23</a>]. Unsuspected FBs (either radio-opaque or encrusted in calcium salts) may also present as incidental findings on sinus radiographs or computed tomography performed for symptoms of clinical sinusitis or periorbital cellulitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86434\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86434 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/19,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4708244\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most patients, visualization of a nasal foreign body (FB) during physical examination or the presence of foul-smelling unilateral discharge makes the distinction of nasal FB from other entities associated with <strong>bilateral</strong> nasal discharge, such as sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, or allergic rhinitis straight forward. Occasionally, a child with bilateral nasal discharge may have placed FBs in both nasal cavities without the caregiver&rsquo;s knowledge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, all patients with nasal discharge warrant careful examination of the nasal cavity to exclude a foreign body before other treatments (eg, antibiotics for sinusitis or allergy medications for allergic rhinitis) are prescribed.

Otherwise, nasal foreign body (FB) extraction is an elective procedure. Concern for migration of an inert nasal FB through the nasopharynx followed by aspiration into the trachea is not warranted in a normal healthy patient with intact airway reflexes. The estimated risk for this complication is less than 6 in 10,000 cases. In addition, there are no reports of bronchial FBs spontaneously arising from nasal FBs in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>However, aspiration of a nasal FB has occurred during attempts at removal and the risk is likely increased when extraction is attempted by inexperienced clinicians or under circumstances in which appropriate instruments or personnel to ensure adequate restraint are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H373855860\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for subspecialty consultation or referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients with nasal FBs, referral to an otolaryngologist is not necessary. As an example, in one case series of 60 children, 98 percent of nasal FBs were successfully removed by pediatric emergency clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Thus, medical specialty is less important than experience, availability of proper equipment and restraint, and knowledge of which FBs are likely to require special skills for extraction. </p><p>Otolaryngology referral is warranted for the following FBs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior FBs (ie, not readily visualized by anterior rhinoscopy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic or impacted FBs associated with marked inflammation, especially button batteries which warrant urgent removal </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Penetrating or hooked FBs </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any FB that cannot be removed at initial attempt due to poor cooperation, bleeding, or limited instrumentation </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H373855867\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most nasal FBs can be removed using positive pressure techniques or direct instrumentation in the primary care office or emergency department. The procedure that is used is determined by the nature and location of the FB. Although success has been reported with nasal irrigation of the nasal passage <strong>not</strong> containing the foreign body, we do <strong>not</strong> advocate this technique given the theoretical potential for aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13572783\"><span class=\"h3\">Positive pressure techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon small case series and expert opinion, we suggest that patients with soft or smooth nasal FBs that totally occlude the anterior nasal cavity undergo removal using positive pressure techniques rather than instrumentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/28,32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,32-35</a>]. Having the patient blow his or her nose while occluding the nostril opposite of the FB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86445\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86445 \">picture 5</a>) is the easiest method and is frequently successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, this technique is only applicable to cooperative patients who are generally older than three years of age. </p><p>Oral positive pressure by the parent while occluding the unaffected nostril has been described in case reports and small case series of children with nasal FBs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-36</a>]. In a systematic review of 152 children undergoing the technique, successful foreign body removal occurred in 60 percent with no reported complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>Visibility and time since insertion may be important factors in determining successful removal. As an example, mouth-to-mouth blowing by the parent (&ldquo;parent&rsquo;s kiss&rdquo;) successfully removed 15 of 19 nasal FBs with no complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In this study, which was not included in the systematic review mentioned above, all FBs were visible with anterior rhinoscopy, and the median time since insertion was four hours (range one hour to two weeks). The children were allowed to sit or stand, depending upon their preference. The unaffected side of the nose was occluded and the parents were instructed to firmly seal their mouth over the child's mouth and give a short, sharp puff of air into the child's mouth. </p><p>Children typically tolerate this procedure well without restraint. If the parent is unwilling or unable to perform this procedure, then the approach can be approximated using a bag-valve-mask, although patient cooperation is unlikely and restraint will probably be necessary. </p><p>If removal by positive pressure techniques is unsuccessful, the clinician may proceed to instrumentation as described below. (See <a href=\"#H13572790\" class=\"local\">'Instrumentation'</a> below.)</p><p>Nasal positive pressure is another method that has been described in small case series with evidence of barotrauma reported in one patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-intranasal-foreign-bodies/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. However, in our opinion, the potential for excess application of pressure to the nasopharynx is high, and we do not advocate this approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13572790\"><span class=\"h3\">Instrumentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon case series and expert opinion, we suggest that patients with nonocclusive foreign bodies in the anterior portion of the nose undergo removal by instrumentation rather than positive pressure techniques. Instrumentation permits intranasal FB removal under direct visualization and examination of the nasal cavity after extraction. Adequate restraint, appropriate illumination, and proper equipment are essential to success.

(See <a href=\"#H373855773\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13572452\" class=\"local\">'Clinical anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most FBs are inorganic (eg, pearls, beads, or small toys) and relatively asymptomatic. Unilateral purulent and foul-smelling nasal discharge in a young child strongly suggests the presence of a porous nasal FB such as paper or foam rubber or organic matter (eg, carrot, meat, or other food material) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86433\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86433 \">picture 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4708018\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intranasal button batteries are associated with purulent nasal discharge that is sometimes black in color, epistaxis, and facial pain with swelling and have significant potential for damage to nasal structures. (See <a href=\"#H4708018\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visualization of the FB establishes the diagnosis. The clinician should carefully examine both nostrils and ears in patients with a nasal FB to ensure that no other objects are present. Plain radiographs can establish the presence of button batteries or magnets within the nasal cavity when suspected but are not necessary for the diagnosis of other types of intranasal FBs. (See <a href=\"#H13572187\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Button batteries in the nasal cavity and magnets that are attached across the nasal septum warrant urgent removal. Otherwise, nasal FB extraction is an elective procedure. (See <a href=\"#H373855853\" class=\"local\">'Timing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with intranasal FBs, referral to an otolaryngologist is not necessary. Potential indications for referral to a specialist include posterior, impacted, or penetrating FBs and those that cannot be removed at the initial attempt due to poor cooperation, bleeding, or limited instrumentation. When safe removal of a nasal FB is doubtful based upon the setting or patient factors, removal in the operating room under general anesthesia with airway protection is advised. (See <a href=\"#H373855860\" class=\"local\">'Indications for subspecialty consultation or referral'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13572790\" class=\"local\">'Instrumentation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients with soft or smooth nasal FBs that totally occlude the anterior nasal cavity undergo removal using positive pressure techniques rather than instrumentation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

The choice of instrument depends upon the type of foreign body as discussed in the topic.
