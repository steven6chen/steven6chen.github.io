These injuries typically involve the foreskin or redundant penile skin and may occur during the zipping or unzipping process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-zipper-injuries/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Localized edema, superficial tissue abrasions, bruising, and pain are the most common complications of zipper injuries; skin loss or necrosis, is unusual.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Zipper entrapment injuries occur infrequently. In one case series from a pediatric emergency department (ED), one zipper entrapment injury occurred per 4000 new ED attendees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-zipper-injuries/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In this series of 30 boys between the ages of 2 and 12 years of age, 60 percent of the affected boys were wearing underwear at the time of the injury. Most of the injuries were self-inflicted (84 percent) and occurred as the zipper was being zipped up as opposed to down (92 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2311554\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most instances, the uncircumcised foreskin is entrapped in the zipper (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76391\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76391 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-zipper-injuries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Occasionally, redundant tissue on the ventral side of the circumcised penis is involved. </p><p>A zipper is composed of interlocking dentitions that are aligned by a fastener consisting of an inner faceplate, outer faceplate and median bar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58314\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58314 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-zipper-injuries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The fastener and cloth hold the zipped dentitions together. If either the cloth or fastener is disrupted, the zipped dentitions fall apart.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2311562\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should attempt removal of entrapped penile tissue as soon as possible after the zipper injury. With time, swelling and edema of the entrapped tissue makes successful management more difficult. Penile entrapment that involves the urethra or false attempts using the procedures described below, warrants prompt referral to or consultation with a urologist. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2311570\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The child and caregiver should receive an explanation of the procedure. Reassurance and a gentle approach to the injury help to gain patient cooperation and facilitate successful management. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2311440\"><span class=\"h2\">Sedation and pain control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attention to analgesia and anesthesia is essential in the management of boys with zipper injuries. Involvement of a trained child life specialist is advised to provide nonpharmacologic interventions to decrease the pain and anxiety caused by the procedure. Sedation, with appropriate monitoring and personnel, may be warranted in uncooperative patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in children outside of the operating room&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room#H1684879\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in children outside of the operating room&quot;, section on 'Nonpharmacologic interventions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9810261\"><span class=\"h3\">Local anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical anesthesia with liposomal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> (eg, LMX) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-and-prilocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine-prilocaine</a> cream (eg, EMLA) has been shown to provide effective anesthesia for pediatric urologic procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-zipper-injuries/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. They may also be effective for alleviation of zipper entrapment although such use has not been studied. Liposomal lidocaine is preferable because it does not require occlusion and is effective after only 30 minutes of application. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-anesthetics-in-children#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical anesthetics in children&quot;, section on 'Liposomal lidocaine'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-anesthetics-in-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical anesthetics in children&quot;, section on 'EMLA'</a>.) </p><p>Local infiltration with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> can be used before attempting zipper removal or disengagement of the entrapped penile skin if immediate management is necessary.

[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-zipper-injuries/abstract/2,3,7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,7-12</a>] The technique for managing zipper injuries depends upon the site of entrapment within the zipper. The following techniques work for plastic and metal zippers:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Entrapment of penile skin between the zipper teeth without fastener involvement </strong>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58314\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58314 \">picture 1</a>) &ndash; Cut the cloth of the zipper using scissors, which will result in separation of the zipper teeth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61349\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61349 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-zipper-injuries/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Local anesthesia or sedation is not typically necessary for this procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Entrapment of penile skin in the zipper fastener</strong> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58314\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58314 \">picture 1</a>) &ndash; The tissue is more difficult to release in patients in whom the penile tissue is entrapped within the zipper fastener. Sedation may be necessary to complete procedures to perform these techniques in anxious or younger children or in patients with a large amount of tissue entrapment; local anesthesia usually is adequate for older children. (See <a href=\"#H2311440\" class=\"local\">'Sedation and pain control'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The following methods have been described. The clinician should attempt the least painful and traumatic technique first:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Apply <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mineral oil</a> to the affected tissue for 10 to 15 minutes followed by gentle traction to free the penile tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-zipper-injuries/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The mineral oil technique is simple, nonthreatening, and typically avoids the need for sedation and additional tissue trauma. Anecdotal experience suggests that mild liquid soap (eg, dish washing liquid) may provide sufficient lubrication if mineral oil is not available. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cut the median bar of the fastener (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58314\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58314 \">picture 1</a>) using wire cutters, bone cutters, or a mini hacksaw (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63117\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63117 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66997\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66997 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-zipper-injuries/abstract/2,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9-11</a>]. This allows the mechanism to fall apart and leads to release of the entrapped tissue. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Place the thin blade of a flathead screwdriver between the faceplates on the side of the fastener in which the penile tissue is <strong>not</strong> entrapped (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80520\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80520 \">picture 3</a>). The blade is then rotated toward the median bar to widen the gap between the faceplates and release the tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-zipper-injuries/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>After achieving local anesthesia, unzip the zipper back over the entrapped skin or apply lateral traction to the zipper teeth to pull the zipped portion of the zipper apart. Both of these techniques may increase the trauma by repeating the injury to the affected area. </p><p/><p>If the penile tissue remains trapped despite use of these techniques, then prompt consultation with a urologist is warranted for consideration of local excision of entrapped tissue or circumcision. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9810276\"><span class=\"h1\">AFTERCARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The penile tissue is frequently swollen and bruised after a zipper injury. Superficial abrasions may also occur. The urethra should be carefully inspected for potential injury. </p><p>The caregiver should be informed that pain with urination may occur for one to two days after a zipper injury. Dysuria can be moderated by applying triple antibiotic ointment to any skin wounds and by allowing the patient to void while sitting in a tub of warm water.</p><p>The caregiver should be advised to seek medical attention if the patient is unable to void or has hematuria. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9810293\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With most zipper injuries, the uncircumcised foreskin is entrapped in the zipper.
