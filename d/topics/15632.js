Hyperthermia is not synonymous with the more common sign of fever, which is induced by cytokine activation during inflammation and regulated at the level of the hypothalamus. A temperature above 40&ordm;C (or 104&ordm;F) is generally considered to be consistent with severe hyperthermia.</p><p>The evaluation of severe hyperthermia in adults and the management of nonexertional heat stroke will be reviewed here.

The body's heat load results from both metabolic processes and absorption of heat from the environment. As core temperature rises, the preoptic nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus stimulates efferent fibers of the autonomic nervous system to produce sweating and cutaneous vasodilation. </p><p>Evaporation is the principal mechanism of heat loss in a hot environment, but this becomes ineffective above a relative humidity of 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-nonexertional-hyperthermia-classic-heat-stroke-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The other major methods of heat dissipation&mdash;radiation (emission of infrared electromagnetic energy), conduction (direct transfer of heat to an adjacent, cooler object), and convection (direct transfer of heat to convective air currents)&mdash;cannot efficiently transfer heat when environmental temperature exceeds skin temperature.

Above 42&ordm;C (108&ordm;F), oxidative phosphorylation becomes uncoupled, and a variety of enzymes cease to function. A cytokine-mediated systemic inflammatory response develops, and production of heat-shock proteins is increased. Blood is shunted from the splanchnic circulation to the skin and muscles, resulting in gastrointestinal ischemia and increased permeability of the intestinal mucosa. Hepatocytes, vascular endothelium, and neural tissue are most sensitive to increased core temperatures, but all organs may ultimately be involved. In severe cases, patients develop multi-organ system failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-nonexertional-hyperthermia-classic-heat-stroke-in-adults/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>].</p><p>A number of the physiologic mechanisms for coping with an increased environmental heat load are impaired in elder patients.

However, the clinical picture can be unclear. As examples, an elderly woman found unconscious in a sealed house in the middle of summer who has a core temperature of 41.2&ordm;C (106.2&ordm;F) presents many more diagnostic possibilities than a college football player who collapses during summer practice and has the same temperature. The woman may be suffering from sepsis, cerebral hemorrhage, anticholinergic toxicity, withdrawal from a central nervous system depressant, or a host of other conditions. Conversely, her elevated temperature may be due solely to heat exposure. </p><p>No single diagnostic test definitively confirms or excludes heat stroke. Furthermore, laboratory study abnormalities may overlap in patients with heat stroke and with hyperthermia due to other conditions. As an example, patients with heat stroke frequently meet criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-nonexertional-hyperthermia-classic-heat-stroke-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. It may be impossible early in the patient&rsquo;s course to distinguish the two conditions. In such cases when the etiology of hyperthermia is unclear but heat stroke remains a possibility, it is prudent to initiate cooling measures while diagnoses other than heat stroke are pursued. </p><p>Rapid improvement with active cooling suggests that heat stroke is the primary diagnosis. However, improvement may not occur or may occur gradually, particularly in older debilitated patients, depending upon the degree and duration of hyperthermia and other factors. As an example, patients with compromised cardiovascular function due to underlying disease (eg, heart failure) or medications (eg, beta or calcium channel blocker) have limited capacity to respond to increased environmental heat and humidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-nonexertional-hyperthermia-classic-heat-stroke-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In patients whose mental status remains depressed despite effective cooling measures, clinicians should investigate alternative causes for hyperthermia, including conditions affecting the central nervous system (eg, meningitis, cerebral hemorrhage, hypothalamic stroke). Brain imaging and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid may be necessary. </p><p>The most important causes of severe hyperthermia (greater than 40&ordm;C [104&ordm;F]) due to a failure of thermoregulation are heat stroke, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and malignant hyperthermia. The context in which symptoms develop usually suggests the etiology (eg, exertional heat stroke following exercise in high ambient temperature and humidity; malignant hyperthermia after anesthetic agents; neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) among patients treated with antipsychotic medications). Each of these conditions may be associated with severe systemic complications and death. The types of heat stroke are defined below. (See <a href=\"#H2141946\" class=\"local\">'Definitions and clinical findings'</a> above.)</p><p>Malignant hyperthermia is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that manifests following treatment with anesthetic agents, most commonly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=succinylcholine-suxamethonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">succinylcholine</a> and halothane. The onset of malignant hyperthermia is usually within one hour of the administration of general anesthesia, but rarely may be delayed up to 10 hours after induction. Early clinical findings include muscle rigidity (especially masseter stiffness), sinus tachycardia, hypercarbia, and skin cyanosis with mottling. Marked hyperthermia (up to 45&ordm;C [113&ordm;F]) occurs minutes to hours later. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignant-hyperthermia-clinical-diagnosis-and-management-of-acute-crisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignant hyperthermia: Clinical diagnosis and management of acute crisis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is an idiosyncratic reaction most frequently associated with first- and second-generation antipsychotic agents. In addition to hyperthermia, NMS is also characterized by &quot;lead pipe&quot; muscle rigidity, altered mental status, choreoathetosis, tremors, and evidence of autonomic dysfunction, such as diaphoresis, labile blood pressure, and dysrhythmias.

A target CVP of 8 to 12 mmHg is an appropriate target. However, CVP readings may be inaccurate if heat-related cardiac dysfunction develops (eg, acute right heart failure). Alpha-adrenergic agonists should be avoided, since the resultant vasoconstriction decreases heat dissipation. Instead, hypotension or volume depletion is treated with discrete intravenous (IV) boluses of isotonic crystalloid (eg, isotonic saline in boluses of 250 to 500 mL). </p><p>Continuous core temperature monitoring with a rectal or esophageal probe is mandatory, and cooling measures should be stopped once a temperature of 38 to 39&ordm;C (100.4 to 102.2&ordm;F) has been achieved in order to reduce the risk of iatrogenic hypothermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-nonexertional-hyperthermia-classic-heat-stroke-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Cooling measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaporative and convective cooling is the method used most often to treat classic heat stroke because it is effective, noninvasive, easily performed, and does not interfere with other aspects of patient care. When used to treat elderly patients with classic heat stroke, evaporative and convective cooling is associated with decreased morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-nonexertional-hyperthermia-classic-heat-stroke-in-adults/abstract/4,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,37,38</a>]. </p><p>With evaporative and convective cooling, the naked patient is sprayed with a mist of lukewarm water while fans are used to blow air over the moist skin. Special beds called body cooling units have been made for this purpose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-nonexertional-hyperthermia-classic-heat-stroke-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Agitation from an altered mental status or shivering induced by evaporative and convective cooling or other treatments may generate heat and can be suppressed with short-acting IV benzodiazepines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> (1 to 2 mg IV). Benzodiazepines may also improve core body cooling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-nonexertional-hyperthermia-classic-heat-stroke-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

However, chlorpromazine has anticholinergic properties and thus, may impair sweating and exacerbate hypotension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroleptic malignant syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other effective cooling methods are less commonly used in patients with classic heat stroke. Immersing the patient in ice water (cold water immersion) is an efficient, noninvasive method of rapid cooling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-nonexertional-hyperthermia-classic-heat-stroke-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], but it complicates monitoring and intravenous access, and may be harmful to elder patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-nonexertional-hyperthermia-classic-heat-stroke-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. An alternative method that allows greater access to the patient is water ice therapy (WIT), in which the patient is placed supine on a porous stretcher positioned on top of a tub of ice water. Medical personnel continuously pour ice water from the bath onto the patient and massage major muscle groups with ice packs to increase skin vasodilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-nonexertional-hyperthermia-classic-heat-stroke-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Applying ice packs to the axillae, neck, and groin (areas adjacent to major blood vessels) is another effective cooling technique, but may be poorly tolerated by the awake patient. A small randomized trial, in healthy subjects with exercise-induced hyperthermia, reported that applying cold compresses to the glabrous (smooth, hairless) skin surfaces of the cheeks, palms, and soles led to more rapid cooling than applying them to the axillae, neck, and groin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-nonexertional-hyperthermia-classic-heat-stroke-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. This approach warrants further study in classic heat stroke patients with comorbidities that might impair peripheral vasodilatation. </p><p>Cold thoracic and peritoneal lavage results in rapid cooling. However, it is invasive and peritoneal lavage is contraindicated in pregnant patients and those with previous abdominal surgery. Cooled oxygen, cooling blankets, and cold (ie, room temperature, or approximately 22&deg;C [71.6&deg;F]) intravenous fluids may be helpful adjuncts. Cold gastric lavage may cause water intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-nonexertional-hyperthermia-classic-heat-stroke-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Recommendations for the treatment of heat stroke are based primarily upon small observational studies.

Tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are often necessary to protect the airway and to address increased metabolic demands (ie, provide supplemental oxygen and increased minute ventilation). In a review of 28 patients admitted with heat stroke, 24 (86 percent) developed respiratory failure with most requiring mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/severe-nonexertional-hyperthermia-classic-heat-stroke-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

The most important causes of severe hyperthermia (greater than 40&ordm;C [or 104&ordm;F]) caused by a failure of thermoregulation are heat stroke, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and malignant hyperthermia.

Patients with classic heat stroke generally have increased susceptibility to the heat due to age or underlying medical conditions. Diagnostic studies are generally nonspecific but may reflect cardiovascular, renal, or hepatic dysfunction, or coagulopathy. Studies to be obtained are described in the text.
