In contrast, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is rarely measured in peripheral plasma or serum because the concentrations are much lower than and do not correlate well with those in the hypothalamic-hypophysial portal plasma. This is because of contribution from nonhypothalamic sources (eg, the gastrointestinal tract). The measurement of ACTH, CRH, and other related hypothalamic and pituitary peptides will be reviewed here. The approaches to the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome and adrenal insufficiency are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-the-diagnosis-of-cushings-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ACTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The current commercially available two-site immunometric assays have an analytical sensitivity between 0.6 and 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (0.12 to 19.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, performance differs between assays and should be considered when interpreting patient results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Furthermore, the most common platform immunoassay in use in the United States gives significantly different results in the critical range of 9 to 118 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (2 to 26.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L)</span> compared with a gold standard immunometric assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal values</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma corticotropin (ACTH) concentrations are usually between 10 and 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (2.2 and 13.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L)</span> at 8 AM.

This circadian rhythm in plasma ACTH concentrations is the cause of the parallel changes in cortisol secretion by the adrenal glands and the resulting rhythm in serum cortisol concentrations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The time of day at which the sample is taken is an important determinant of the utility of the measurement of plasma ACTH, which is often best interpreted with a simultaneous measurement of serum cortisol.</p><p>In evaluating patients with <strong>adrenal insufficiency</strong>, measurements should be made in the morning, if possible, when plasma ACTH and serum cortisol concentrations are usually at their highest value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>). However, in urgent or emergent evaluation of patients with potential adrenal insufficiency (eg, in the intensive care unit or emergency department), blood samples should be drawn at any time before administration of glucocorticoid therapy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Morning (8 AM [range 6 to 10 AM]) plasma ACTH is high and serum cortisol is low in primary adrenal insufficiency. Elevated plasma ACTH with a concurrent low serum cortisol at any time can indicate primary adrenal insufficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both plasma ACTH and serum cortisol values are at the low end of the normal range or undetectable in secondary adrenal insufficiency (ie, hypopituitarism or isolated ACTH deficiency). This is also true in tertiary adrenal insufficiency (hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone [CRH] deficiency), although this is rare and difficult to establish clinically. These values are inappropriately low for the degree of hypocortisolism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In congenital adrenal hyperplasia, early morning plasma ACTH values tend to be high, whereas serum cortisol may be normal or low, depending upon the severity of the enzyme deficiency.</p><p/><p>Late evening plasma ACTH and serum cortisol values are of little value in diagnosing primary adrenal insufficiency or congenital adrenal hyperplasia, although evening plasma ACTH concentrations tend to be somewhat high in these disorders.</p><p>In the different forms of <strong>Cushing's syndrome</strong>, plasma ACTH and serum cortisol concentrations are most helpful when measured in the late evening, the time at which the concentrations are usually near their nadir in normal persons. These samples must be taken without stress, and this is impractical in most clinical circumstances. Whereas morning values may be within the normal range, there is loss of the normal circadian rhythm in secretion in Cushing's syndrome and the evening values are usually higher than normal. However, for the diagnostic purpose of distinguishing between ACTH-dependent tumors and primary adrenal causes of Cushing's syndrome, ACTH can be measured at any time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The values for both tend to be higher in the ectopic ACTH syndrome than in Cushing's disease, but there is considerable overlap (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-the-cause-of-cushings-syndrome#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing the cause of Cushing's syndrome&quot;, section on 'ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome'</a>). The morning plasma ACTH levels are often normal, but can be inappropriately elevated for the degree of hypercortisolism.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pitfalls in measurement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors may influence plasma ACTH assay results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ACTH may be unstable in blood at room temperature, is cleaved by enzymes in blood cells and platelets, and adheres to glass and some plastic surfaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Therefore, how blood is collected and plasma is prepared and stored may markedly affect the measured ACTH concentration; the severity of this problem varies with the antibodies used in the assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In general, it is recommended that ACTH blood samples be drawn into plastic tubes with EDTA and kept on ice until centrifugation, separation, and freezing of the plasma sample.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">ACTH secretion in primary adrenal insufficiency, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome is episodic. Because the plasma disappearance half-time is measured in minutes, measurement of more than two samples may be useful, particularly if the initial result is equivocal. This can be done by obtaining samples at the same time on multiple days or by obtaining samples 30 to 60 minutes apart on the same day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal subjects and patients with adrenal disorders may respond rapidly to stress with increased ACTH secretion. For this reason, blood samples should be obtained with indwelling needles or catheters. Measurements in samples that require more than two or three minutes to obtain by venipuncture must be interpreted with caution, if high. For the same reason, it is best not to obtain post-sleep values the first night in the hospital before the patient is acclimated to a new environment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with major depressive disorder, particularly older patients with severe melancholic depression, may have increased plasma ACTH concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-the-diagnosis-of-cushings-syndrome#H853123632\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome&quot;, section on 'Exclude physiologic hypercortisolism'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One must be certain that the patient is not taking or has not recently taken glucocorticoids, which can acutely or chronically suppress hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two-site &quot;sandwich&quot; immunoassays for ACTH use two different monoclonal or affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies. They may not react with proopiomelanocortin (POMC) or forms intermediate between POMC and ACTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/1,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,11</a>]. This specificity may be a <strong>disadvantage</strong> in diagnosing the ectopic ACTH syndrome, in which a large percentage of circulating immunoreactive ACTH may represent incompletely processed or unprocessed POMC (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Other POMC-derived peptides'</a> below). POMC concentrations can be reliably measured only with a two-site POMC immunoassay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], although this measurement is not widely commercially available.</p><p/><p>In addition, excessive concentrations of ACTH fragments, such as ACTH-(1-24), can compete for binding to one or the other of the two antibodies, preventing intact ACTH from coupling to both antibodies and causing factitiously low ACTH concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This is unlikely to be a problem in measuring endogenous ACTH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CRH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like many other peptide hormones, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is measured by radioimmunoassay or enzyme-linked immunoassay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In humans, CRH is largely bound to a plasma CRH-binding protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>] and must be extracted by immunoaffinity chromatography or methanol before assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>Peripheral plasma CRH concentrations range from about 1 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (0.2 to 2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L),</span> increasing progressively during pregnancy to as high as 2700 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (585 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19</a>]. The increased CRH in peripheral plasma in pregnant women is presumably produced by the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Most of the CRH is bound to CRH-binding protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The net effect of the increase in CRH is that maternal pituitary corticotropin (ACTH) secretion, plasma ACTH and serum cortisol concentrations, and urinary and salivary cortisol excretion increase during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This effect is gradual, apparently because the concentration of the CRH-binding protein falls during late pregnancy, resulting in a greater concentration of free bioactive CRH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Despite an early report to the contrary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], peripheral plasma CRH concentrations do not correlate with plasma ACTH or serum cortisol concentrations or with altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function (eg, in primary adrenal insufficiency or Cushing's syndrome, or during insulin-induced hypoglycemia or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> administration). Some investigators reported a correlation between plasma CRH and plasma ACTH or serum cortisol in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], but others have not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>Plasma CRH concentrations are also high in the ectopic CRH syndrome, which is the one clinical setting in which measuring peripheral plasma CRH is of value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER POMC-DERIVED PEPTIDES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is currently no clinical indication for measuring<strong><em> </em></strong>non-corticotropin (ACTH) proopiomelanocortin (POMC) hormones.<strong><em> </em></strong>POMC is the ACTH precursor peptide. It is also the source of beta-lipotropin (beta-LPH). In addition, ACTH and beta-LPH are cleaved further to yield alpha- and beta-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH and beta-MSH), beta-endorphin, and met-enkephalin.</p><p>There is disagreement about the degree to which POMC is normally processed in the anterior pituitary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>], and differential processing may take place in different subpopulations of anterior pituitary corticotrophs. Therefore, POMC-derived peptides may not necessarily be released in equimolar concentrations. Furthermore, they appear to be metabolized at different rates, so that one may persist longer than others in the circulation. They are, however, released in concert so that their concentrations change in parallel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Thus, the peripheral plasma concentrations of these hormones provide a direct index of pituitary secretion. </p><p>Radioimmunoassays and enzyme-linked immunoassays have been developed for POMC itself and other POMC-derived peptides, including alpha- and beta-MSH, beta-LPH, beta-endorphin, the N-terminal peptide of POMC, and the joining peptide between the N-terminal peptide and ACTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-acth-crh-and-other-hypothalamic-and-pituitary-peptides/abstract/12,31,34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,31,34-38</a>].
