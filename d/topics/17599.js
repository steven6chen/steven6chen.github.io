Screening programs have been established in most developed countries to detect and treat this disorder, which affects approximately 1 in 2000 to 1 in 4000 newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Delays in diagnosis and treatment of congenital hypothyroidism will result in impaired neurocognitive outcome (as measured by intelligence quotient [IQ]). Even after diagnosis, IQ and neurologic development may suffer if the infant has hypothyroidism during the first two to three years of life, a time of critical brain dependence on thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism in such infants may result from inadequate treatment during the first two to three years of life, as might occur with poor adherence to daily administration of medication or lack of appropriate monitoring and thyroid hormone dose adjustments. Thus, appropriate initial therapy and follow-up are essential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall goals of treatment are to assure normal growth and development and psychometric outcome similar to genetic potential, by restoring the serum T4 concentration rapidly to the normal range followed by continued clinical and biochemical euthyroidism.</p><p>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">levothyroxine</a> (L-T4) is the treatment of choice. Although triiodothyronine (T3) is the biologically active hormone, the majority of brain T3 is derived from local deiodination of T4; thus, it is not necessary to use T3. To correct hypothyroxinemia as rapidly as possible, treatment should be initiated in an infant with a clearly positive screening test as soon as confirmatory blood samples have been drawn, pending results. In cases in which screening tests are borderline, a treatment decision can be made after results of the confirmatory tests return [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism&quot;, section on 'Newborn screening'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose of L-T4</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both the timing and dose of thyroid hormone replacement are important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology (ESPE), and the American Thyroid Association (ATA) recommend a starting L-T4 dose of 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/4,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,9</a>]. Considering that the lowest dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">levothyroxine</a> tablets are 25 or 50 mcg, this usually amounts to 37.5 or 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> in full-size term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In preterm and other low-birth weight infants, we also recommend using 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per day, though in milder cases, often characterized by delayed TSH elevation, a starting dose of 8 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per day is sufficient to normalize thyroid function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-physiology-and-screening-in-preterm-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid physiology and screening in preterm infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The initial goal of treatment should be to restore the serum T4 concentration to &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (&gt;129 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> or a serum free T4 (fT4) in the upper one-half of the normal range for age as rapidly as possible. A secondary goal is to normalize serum TSH, which may take up to two to four weeks after initiating treatment. In one small study, patients who took longer than two weeks to normalize their thyroid function had lower cognitive, attention, and achievement scores than those who achieved normal function within two weeks after therapy was started [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Full-scale IQ scores were 11 points higher in those started on 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> versus 37.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], likely because there is an inverse correlation between the starting L-T4 dose and the time to achieve the goal serum T4 concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In a literature review identifying 11 studies evaluating the age of onset of thyroid hormone treatment, infants started &quot;early&quot; (12 to 30 days of age) had a mean intelligence quotient (IQ) 15.7 points higher than infants started &quot;later&quot; (&gt;30 days of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>For infants with severe hypothyroidism (eg, those with a pretreatment serum total T4 &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> [&lt;65 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> or a free T4 &lt;0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (&lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L),</span> we suggest selecting a dose in the upper one-half of the recommended range (ie, 12.5 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/day)</span>. This is because rapid replacement with adequate doses of L-T4 is particularly important in infants with severe hypothyroidism. This was illustrated in an observational study of 61 infants with congenital hypothyroidism who were treated early versus late (&lt; or &ge;13 days of age) with a high versus low starting dose of L-T4 (&ge; or &lt;9.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In infants with more severe hypothyroidism (mean baseline serum free T4 = 0.21 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL),</span> only those treated early with high-dose L-T4 achieved normal psychomotor development at 10 to 30 months. In infants with mild hypothyroidism (mean baseline serum free T4 = 0.67 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL),</span> all achieved normal psychomotor development except for those treated late with a low starting dose. Re-evaluation of mental, psychomotor and behavioral development at six years of age found that global IQ was the same as control patients matched by age and socioeconomic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, visuomotor and verbal test scores were lower in patients with congenital hypothyroidism compared with control children. Patients who were treated late with a low starting dose had lower verbal scores compared with other patients with congenital hypothyroidism. The feasibility and safety of tailoring the starting dose of L-T4 to severity of hypothyroidism was confirmed by a study in which infants with more severe hypothyroidism were given a higher initial L-T4 dose than those with milder hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This approach rapidly normalized serum fT4 levels without producing persistent hyperthyroxinemia.</p><p>Only L-T4 tablets should be used. There are no approved liquid preparations in the United States (although these are available in Europe), and thyroid suspensions prepared by individual pharmacists may result in unreliable dosing. The L-T4 tablet should be crushed, mixed with breast milk, formula, or water, and fed to the infant. The tablets should <strong>not</strong> be mixed with soy formulas or any preparation containing concentrated iron or calcium, both of which reduce the absorption of L-T4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Antacids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aluminum-hydroxide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aluminum hydroxide</a>) or infant &quot;colic&quot; drops (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=simethicone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">simethicone</a>) also may interfere with L-T4 absorption, and should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The absorption of L-T4 is somewhat reduced by administration with food and formula. However, requiring that L-T4 be given separately from meals may be difficult for the family and reduce compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thus, instead of requiring L-T4 administration on an empty stomach, we ask the family to be consistent in how they administer the medication, in both time of day and with or without food. The L-T4 dose then can be adjusted based on serum fT4 (or T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of soy protein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Case reports have raised concern that soy protein may affect the absorption <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> metabolism of L-T4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>]. As an example, TSH concentrations, L-T4 dose, and growth parameters were compared between eight infants with congenital hypothyroidism who were fed soy formula and 70 who were fed a non-soy diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Despite similar pretreatment TSH concentrations, after initiation of L-T4 therapy, infants fed a soy diet achieved normal TSH (&lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> much more slowly (median of 150 versus 40 days in infants fed a non-soy diet). T4 concentrations and growth parameters were similar in both groups; measures of neuropsychological development were not available. Infants with congenital hypothyroidism in whom soy formula is indicated should be monitored closely with serum T4 and TSH, and the dose of L-T4 should be increased as necessary to achieve normal thyroid function tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The aim of treatment is to normalize serum TSH and keep the serum T4 or fT4 concentration in the upper one-half of the pediatric reference range. In the first year of life, the upper one-half of serum T4 values should be 10 to 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (130 to 206 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span>. Comparable recommendations for serum fT4 vary with the assay method used in the testing laboratory. For example, if the reference range for a specific fT4 assay method is 0.8 to 2.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL,</span> the aim of treatment would be to keep the serum fT4 between 1.4 and 2.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (18 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The serum TSH concentration should be less than 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> and optimally 0.5 to 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span>. Studies using the recommended starting L-T4 dose of 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/day</span> report that serum fT4 levels often are elevated, but T3 and TSH levels are normal; overall this so-called &quot;high dose&quot; L-T4 treatment achieved optimal cognitive outcome despite some cases with supra-normal free T4 values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Using the recommended high starting dose also achieved normal growth and school progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, overtreatment also can lead to complications and should be avoided. Persistently high serum T4 or fT4 concentrations for age, especially if T4 is above 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (206 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> or fT4 above 2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (30.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L),</span> may adversely affect the tempo of brain development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], have adverse effects on cognitive development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], temperament [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] or attention span [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and cause premature craniosynostosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommended follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical evaluation should be performed every few months during the first three years of life. Laboratory evaluation should be carried out more often to ensure optimal L-T4 dose. The European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology recommends measurement of serum T4 or fT4 and TSH according to the following schedule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At 2 weeks after the initiation of L-T4 treatment, and every 2 weeks until serum TSH level is normalized </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every 1 to 3 months during the first 12 months of life (in infants with moderate to severe hypothyroidism, we typically monitor on the frequent end of this range, as explained below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every 2 to 4 months between 1 and 3 years of age (but we suggest every 1 to 3 months)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every 6 to 12 months thereafter until growth is complete</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four to six weeks after any change in dose</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At more frequent intervals when compliance is questioned or abnormal results are obtained</p><p/><p>A more frequent monitoring schedule than that outlined above may be advisable in some infants and young children: one study found that monthly monitoring during the first year of life led to a dose adjustment in 75 percent of infants younger than six months, and in 36 percent of infants between 6 and 12 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Another study reported that infants with higher baseline serum TSH and lower T4 levels were the patients more likely to require frequent monitoring in the first year of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Based on these studies and personal experience, we recommend slight revisions to the monitoring schedules for the first 12 months and between 1 and 3 years, as noted above (in parentheses). Monitoring at these intervals should help avoid prolonged under- or over-treatment.</p><p>The serum T4 concentration should become normal within one to two weeks, and serum TSH should be normal in most infants after one month of treatment. Some infants may have a high serum TSH concentration (10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> despite serum T4 values in the upper one-half of the normal range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Conversely, when serum TSH is normal, some infants will have elevated serum fT4 levels, above the reference range for age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This appears to be the result of resetting of the pituitary-thyroid feedback threshold because of intrauterine hypothyroidism. In a study of 42 patients with congenital hypothyroidism, this mild to moderate thyroid hormone resistance was more common in infants (less than one year of age) than in older children (43 versus 10 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. These data suggest the resistance improves with age, but can persist. A few studies in infants and children with congenital hypothyroidism and thyroid hormone resistance found that a combination of L-T4 and T3 treatment lowered high TSH levels into the normal range with concomitant normal serum T4 and T3 levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. As the benefits of such treatment have been reported in only a small number of patients, we do not recommend routine combination treatment in patients with thyroid hormone resistance, particularly in infants, until further studies are performed.</p><p>While the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers all forms of L-T4 to be bioequivalent, a more recent prospective, randomized crossover study concluded that generic and brand-name L-T4 are not bioequivalent for children with severe congenital hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], while another retrospective study found no differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Consequently, if an infant is switched from brand to generic, or from one brand to another brand, or one manufacturer of generic to another manufacturer of generic L-T4, we recommend checking serum TSH and fT4 after six weeks to determine if a dosing adjustment is required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of permanent versus transient hypothyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with congenital hypothyroidism have transient hypothyroidism. A study of health insurance claims data (both privately insured and Medicaid-enrolled patients) in children diagnosed with congenital hypothyroidism found that 38 percent had discontinued thyroid hormone replacement after 36 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. While the reason for discontinuation of treatment was unknown, the speculation was that many of these patients had transient hypothyroidism. Transient hypothyroidism is more common in populations affected by iodine deficiency, and can also be caused by maternal autoimmune thyroid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. </p><p>Any of the following findings can provide evidence of permanent hypothyroidism:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radionuclide imaging <strong>and</strong> ultrasonography of the thyroid gland (if performed) showing ectopic thyroid gland or absent thyroid tissue, or studies confirming dyshormonogenesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A rise in the serum TSH concentration to above 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> after the first year of life in the setting of insufficient L-T4 replacement. Conversely, infants who have never had an abnormal TSH elevation on treatment or never required an increase in L-T4 dose are more likely to have transient hypothyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If permanent hypothyroidism has not been established by one of the above findings, L-T4 therapy can be discontinued for 30 days after age 3 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. If a low serum T4 or fT4 and high TSH concentration are found, permanent hypothyroidism is confirmed and treatment should be restarted. If the serum T4 or fT4 and TSH values remain normal, transient hypothyroidism is presumed. These children should still be examined periodically, and if they have any suspicious clinical features of hypothyroidism, such as slowing of growth, laboratory assessment of thyroid status should be performed. If the results are inconclusive, careful follow-up and subsequent retesting are indicated.</p><p/><p>The radionucleotide imaging and thyroid ultrasonography described above are considered optional at initial diagnosis because in most cases the results are not required for management decisions. Some clinicians elect to perform these studies after age three years in cases where permanent hypothyroidism has not been established. In a report of 33 children with congenital hypothyroidism who underwent re-evaluation at age three years, 27 percent had an absent or ectopic thyroid, 36 percent had dyshormonogenesis, and 36 percent had transient hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>The dose of L-T4 required to maintain euthyroidism can also help to predict the likelihood of transient versus permanent hypothyroidism. A study of infants with congenital hypothyroidism and a eutopic gland by ultrasound reported that those patients who eventually were determined to have transient hypothyroidism at age three years were on lower doses of L-T4 at both 12 and 24 months of age as compared with patients who had permanent hypothyroidism (&lt;1.45 versus &gt;4.27 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In another study, the average dose of L-T4 at the time of discontinuation was lower among children with transient hypothyroidism than those with permanent hypothyroidism (2.0 versus 2.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients in whom congenital hypothyroidism proves to be permanent (about 80 to 90 percent of cases of congenital hypothyroidism in North America) will require thyroid hormone replacement throughout life. These patients are managed by titrating L-T4 dose based on periodic measurements of serum TSH and fT4 or T4, as for an adolescent or adult with acquired hypothyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-hypothyroidism-in-childhood-and-adolescence#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired hypothyroidism in childhood and adolescence&quot;, section on 'T4 dose'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several programs, primarily in North America, Europe, and Australia, have reported long-term follow-up of infants detected through newborn screening. In general, these infants grow and develop normally. The psychometric outcome is much improved over the prescreening era, but some severely affected infants or those who are inadequately treated in the first two or three years of life have intelligence quotients (IQs) below those of normal children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth and cardiac function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term follow-up of children with congenital hypothyroidism detected by newborn screening shows that treated children have normal growth patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] and normal adult height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Moreover, a study comparing high versus low initial doses of L-T4 did not show any untoward effect of the higher dose on linear growth up to 18 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Other series have suggested possible metabolic abnormalities in children with treated hypothyroidism: a study from Switzerland reported an increased risk for overweight at age five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Another study investigating cardiac function in young adults with congenital hypothyroidism reported left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, impaired exercise capacity, and increased intima-media thickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The significance of these findings is unknown; they need to be confirmed by other investigators.</p><p>A national population-based study from France reported a slightly higher all-cause mortality (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 1.24) in patients with congenital hypothyroidism diagnosed in the first decade of newborn screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. SMR was highest for diseases of the central nervous system (SMR 5.22) and congenital malformations (SMR 3.15). In addition, the risk of developing an associated chronic disease was twice as high as the reference population.

In contrast to the findings from a previous study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], there was no difference between patients treated with high dose versus low dose thyroxine in memory testing and behavior problems when evaluated at 20 years of age.

Two of the studies reported no effect, while six reported that lower starting doses resulted in lower IQ outcome, averaging 12.3 points. Of note, two studies reported that lower starting doses led to a better IQ outcome, averaging 8.6 points, as compared to higher doses.

Subjects were more likely to still be living with their parents and less likely to secure full-time employment. These adults were born in the first years of their respective screening programs and were started on treatment at a later age.

Hearing loss was seen more frequently in patients with athyreosis and gland in situ (suggesting a link to dyshormonogenesis, such as Pendred syndrome) but not in patients with an ectopic gland. The hearing loss was sensorineural and associated with disease severity at the time of diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism (as measured by bone maturation delay at the time of the neonatal diagnosis); it required a hearing aid in 17 percent of affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Their children, when tested at age 7 to 9 years, had a mean IQ score of 103, as compared with a score of 107 in 124 children of mothers who were euthyroid during pregnancy. In addition, the children whose mothers were hypothyroid had more school learning problems or had more frequently repeated a grade compared to those with mothers who were euthyroid.</p><p>Other studies have reported that low maternal serum T4 values early in pregnancy are associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/64-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-67</a>]. This was illustrated in a study that evaluated the mental and motor functions of 63 infants whose mothers had serum fT4 values below the 10th percentile (fT4 concentration &lt;0.94 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL,</span> [&lt;12.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L])</span> during the 12th week of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. In these infants, both motor and mental functions (evaluated by Bayley Scales of Infant Development) were delayed at one and two years of age compared with infants whose mothers had fT4 values between the 50th and 90th percentile (fT4 concentration between 1.21 and 1.48 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dl</span> [15.6 and 19.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L</span> levels]). In a subsequent study of 108 infants born to mothers with low maternal fT4 levels at 12 weeks gestation, infants had a lower score on the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) &quot;orientation index&quot; at three weeks of age compared with infants with higher maternal fT4 levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. It should be noted that the &quot;orientation index&quot; was only one of seven NBAS &quot;cluster scores&quot; that achieved statistical significance. In observing neurodevelopmental outcomes soon after birth, this study avoids many possible confounding factors that may alter developmental outcomes when these are evaluated later in life. Furthermore, in a population-based cohort study from the Netherlands of 3659 children and their mothers, mild maternal hypothyroxinemia at 13 weeks gestation was associated with a higher risk of expressive language delay in the offspring, and a severe maternal hypothyroxinemia was associated with a higher risk of nonverbal cognitive delay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>Another study of 3727 mother-child pairs from the Netherlands found a 4.3 point lower IQ score at six years of age in offspring born to mothers with hypothyroxinemia, as defined by a serum FT4 in the lowest 5<sup>th</sup> percentile (obtained at a mean of 13.5 weeks gestation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-congenital-hypothyroidism/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Brain morphology as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including measurement of brain volume, cortical thickness, and surface area, was not different in these subjects as compared with offspring born to euthyroxinemic women.

Treatment should be initiated in an infant with a clearly positive screening test as soon as confirmatory blood samples have been drawn, pending results. In cases in which screening tests are borderline, a treatment decision can be made after results of the confirmatory tests become available. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with suspected congenital hypothyroidism should be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">levothyroxine</a> (L-T4) by mouth, starting at a dose of 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per day. We suggest tailoring the starting L-T4 dose to the severity of hypothyroidism, using doses on the upper end of this range (usually 37.5 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> in full-sized term infants) for neonates with more severe hypothyroidism (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Dose of L-T4'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The aim of treatment is to keep the serum T4 or free T4 (fT4) concentration in the upper one-half of the pediatric reference range and to normalize the serum TSH. Target values during the first year of life are (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Treatment goals'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serum T4: 10 to 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (130 to 206 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serum fT4: target varies with the assay method; for example, if the normal reference range is 0.8 to 2.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL,</span> aim for 1.4 to 2.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (18 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L)</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH): 0.5 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants and children should be monitored closely during treatment, and the L-T4 dose adjusted to maintain serum T4 or fT4 and TSH levels in the target ranges.

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Recommended follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Some infants with congenital hypothyroidism have mild serum TSH elevations despite free T4 levels at the upper end of the reference range, suggesting thyroid hormone resistance. In these cases, it is best to base dose adjustments on the free T4 level, rather than increasing the L-T4 dose to normalize TSH, which may result in thyrotoxic clinical features.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other infants manifest mild elevations of serum free T4, associated with normal TSH (and T3 if measured) and no clinical thyrotoxic features. These findings are common in appropriately treated infants, and no adjustment of the L-T4 dose is needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Up to 30 percent of children with congenital hypothyroidism have a transient form and will regain normal endogenous thyroid function during early life. Therefore, in those cases where permanent congenital hypothyroidism has not been established, thyroid function should be re-evaluated around three years of age to determine whether the hypothyroidism is permanent or transient. In most cases, this is done by discontinuing therapy for 30 days and measuring serum TSH and fT4. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of permanent versus transient hypothyroidism'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For infants with congenital hypothyroidism who are treated early (treatment begun between two and six weeks of life) and appropriately treated through the first three years of life, the prognosis for mental and physical development is good. The prognosis worsens for infants who are detected later, have more severe hypothyroidism, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who receive inadequate doses of L-T4.
