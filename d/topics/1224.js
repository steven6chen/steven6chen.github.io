In a survey study in which wound care professionals in Germany reported the etiologies of chronic leg ulcers in over 31,000 patients, venous insufficiency, arterial insufficiency, and mixed venous and arterial insufficiency accounted for 48, 15, and 18 percent of chronic ulcers, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-differential-diagnosis-of-leg-ulcers/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Ulcers caused by a combination of venous insufficiency and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are increasingly diagnosed, an observation related to the increasing incidence of atherosclerosis and obesity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530219356\"><span class=\"h2\">Venous insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic venous disease is the most common cause of leg ulcers. Examples of risk factors include advancing age, female sex, obesity, pregnancy, prolonged standing, and a history of deep venous thrombosis.

The skin immediately above the medial or lateral malleolus is the most common site, with the medial aspect affected most frequently. Ulcers are typically shallow with irregular borders with yellow, fibrinous exudate overlying the wound bed. Pain is mild to moderate. Arterial pulses are normal unless there is concomitant arterial insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H530219362\" class=\"local\">'Arterial insufficiency'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional clinical findings in chronic venous disease include telangiectasias of the feet and ankles, peripheral edema, venous varicosities, and brown discoloration of the lower legs and feet due to hemosiderin deposition in tissue macrophages. Venous stasis dermatitis characterized by erythema and scaling may develop around ulcers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F104173\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104173 \">picture 1</a>). Lipodermatosclerosis, also known as sclerosing panniculitis, may develop in the setting of long-standing venous hypertension and insufficiency. Lipodermatosclerosis presents as induration and fibrosis of the lower medial leg, which may be erythematous and painful and mistaken for cellulitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F65447\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65447 \">picture 2</a>).

Ulcers have well-demarcated edges, giving them a &quot;punched-out&quot; appearance, often with an overlying necrotic eschar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F104174\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104174 \">picture 3</a>). Unlike venous ulcers, arterial ulcers typically are very painful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with PAD may complain of intermittent claudication or, later, rest pain. On examination, decreased hair density, shiny and thin skin, diminished or absent peripheral pulses, or prolonged capillary refill time (&gt;3 to 4 seconds) may be present. Prolonged pallor with leg elevation to 45&deg; for 1 minute (Buerger's test) supports vascular compromise. Peripheral dry gangrene may occur with disease progression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease#H482053999\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of lower extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diagnosis </strong>&ndash; Peripheral arterial disease should be confirmed with ankle-brachial index (ABI) testing.

Diabetic patients may have up to a 25 percent lifetime risk of developing a foot ulcer. Other causes of peripheral neuropathy (eg, spinal cord disorders [injury or spina bifida], tabes dorsalis, alcohol abuse, nutritional deficiencies, and autoimmune diseases) may result in similar ulcerations.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical features </strong>&ndash; Neuropathic ulcers are painless and occur over pressure points on the foot or heel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F105301\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105301 \">table 2</a>). Ulcers have a punched-out morphology and typically occur within a thick callus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F104175\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104175 \">picture 4</a>). Associated clinical findings of diabetic neuropathy include claw toes, neuropathic (Charcot) arthropathy, and reduced sweating resulting in dry, scaly feet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51991\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51991 \">picture 5</a>).

Ulcers can become deep, and underlying osteomyelitis should be considered when ulcers do not heal with off-loading therapies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-diabetic-foot-ulcers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of diabetic foot ulcers&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530219374\"><span class=\"h1\">LESS COMMON CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple less common causes of leg ulcers, including physical injury, infection, vasculopathy, pyoderma gangrenosum (PG), panniculitis, malignancy, medications, and brown-recluse spider envenomation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F105315\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105315 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H530219380\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical injury to the skin may cause ulceration. Ulcers may result from pressure, thermal injury (burns or cold injury), radiation exposure, iatrogenic injury, or factitial (self-induced) injury. Of note, traumatic ulcers on the lower legs can demonstrate prolonged healing in older individuals and patients with underlying venous hypertension or arterial insufficiency.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical features </strong>&ndash; Ulcer features vary depending on the inciting injury. In particular, pressure ulcers often occur in sites overlying bony prominences; on the lower extremity, the heels are common sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-differential-diagnosis-of-leg-ulcers/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The appearance of pressure ulcers ranges from shallow open ulcers to deep ulcers that expose bone, tendon, or muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F104176\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104176 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50125\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50125 \">figure 1</a>).

Cutaneous ulcers also may result from atypical mycobacterial infections, late-stage syphilis (gummas) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F104182\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef104182 \">picture 7</a>), deep fungal infections (eg, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, histoplasmosis), and protozoal infections (eg, leishmaniasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F86992\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86992 \">picture 8</a>)). These infections most commonly, but not exclusively, occur in immunosuppressed patients.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical features </strong>&ndash; Clinical features vary according to the type of infection. Furuncles secondary to methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) may progress to form larger abscesses, cellulitis, or ulcerative, necrotic plaques. Ecthyma, a form of nonbullous impetigo caused by <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> (with frequent contamination with <em>S. aureus</em>), produces punched-out shallow ulcers with a purulent necrotic crust and surrounding erythema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F96273\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96273 \">picture 9</a>). Ecthyma gangrenosum, a <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> infection characterized by bacterial invasion of the media and adventitia of arteries and veins, results in the rapid development of gangrenous ulcers with black eschar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F97674\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97674 \">picture 10</a>). Ecthyma gangrenosum usually occurs in immunocompromised patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=impetigo\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Impetigo&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections#H1133434152\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa skin and soft tissue infections&quot;, section on 'Ecthyma Gangrenosum'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diagnosis </strong>&ndash; The diagnosis of infectious ulcers requires identification of the causative organism via swab cultures for aerobic bacteria or tissue culture for bacteria, fungi, and atypical mycobacteria. For tissue culture, incisional or punch biopsies should be obtained from the edge of the ulcer, placed on a sterile gauze pad moistened with non-bacteriostatic saline, and sent for culture in a sterile urine cup. In addition, ulcer edge tissue should be sent for histopathologic examination, including special stains for infectious organisms, since this may yield a more rapid diagnosis than culture. Culture can take up to six weeks for certain mycobacteria and fungi.</p><p/><p>In addition, secondary bacterial infection can complicate chronic ulcers caused by venous insufficiency, arterial insufficiency, neuropathic disease, or other etiologies. Clinical signs such as exacerbations of erythema, warmth, edema, and exudate warrant investigation for secondary infection.

Small-vessel vasculitis can be idiopathic or a consequence of infections, drugs, mixed cryoglobulinemia, autoimmune disorders (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sj&ouml;gren syndrome), or malignancies (particularly hematologic malignancies). Inflammation of both small and medium-sized cutaneous blood vessels is associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides, including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Wegener's granulomatosis), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss), and microscopic polyangiitis. Inflammation of medium-sized blood vessels occurs in cutaneous and systemic polyarteritis nodosa.

Palpable purpura may develop an overlying necrotic vesicle or bulla that becomes ulcerative. Subcutaneous nodules, necrotic ulcerations, retiform purpura, and livedo racemosa are features of medium-sized vessel involvement.

In cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis, biopsy of an early but palpable lesion is most informative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-differential-diagnosis-of-leg-ulcers/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Biopsies demonstrate leukocytoclastic vasculitis (infiltration of postcapillary venules by neutrophils undergoing degranulation and fragmentation) and fibrinoid necrosis of the involved vessels. Similar changes occur in vasculitis of medium-sized vessels involving the small arteries in the deep reticular dermis and fat. Performance of direct immunofluorescence studies to identify immunoglobulin or complement deposits is an important component of the evaluation of cutaneous vasculitis.

The disease is often bilateral, involving the skin around the ankle and dorsal foot. The ulcers heal with white, atrophic, stellate scars with telangiectasia, known as atrophie blanche. The terms atrophie blanche and livedoid vasculopathy have been used interchangeably in older literature; however, atrophie blanche is now recognized as a healing pattern that can occur as a result of both LV and chronic venous insufficiency.

(See <a href=\"#H530219350\" class=\"local\">'Common causes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H530219374\" class=\"local\">'Less common causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the differential diagnosis of leg ulcers is broad, the high frequency of venous insufficiency, arterial insufficiency, and neuropathic ulcers warrant strong consideration of these etiologies during patient evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F105301\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105301 \">table 2</a>). If findings are not consistent with these etiologies, less common causes of leg ulcers should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H477419\" class=\"local\">'Patient evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical findings that suggest venous insufficiency ulcers include location on the lower leg, particularly near the medial or lateral malleoli, and signs of chronic venous disease, such as edema, varicosities, hemosiderin deposition, or stasis dermatitis. Venous ulcers are usually shallow with irregular borders and overlying yellow, fibrinous exudate. (See <a href=\"#H530219356\" class=\"local\">'Venous insufficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical findings that suggest arterial insufficiency ulcers are painful, well-demarcated ulcers with a &quot;punched-out&quot; appearance located on toes or pressure areas. Associated clinical findings may include a shiny appearance to the skin, local hair loss, diminished pulses, and dry gangrene. (See <a href=\"#H530219362\" class=\"local\">'Arterial insufficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical findings that suggest neuropathic ulcers include painless, &quot;punched-out&quot; ulcers occurring over pressure points, usually on the foot or heel. A surrounding callus is common. Patients with diabetic neuropathy may also have claw toes, neuropathic (Charcot) arthropathy, and reduced sweating on the feet resulting in dry, scaly feet. (See <a href=\"#H530219368\" class=\"local\">'Neuropathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful assessment of the patient history and physical findings is often helpful for identifying less common causes of leg ulcers. Historical information such as the time course of ulcer development, underlying disease, or medication exposure can be useful. Recognition of associated physical findings such as palpable purpura, retiform purpura, or nodules can also aid in diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H477419\" class=\"local\">'Patient evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsies are not necessary for the diagnosis of most ulcers, but can be helpful when the diagnosis is uncertain. In particular, histopathologic examination may be helpful when the differential diagnosis includes vasculitis, microvascular occlusion syndromes, panniculitis, or malignancy. Additional laboratory or radiologic studies may be helpful for confirming the cause of an ulcer or evaluating for a suspected infection or associated underlying disease. (See <a href=\"#H477419\" class=\"local\">'Patient evaluation'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-differential-diagnosis-of-leg-ulcers/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Singer AJ, Tassiopoulos A, Kirsner RS.
