There are many management options for fibroid-related symptoms, including expectant management, medical therapy, non-excisional procedures (endometrial ablation, uterine artery embolization, magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound), and surgery (myomectomy, radiofrequency ablation, hysterectomy).<strong> </strong></p><p>Abdominal myomectomy (performed via laparotomy; also referred to as open myomectomy) was developed in the early 1900s as a conservative treatment for women with uterine myomas. Myomectomy is the surgical removal of leiomyomas from the uterus, leaving the uterus in place. This can be accomplished using an abdominal, laparoscopic, hysteroscopic, or vaginal approach. </p><p>Abdominal myomectomy will be reviewed here. General principles of the treatment of uterine leiomyomas, as well as laparoscopic, hysteroscopic, and vaginal myomectomy and techniques to reduce blood loss during myomectomy, are discussed separately.

For women in whom a leiomyomatous uterus makes it difficult to evaluate the adnexa, pelvic imaging should be performed only if symptoms of adnexal disease develop (eg, lower quadrant pelvic pain) or for selected women who require screening for ovarian cancer. If sonographic visualization of the ovaries is occluded by myomas, magnetic resonance imaging should be performed.

This is similar to laparoscopic myomectomy, but much shorter than abdominal myomectomy, which generally requires four to six weeks for recuperation. </p><p>Uterine artery embolization has been compared with open or laparoscopic myomectomy in only one randomized trial (n = 121) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There was no difference between groups in the rate of symptomatic relief after six months (89 versus 88 percent). This overall outcome does not specifically address treatment of bulk-related symptoms, since the results for bleeding, pain, and pressure symptoms were combined. Women who underwent uterine artery embolization compared with myomectomy had higher rates of complications (21 versus 16 percent) and of prolonged hospital stay (16 versus 10 percent), but these differences did not reach statistical significance. The reintervention rate after an average of two years was significantly higher for uterine artery embolization (33 versus 3 percent); reintervention was myomectomy in this study. Of note, however, the indication for most reinterventions in this study was the size of fibroids, not recurrence of symptoms. A similar difference in the reintervention rate was reported in a retrospective cohort study that compared uterine artery embolization with myomectomy (29 versus 3 percent at four years; interventions were myomectomy or repeat embolization) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Over the long-term, however, myomectomy also has a high rate of intervention. Studies with up to 7 to 10 years of follow-up report subsequent surgery for fibroid-related symptoms in 10 to 26 percent of women following myomectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. For embolization, studies with five or more years of follow-up have reported that 20 percent of women undergo subsequent surgery. High quality and long-term data are needed to address the comparative risk of reintervention for these two procedures. (See <a href=\"#H3250292\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound is not widely available and has not been evaluated in comparison with myomectomy.</p><p>In summary, uterine artery embolization and laparoscopic myomectomy are both minimally invasive approaches. Based upon available data, the risk of reintervention appears to be higher for uterine artery embolization, at least in the first several years after the procedure. As a result, we suggest laparoscopic myomectomy rather than embolization. Women who place a high priority on avoiding any abdominal incisions may reasonably choose embolization. Some women are not candidates for laparoscopic myomectomy. For these women, the advantages of a minimally invasive procedure outweigh the risk of reintervention. The clinician should counsel the patient about all options and choose the procedure based upon patient preference. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26149127\"><span class=\"h4\">Myomectomy versus hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who choose not to be treated with interventional radiology procedures may choose between myomectomy and hysterectomy. This choice largely depends upon the availability of minimally invasive procedures and patient preference. There are no high quality data comparing myomectomy and hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Traditionally, women with symptomatic fibroids who have completed childbearing have been counseled to undergo hysterectomy, but this approach is not supported by evidence or current practice. The rationale for counseling patients to undergo hysterectomy has been based upon two presumed benefits: hysterectomy eliminates the risk of future cervical or uterine pathology and hysterectomy has been thought to be associated with less blood loss and fewer complications than myomectomy. </p><p>Prevention of future cervical or uterine pathology is not a relevant indication for hysterectomy in current practice. Advances in cervical cancer screening and diagnosis and treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding have provided less invasive options. </p><p>In addition, myomectomy does <strong>not</strong> appear to have a higher risk of blood loss or complications than hysterectomy, according to observational data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The largest report was a retrospective study of 394 women with leiomyomatous uteri who underwent either abdominal myomectomy or hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Estimated blood loss (227 versus 484 mL) and the rate of hemorrhage, defined as &ge;500 mL blood loss (10 versus 14 percent) were significantly lower in the myomectomy group. The overall morbidity rate, adjusted for age, weight, and uterine size, was comparable in the two groups. A meta-analysis found similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The decision between myomectomy and hysterectomy must be individualized. The least invasive procedure should be chosen. Each patient should be counseled regarding the procedures for which she is eligible. This will depend primarily on the size, number, and location of fibroids. Based upon these factors, some women are candidates only for laparotomy.</p><p>For women who are eligible for all procedures, no studies have directly compared outcomes for the various minimally invasive approaches (laparoscopic myomectomy, with either vaginal or laparoscopic hysterectomy). Some factors that may affect a patient&rsquo;s decision include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hysterectomy offers the advantage of definitive treatment. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some women prefer myomectomy because they wish to conserve their uterus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies show a higher risk of injury to ureters, bladder and bowel with hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hysterectomy is associated with a risk of subsequent pelvic organ prolapse surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hysterectomy (with ovarian conservation) is associated with decreased anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone levels and may cause some women to enter menopause two to three years earlier than normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p>Some women desire definitive therapy, and are willing to accept a more invasive or extensive procedure to avoid the risk of recurrent symptoms. Hysterectomy rather than myomectomy is the appropriate choice for these women, since some women require further surgery following myomectomy. (See <a href=\"#H3250292\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>An increasing number of women wish to conserve their uterus as an important component of their body image. Women who are concerned about effects on sexual function should be counseled that most studies have found no impact of hysterectomy on sexual outcomes. Women who prefer to preserve their uterus, but do not plan future childbearing, are candidates for either myomectomy or interventional radiology procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing a route of hysterectomy for benign disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In some women, hysterectomy may be associated with subsequent pelvic organ prolapse. Consistent results from large observational studies show women who undergo a hysterectomy are at risk of having subsequent prolapse repair surgery. However, this risk may be limited to women for whom prolapse was the indication for undergoing hysterectomy. It is not certain whether undergoing a hysterectomy for fibroids is a risk factor for developing symptomatic prolapse. Also, many women have several risk factors for prolapse, including parity, advancing age, and obesity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-a-route-of-hysterectomy-for-benign-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing a route of hysterectomy for benign disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In general, for subserosal or intramural fibroids, there are more minimally invasive options for hysterectomy than myomectomy. More women are candidates for vaginal and laparoscopic hysterectomy than laparoscopic myomectomy, and more surgeons have the skills for less invasive approaches to hysterectomy. </p><p>Given these considerations, no overall recommendation can be made regarding myomectomy versus hysterectomy. Women who prefer definitive surgery require a hysterectomy. In contrast, those who desire uterine conservation should undergo myomectomy. For women who have, or are at increased risk for, pelvic organ prolapse, we suggest myomectomy rather than hysterectomy.

In the long-term, their use appears to increase the risk of persistent myomas. </p><p>Myomectomy can usually be performed using a Pfannenstiel incision, or if slightly more access is needed, a Maylard incision. Compared with a large vertical incision (eg, to the umbilicus or above), these incisions decrease postoperative pain and improve scar cosmesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. For large uterine size, making the transverse incision slightly higher than usual, extending the incision to the lateral borders of the rectus muscles and then curving it cephalad to avoid the ilioinguinal nerves will make myomectomy feasible. Larger fibroids attenuate the rectus muscles and fascia, making them more pliable and will allow access to the enlarged uterus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incisions-for-open-abdominal-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incisions for open abdominal surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For some women with large fibroids, a vertical incision may be required; however, use of GnRH agonists can reduce uterine size and allow use of a transverse or smaller vertical incision. A meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials demonstrated that pretreatment with a GnRH agonist compared with placebo or no treatment prior to abdominal myomectomy significantly reduced uterine size (uterine volume: 159 mL smaller; gestational size: 2.2 weeks less) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The only trial that evaluated choice of incision found that GnRH agonist use was associated with fewer vertical incisions (0 of 13 versus 5 of 15) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The disadvantages of preoperative GnRH therapy, however, outweigh the advantages for most women. Randomized trials have not found that use of these agents reduces the risk of blood transfusion. Also, many surgeons report that these medications result in increased difficulty enucleating fibroids and small randomized trials have found that their use increases the risk of persistent myomas. Thus, we suggest <strong>not</strong> using GnRH agonist pretreatment for women undergoing open myomectomy. Most women can have an abdominal myomectomy through a large Pfannenstiel incision, even for very large fibroids. By dissecting the fascia off of the rectus muscles, both in the midline and laterally up to the umbilicus, the rectus muscles can be spread further laterally to give the surgeon more room to deliver the uterus. Use of these agents (GnRH) may be a reasonable option in women for whom treatment would allow a transverse rather than a vertical incision and who place a high priority on type of surgical incision.

Careful planning and placement of uterine incisions can avoid inadvertent extension of the incision to the cornua or ascending uterine vessels.</p><p>The uterine incisions may be either vertical or transverse. The common teaching has been to make vertical incisions, to prevent transection of the arcuate arteries of the uterus, which run transversely. However, avoiding these vessels is not feasible since myomas distort normal vascular architecture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>Anterior uterine incisions are associated with fewer adnexal adhesions than posterior incisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, if the fibroids are in the posterior uterine wall, it is usually preferable to make a posterior incision to remove them rather than to go through the uterine cavity to remove them via an anterior incision.&nbsp;</p><p>Many surgeons make a uterine incision at a location through which all or most of the myomas can be removed. The rationale for this is that limiting the number of incisions reduces the likelihood of adhesions to the uterine serosa, although there are no data regarding the number of incisions and the risk of adhesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H427365\" class=\"local\">'Adhesive disease'</a> below.) Use of a single incision, however, requires that tunnels be created within the myometrium to extract distant myomas. These myometrial defects can be difficult to close, interfering with hemostasis. </p><p>Alternatively, an incision can be made directly over each myoma (or group of nearby or apposing myomas). This approach allows both easy removal of the myomas, as well as prompt closure of the myometrial defects to secure hemostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1366099\"><span class=\"h2\">Removal of myomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The uterine incision is extended down through the myometrium and entire fibroid pseudocapsule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72235\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72235 \">figure 3</a>).

Unfortunately, many large series of abdominal myomectomies have not reported data for relief of symptoms, patient satisfaction, or quality-of-life following surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/29,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,35-37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7665571\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistent or new myomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many women who undergo myomectomy will have leiomyomas upon subsequent evaluation. However, most of these women will not require additional treatment for fibroid-related symptoms. Surveillance for post-myomectomy myomas is not necessary, since imaging detects many clinically insignificant myomas. The outcome that is important to patients is the risk of recurrent symptoms that require additional treatment. &#160;</p><p>Myomas detected after myomectomy, often referred to as recurrent, are more accurately referred to as persistent or newly developed. Myomas persist when they are not removed or incompletely removed at the time of surgery. </p><p>Five to 10 years after myomectomy, 27 to 62 percent of women will have myomas detected by ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. Considering the background prevalence of leiomyomas (77 percent in a post-hysterectomy study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]), it is not surprising that new myomas continue to develop after excision. </p><p>Post-myomectomy myomas are more likely in women who have multiple versus single myomas at time of surgery (74 versus 11 percent in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]) and those who do not versus do have a pregnancy after myomectomy (30 versus 15 percent in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]). Preoperative use of GnRH agonists is associated with an increase in the risk of postoperative myomas.

The largest study (n = 568) was a nested case control study in which 21 percent of women who had undergone myomectomy (abdominal, laparoscopic, or hysteroscopic) had subsequent surgery within 1 to 10 years; the combination of surgical approaches limits the ability to apply these data to abdominal myomectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Another retrospective study of 47 women who had undergone abdominal myomectomy reported that, at an average of seven-year follow-up, 34 percent had subsequent surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-myomectomy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Risk factors for subsequent surgery are not well established.

(See <a href=\"#H25049674\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common indications for abdominal myomectomy are abnormal uterine bleeding or bulk-related symptoms (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">pelvic/abdominal</span> pain or pressure). Indications for which the benefit of myomectomy is unproven include: evaluation of pelvic malignancy (eg, ovarian or uterine cancer), infertility, and prevention of obstetric complications. (See <a href=\"#H14328797\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7945019\" class=\"local\">'Unproven indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women undergoing abdominal or laparoscopic myomectomy, we suggest <strong>not</strong> pretreating with GnRH agonists (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Use of these agents is a reasonable option in women for whom treatment would allow a transverse rather than a vertical incision and who place a high priority on type of surgical incision. (See <a href=\"#H623653\" class=\"local\">'Reducing uterine size with GnRH agonists'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-to-reduce-blood-loss-during-abdominal-or-laparoscopic-myomectomy#H1389439\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques to reduce blood loss during abdominal or laparoscopic myomectomy&quot;, section on 'GnRH agonists'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In our practice, we use prophylactic antibiotics for this procedure, since intraabdominal infection may adversely affect fertility. (See <a href=\"#H1253844\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with bulk-related symptoms of uterine leiomyomas, the decision regarding procedure depends upon patient characteristics and preferences (see <a href=\"#H748326\" class=\"local\">'Bulk-related symptoms'</a> above): &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The procedure of choice for women who desire future pregnancy is myomectomy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women who do not wish to preserve fertility and do not prefer definitive surgery, the choice must be individualized. Uterine artery embolization and laparoscopic myomectomy are the least invasive options; eligibility for each of these procedures depends upon patient (and fibroid) characteristics. For patients who are candidates for either of these procedures, we suggest laparoscopic myomectomy rather than uterine artery embolization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Women who place a high priority on avoiding abdominal incisions may reasonably choose embolization. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women who do not undergo an interventional radiology procedure and who have pelvic organ prolapse or have risk factors for prolapse (eg, increasing parity, obesity), we suggest myomectomy rather than hysterectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women who prefer definitive surgery, hysterectomy is required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All other women should choose the least invasive surgical approach for which they are eligible and that is available to them (eg, abdominal myomectomy, laparoscopic hysterectomy, vaginal hysterectomy). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood loss during myomectomy can be prevented or decreased with mechanical or pharmacologic methods. Allogeneic blood transfusion can be avoided by using methods of autologous blood transfusion.

Many women with post-myomectomy fever have no localized findings. (See <a href=\"#H7664617\" class=\"local\">'Fever and infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adhesion formation occurs in approximately 36 percent of women after myomectomy. (See <a href=\"#H427365\" class=\"local\">'Adhesive disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myomectomy relieves symptoms in 80 percent of women. The rate of subsequent surgery for fibroids following myomectomy is 21 to 34 percent.
