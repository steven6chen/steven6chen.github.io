It is an X-linked inborn error of the glycosphingolipid metabolic pathway. This results in accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) mostly within lysosomes in a wide variety of cells, thereby leading to the protean manifestations of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the renal manifestations of Fabry disease. Other clinical manifestations and the diagnosis and treatment of Fabry disease are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fabry-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fabry disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fabry-disease-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-cardiac-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fabry disease: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of cardiac disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fabry-disease-neurologic-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fabry disease: Neurologic manifestations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fabry-disease-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fabry disease: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1743369370\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal manifestations are common among male and, to a lesser extent, female patients with Fabry disease. Proteinuria, one of the initial renal findings, occurs in approximately 50 percent of untreated males with classic Fabry disease by the age of 35 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The prevalence of proteinuria in males increases with age, reaching approximately 90 percent by the age of 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Approximately 30 to 35 percent of females with Fabry disease have overt proteinuria (&gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> with an onset that is typically later than that in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2637368133\" class=\"local\">'Proteinuria'</a> below.)</p><p>A significant fraction of patients develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) and eventually end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In a study from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that included 105 males with classic Fabry disease, all patients who survived to the age of 55 years developed ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, larger studies that have included patients with classic Fabry disease as well as those with milder disease, such as those with later-onset variants, have reported a lower prevalence of ESRD. As an example, in a North American registry study of over 2000 patients with Fabry disease (mean age 37 to 40 years), the prevalence of ESRD was 14 percent in men and 2 percent in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. By age 55 years, only 32 percent of untreated men and 19 percent of untreated women developed renal events, which ranged from new-onset CKD (defined as a glomerular filtration rate [GFR] less than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) to ESRD. (See <a href=\"#H3591630331\" class=\"local\">'Chronic kidney disease'</a> below.)</p><p>The prevalence of Fabry disease in dialysis populations has been examined in several screening studies. Random screening has identified less than 1 percent of hemodialysis patients as having Fabry disease, most of whom were already known to have the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/6-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-12</a>]. The following findings from different regions are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>According to the 2017 annual data report by the United States Renal Data System, there were 243 Fabry disease patients receiving chronic dialysis in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Fabry disease accounted for 119 new cases of ESRD between 2011 and 2015, which represents approximately 0.03 percent of the incident patients each year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Japanese study, 6 of 514 (1.2 percent) consecutive males on dialysis had low leukocyte alpha-Gal A levels and were found to have a gene mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Another Japanese study of 696 consecutive patients (295 females) found only four males and one female (0.7 percent) to have Fabry disease, and three were already known to have it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a nationwide screen of the Austrian dialysis population, 85 of 2480 patients (3.4 percent, similar proportions in male and female) had a positive blood spot test with low alpha-Gal A levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among these patients, only 5 women and 10 men had confirmed low leukocyte alpha-Gal A levels, representing 0.5 percent of the screened population. Only four males (0.16 percent) had the gene mutation, three of whom were already diagnosed.</p><p/><p>As mentioned above, <a href=\"http://www.lsdregistry.net/fabryregistry&amp;token=v/8Tpt9w0LsKC1+8QK/bAZJF4rJE7y7tWx4Yl7Wjw62/jERZVVVBCQCAAZjQCOSO&amp;TOPIC_ID=115165\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">a voluntary international Fabry disease registry</a> has been established to better understand the epidemiology and prognosis of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2658408798\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) accumulation in the kidney is inversely correlated with residual alpha-Gal A activity in leukocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, the magnitude of renal Gb3 content correlates positively with the severity of renal pathologic changes and inversely with kidney function. Thus, accumulation of Gb3 in the kidney is probably responsible for the renal manifestations of the disease. (See <a href=\"#H4250050401\" class=\"local\">'Renal manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>Gb3 accumulation in the kidney occurs preferentially in the glomeruli (especially podocytes but also in endothelial, mesangial, and parietal epithelial cells), distal tubular cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells. The predilection for podocytes may explain the early renal manifestations of proteinuria. In children with Fabry disease, for example, podocyte Gb3 accumulation increased with age and was strongly associated with foot process width and the degree of proteinuria, implicating glomerular involvement in the early-onset proteinuria observed in this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, podocyte loss in the urine (podocyturia) is increased in patients with Fabry disease and correlates with the clinical severity of renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], suggesting that podocyte loss may be important in the progression of Fabry nephropathy.</p><p>The pathophysiology underlying the formation of renal sinus cysts, another manifestation in patients with Fabry disease, is unknown (see <a href=\"#H1736665416\" class=\"local\">'Renal sinus cysts'</a> below). The presence of cysts is not related to residual alpha-Gal A activity, renal function, or level of proteinuria. It is unclear whether the cysts contain Gb3 or whether this is due to lymphatic overload or other processes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3349972711\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kidney biopsy findings by light microscopy and electron microscopy are characteristic in Fabry disease, whereas immunofluorescence staining does not contribute to the diagnosis. Glycolipid accumulation is observed throughout the kidney:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Light microscopy shows vacuolization of visceral glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes) and distal tubular epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This is consistent with the described pattern of glycolipid accumulation, with podocytes and distal tubular cells showing the largest amount. Smaller deposits in cells of the mesangium, glomerular endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], proximal tubule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F54672%7ENEPH%2F75690\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54672 graphicRef75690 \">picture 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>], and in the endothelium of peritubular capillaries and arteries may be difficult to appreciate by routine light microscopy. Renal arteries and arterioles show smooth muscle cell globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) accumulation as well as smooth muscle degenerative changes. Such degenerative changes are already established in adolescent males with classic Fabry disease and likely contribute to the glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis characteristic of the later stages of Fabry renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On electron microscopy, deposits of Gb3 appear primarily within enlarged secondary lysosomes as lamellated membrane structures, called myeloid or zebra bodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F68849\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68849 \">picture 2</a>); however, localization in other cellular compartments may also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These inclusions, composed of concentric layers with a periodicity of 3.5 to 5 nm and with an onion skin appearance, are considered a <strong>hallmark</strong> of glycolipid storage disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p>The ultrastructural findings on kidney biopsy are highly characteristic and frequently point to the diagnosis. However, lamellar inclusions have been described in other conditions, such as silicosis, and with the use of cationic amphiphilic drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>, chlorphentermine, chlorcyclizine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]. The location of the inclusions is sometimes helpful in making the distinction between these diseases. Lamellar inclusions associated with gentamicin occur in proximal tubules, whereas, in Fabry disease, the inclusions are most striking in podocytes and distal tubules.</p><p>Nonspecific findings in patients with more advanced disease may include focal segmental and global glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis and inflammation, with nonspecific mesangial deposits staining for C3 and immunoglobulin M (IgM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Foam cells may also be seen but are not diagnostic of Fabry disease, as they may be seen in other lysosomal storage diseases (where lipid is in podocytes) and proteinuric states (where lipid is primarily in macrophages) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Thus, renal Gb3 content is significantly higher, and glomerular and tubulointerstitial changes and kidney function are worse, in patients with undetectable alpha-Gal A activity compared with those with greater than 1 percent of normal activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4250050401\"><span class=\"h1\">RENAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal manifestations occur in at least 50 percent of male patients and approximately 20 percent of female patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/1,2,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,28</a>]. When patients with Fabry disease present with renal manifestations, the principal findings are proteinuria followed by progressive renal insufficiency and often hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Uncommonly, patients complain of polyuria and polydipsia or are discovered by the presence of renal sinus cysts on an imaging study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2637368133\"><span class=\"h2\">Proteinuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proteinuria, which may be glomerular or tubular in origin, may begin in the early teen years but more typically appears during early adulthood. As an example, a long-term natural history study from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) reported proteinuria (defined as urine protein excretion &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> among 66 of 78 (85 percent) male patients with renal disease, with the average age of onset being 34 years (range 14 to 55 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Nephrotic-range proteinuria was uncommon (18 percent of those with renal disease), and only one-fourth of them developed nephrotic syndrome. However, among those with progressive kidney failure, 80 percent had nephrotic proteinuria.</p><p>Adult males with Fabry disease who have the highest levels of proteinuria (urine protein-to-creatinine ratio &gt;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/g)</span> also have the fastest decline in kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. In males with proteinuria of greater than 1 g per 24 hours, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) continues to decline despite long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, proteinuria is much less closely associated with renal function decline in adult female Fabry patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Thus, the concept that proteinuria is a direct promoter of progression in Fabry disease may be at least partly incorrect.</p><p>In addition to protein, the urine may contain oval fat bodies (tubular epithelial cells with lipid inclusions) with a lamellar structure and a Maltese cross pattern under polarized urine microscopy.

In the previously described natural history study from the NIH, the following findings were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Forty-eight percent developed CKD (defined as a serum creatinine concentration &ge;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [133 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]),</span> which occurred at a median age of 42 years.

Progression to ESRD from the diagnosis of CKD occurred over an average of four years (range 1 to 13 years), corresponding to a mean rate of decline in GFR of 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> per year. Once CKD developed, the rate of progression to ESRD did not vary with age.</p><p/><p>Similar findings with respect to CKD and ESRD were reported in an English cohort study of 98 hemizygous males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Eighty-four percent had proteinuria, and 47 percent had decreased kidney function. However, the 31 percent of patients who developed ESRD did so at a younger age than in the study from the United States, with a mean age of dialysis initiation of 37 years; the youngest presented at 18 years of age.</p><p>However, as discussed above, registry data that includes both classic Fabry patients and generally milder later-onset Fabry disease variants have found lower overall incidences of serious kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1743369370\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Although there are some conflicting observations in females, increased proteinuria in male patients with Fabry disease correlates with an increased risk of progression to ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/2,29,30,33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,29,30,33-35</a>]. One small observational study has found that reducing proteinuria with renin-angiotensin system blockade may help to stabilize GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]; however, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. (See <a href=\"#H2637368133\" class=\"local\">'Proteinuria'</a> above.)</p><p>ERT may slow the decline of renal function in patients with a mild reduction in GFR prior to the initiation of therapy but may have less benefit in patients with more advanced renal functional decline and proteinuria. A more detailed discussion of the effect of ERT on the incidence and progression of CKD is presented elsewhere.

Polyuria and polydipsia may be the earliest functional symptoms of Fabry renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fabry-disease-renal-manifestations/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].
