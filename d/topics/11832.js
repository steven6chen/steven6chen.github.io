Ischemic optic neuropathy is generally categorized as anterior (affecting the optic disc) versus posterior (retrobulbar), and as arteritic versus nonarteritic. Anterior involvement is usual with both arteritic and nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy.</p><p>Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is the most common form of ischemic optic neuropathy. It is an idiopathic, ischemic insult of the optic nerve head characterized by acute, monocular, painless visual loss with optic disc swelling.</p><p>This topic will discuss the prognosis and treatment of NAION. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, etiologies, clinical features, and diagnosis of NAION are discussed separately.

At baseline, 21 percent had a history or clinical evidence of NAION in the fellow eye. After a median follow-up of five years, 15 percent of patients developed NAION in the other eye, with a median interval between events of 1.2 years (range 16 days to 6 years).</p><p>Diabetes and worse baseline visual acuity in the affected eye have been identified as risk factors for recurrence, but older age, gender, hypertension, anemia, migraine, and smoking have not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarteritic-ischemic-optic-neuropathy-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

Younger patients may be at greater risk of recurrence. In a retrospective study of 164 patients less than 50 years in age, 5 percent had evidence of fellow eye involvement at baseline, 5 percent had simultaneous bilateral involvement, and 32 percent had sequential involvement with a median time between events of one year (range one week to 14 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarteritic-ischemic-optic-neuropathy-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In many series, the severity of the initial event appears to predict the severity of the subsequent event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarteritic-ischemic-optic-neuropathy-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/1,2,15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,15,18</a>], however one-third of patients will have a greater than six-line difference in visual acuities between affected eyes making an initial mild event not entirely reassuring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarteritic-ischemic-optic-neuropathy-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality and other vascular events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with NAION do not appear to have a higher mortality or risk for stroke or cardiovascular disease than would otherwise be expected on the basis of their underlying comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarteritic-ischemic-optic-neuropathy-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no known effective therapy for NAION to ameliorate the degree of visual impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarteritic-ischemic-optic-neuropathy-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/1,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Aspirin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> therapy does not appear to influence visual outcomes of acute NAION.

One retrospective study examined outcomes in 613 patients with NAION, 312 of whom were treated with corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarteritic-ischemic-optic-neuropathy-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Treated patients were somewhat younger and less likely to have hypertension or diabetes. After a median followup of 3.8 years, a benefit for treatment was observed in the subgroup of 70 eyes with initial acuity of <span class=\"nowrap\">20/70</span> or worse, who were treated within two weeks of onset; 70 percent improved two or more lines compared with 41 percent in the untreated group. In this subgroup, visual field defects were also more likely to improve in the treated compared with the untreated group (40 versus 25 percent). While the author concluded that early (within two weeks) treatment with corticosteroids leads to improvement in both visual acuity and visual fields, the findings from this nonblinded, nonrandomized study require prospective validation in a clinical trial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical therapies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Optic Nerve Sheath Decompression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In optic nerve sheath decompression surgery (ONDS), two or more slits or a window in the optic nerve sheath are created. This allows cerebrospinal fluid to escape, purportedly reducing the pressure surrounding the optic nerve. Compression of the optic nerve sheath is possibly pathogenic in NAION, and in initial reports, this appeared to be a promising strategy in reducing optic nerve damage in NAION [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarteritic-ischemic-optic-neuropathy-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The effectiveness of ONDS was evaluated in a single masked, multicenter, randomized clinical trial, the Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Decompression Trial (IONDT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarteritic-ischemic-optic-neuropathy-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Recruitment was halted early, two years after the study was initiated.</p><p>The initial report of the IONDT described six-month outcomes in 244 patients with NAION with age &gt;50 years and a baseline visual acuity worse than <span class=\"nowrap\">20/64</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarteritic-ischemic-optic-neuropathy-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Improved visual acuity by at least three lines occurred in 33 percent of the surgical group compared to 43 percent of controls. Visual acuity worsened by at least three lines in 24 percent of the surgical group compared with 12 percent of controls. These results indicate no benefit and possible harm from surgery. At 24 months, 31 and 29 percent of the surgery group and controls had improved vision, while 20 percent in the surgery and 22 percent in the control group had worsened visual acuity compared with baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarteritic-ischemic-optic-neuropathy-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Adverse effects of surgery included pain, diplopia, and central retinal artery occlusion.</p><p>The conclusions of IONDT were that ONDS appears to be of no value to most patients with NAION and could potentially cause further visual deterioration. An unexpectedly high rate of spontaneous improvement in visual acuity was observed in controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarteritic-ischemic-optic-neuropathy-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]; this was higher than previously reported.

Moreover, while serious complications were not reported in this series, surgical manipulation of the optic nerve head has the potential to further damage nerve fibers and blood vessels, potentially causing devastating loss of vision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarteritic-ischemic-optic-neuropathy-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Vitrectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A case series of 16 patients with NAION had findings on optical coherence tomography and ultrasound that were consistent with partial posterior vitreous detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonarteritic-ischemic-optic-neuropathy-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The authors postulated that elevation of the optic nerve head from traction of the posterior vitreous may have disrupted the microcirculation and axoplasmic flow leading to optic nerve edema and visual dysfunction. Surgical release of epipapillary vitreous traction via vitrectomy was performed within one month, with visual acuity improvement noted in 15 patients, nine of whom had greater than three lines of improvement.</p><p>This was an uncontrolled case series.
