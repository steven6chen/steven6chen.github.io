After a vasectomy, a man cannot get a woman pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1484561885\"><span class=\"h1\">How does a vasectomy prevent pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A vasectomy prevents pregnancy by blocking the path the sperm takes to leave the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69387\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69387 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Sperm are made in the testicles. The testicles are found inside a skin sac called the &quot;scrotum.&quot; Sperm are stored in the epididymis, which is a small organ that sits on top of the testicles. During ejaculation, sperm travel from the epididymis through tubes and out the end of the penis.</p><p>During a vasectomy, a doctor cuts and blocks a tube called the &quot;vas deferens.&quot; This prevents sperm from leaving the body. After a vasectomy, a man can still ejaculate fluid, called semen. But the semen does not have any sperm in it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1484561892\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might I choose to have a vasectomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might choose to have a vasectomy if you do not want any more children, and do not want to use birth control each time you have sex.</p><p>Let your doctor know if you have any questions or worries about having a vasectomy. He or she can talk with you and tell you about the procedure.</p><p>Some men choose to have a sample of their sperm saved before they have a vasectomy. If you want to have a sample of your sperm saved, talk with your doctor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1484561899\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during a vasectomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A vasectomy is done in a doctor's office and takes about 30 minutes. During the procedure, a doctor numbs the skin on the scrotum. Then he or she makes a small cut in the skin to reach the vas deferens, cut it, and seal it off. The procedure does not hurt, but some men can feel cramping or pulling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1484561906\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after a vasectomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can go home right after the procedure, but you will need to rest for 2 to 3 days. After a vasectomy, most men have some discomfort and bruising in the scrotum. Your doctor will tell you which pain-relieving medicines to take. He or she might also prescribe a medicine to treat your pain.</p><p>Your doctor will give you instructions about what you should and should not do after your vasectomy. He or she will probably tell you to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear a jock strap to hold the bandage in place</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not bathe or swim for 1 to 2 days</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not lift heavy objects or exercise too hard for 7 days</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wait 7 days to have sex. After that, you must use another form of birth control for a few months to prevent pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1484561913\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the side effects of a vasectomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Side effects are uncommon, but can occur. They can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe pain in the scrotum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding in the scrotum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection of the skin around the cut</p><p/><p>If you have any side effects, let your doctor know. Some side effects go away over time, but others might need treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1484561920\"><span class=\"h1\">How long does it take for a vasectomy to work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It takes a few months for a vasectomy to work. That's because the tubes can still have sperm in them.</p><p>A man needs to ejaculate 20 or more times after a vasectomy to clear out all the sperm from the tubes. Because of this, a couple should use another type of birth control for a few months to prevent pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1484561927\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I have a follow-up test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You will have a follow-up test called a &quot;sperm count&quot; to make sure that your semen does not have any sperm in it. Most men have this done 3 months after their vasectomy.</p><p>A sperm count checks how many sperm are in a sample of semen. For this test, a man needs to provide a sample of his semen.</p><p>If your sample has no sperm, you can stop using other birth control because you will not be able to get a woman pregnant. But if your sample has sperm in it, you can get a woman pregnant. You should still use birth control until you have another sperm count done.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1484561934\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I have had a vasectomy and want to father a child?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have had a vasectomy and want to father a child, talk with your doctor. A surgery to reconnect the vas deferens and open the sperm's path can be done. But this surgery does not always work.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1484561941\"><span class=\"h1\">Does a vasectomy prevent getting a disease from sex?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. A vasectomy does not prevent you from getting or spreading a disease from sex. To prevent getting or spreading a disease from sex, you should use a type of protection called a condom.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1484561948\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-birth-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Choosing birth control (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infertility-in-men-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Infertility in men (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasectomy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vasectomy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-acting-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Long-acting methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=permanent-sterilization-procedures-for-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Permanent sterilization procedures for women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=barrier-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Barrier methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
