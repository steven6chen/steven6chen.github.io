A loss of such functions can result from either disease (eg, chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis) or surgery (total pancreatectomy). The development of long-acting insulin and effective digestive enzymes have made it possible for patients to sustain a reasonable quality of life after a total pancreatectomy. </p><p>Total pancreatectomy has been performed since the 1970s, and its frequency has increased over the last two decades. The anatomy of the pancreas makes it difficult to remove. Along its length, the pancreas contacts almost all structures of the upper abdomen, and the head of the pancreas is densely adherent to the duodenum and envelops the distal common bile duct. As a result, a total pancreatectomy most often requires a concomitant duodenectomy, and subsequent gastric and biliary anastomoses to the jejunum to preserve gastrointestinal continuity. </p><p>The indications for and techniques of total pancreatectomy are discussed in this topic. Techniques of partial pancreatic resection are discussed in other topics.

In addition, a completion total pancreatectomy may be required to treat complications resulting from a prior partial pancreatic resection. </p><p>In a single center study of 136 patients, 82 percent had planned total pancreatectomy, 11 percent had conversion from pancreaticoduodenectomy, and 7 percent had completion total pancreatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The indications for planned pancreatectomies included adenocarcinoma (46 percent), chronic pancreatitis (18 percent), IPMN (12 percent), metastatic renal cell cancer (10 percent), and PNET (8 percent). This and other studies reported increasing numbers of total pancreatectomies being performed for hereditary pancreatitis and IPMNs, both strong risk factors for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2574072093\"><span class=\"h2\">Planned total pancreatectomy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1756707876\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic pancreatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total pancreatectomy is typically performed for patients with chronic pancreatitis to palliate unremitting pain, especially after they have developed diabetes. For those without diabetes, total pancreatectomy should, if possible, be performed with pancreatic islet autotransplantation. </p><p>Chronic pancreatitis is a morbid, debilitating condition often associated with chronic abdominal pain, narcotic addiction, multiple hospitalizations, and decreased quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients with chronic pancreatitis often develop diabetes or pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, and are 10 to 20 times more likely to develop pancreatic cancer than the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Chronic pancreatitis often leads to multiple diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, including surgery. Although chronic pancreatitis is an indication for total pancreatectomy, conventional endoscopic and surgical treatment options should be exhausted before attempting a total pancreatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chronic-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of chronic pancreatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgery-for-chronic-pancreatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgery for chronic pancreatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1888910823\"><span class=\"h3\">Hereditary pancreatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total pancreatectomy may be performed for patients with hereditary pancreatitis to improve quality of life and eliminate the risk of pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/1,2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6</a>]. In this patient population, early total pancreatectomy before the onset of diabetes is preferred so that islet autotransplantation can be performed. </p><p>Hereditary pancreatitis is a genetic disorder most commonly caused by mutations in autosomal genes such as protease, serine 1 (<em>PRSS1</em>), serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 (<em>SPINK 1</em>), and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<em>CFTR</em>). In adolescents and children with chronic pancreatitis, 50 to 70 percent have predisposing genetic mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Compared with chronic pancreatitis, hereditary pancreatitis has similar symptoms but earlier onset without any inciting factors. Patients with hereditary pancreatitis are 50 to 70 times more likely to develop pancreatic cancer than the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Because the entire pancreas is affected by the genetic mutation, endoscopic or surgical interventions other than total pancreatectomy are rarely successful in mitigating symptoms or preventing cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-pancreatitis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary pancreatitis&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Total pancreatectomy may be performed for tropical pancreatitis, which is also a condition with a possible genetic predisposition. Tropical pancreatitis is most commonly seen in southern India and sub-Saharan Africa, where it is the most common cause of chronic pancreatitis. Children are commonly affected, and often die in early adulthood from endocrine and exocrine dysfunction. Although the etiology is unknown, mutations in the serine protease inhibitor <em>SPINK1</em> gene have been identified in some patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Tropical pancreatitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172609449\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IPMN is a premalignant condition that can occur in either the main pancreatic duct or the branch ducts. Total pancreatectomy can be necessary to achieve a negative resection margin in patients with diffuse main duct or multifocal branch duct IPMNs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. </p><p>Main duct IPMNs have a greater malignant potential than branch duct IPMNs. In one study, malignancy was found in 62 and 26 percent of resected main-duct and branch-duct IPMNs, respectively, of which 43 and 18 percent contained invasive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

In two large retrospective studies, total and partial pancreatectomy resulted in similar 30-day perioperative mortality rates (approximately 5.5 percent) and long-term survival rates (approximately 22 percent). </p><p>Thus, total pancreatectomy should not be performed routinely as it obliges significant exocrine and endocrine replacement therapies without offering a survival benefit over a more limited pancreatic resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

The decision to perform a total pancreatectomy in this setting is usually made intraoperatively based upon the consistency of the pancreatic parenchyma and the caliber of the pancreatic duct (a soft pancreas with a small pancreatic duct is prone to developing fistula). </p><p>Additionally, a pancreaticoduodenectomy may also need to be converted to a total pancreatectomy when there is evidence of tumor extension beyond the neck of the pancreas, or when technical difficulty precludes a safe partial pancreatic resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The inferior border of the pancreas is identified to the left of the superior mesenteric vein and dissected from the retroperitoneum, taking care to preserve the inferior mesenteric vein if possible. The superior border of the pancreas is dissected to the left of the celiac axis, identifying the origin of the splenic and left gastric arteries. The duodenum and head of the pancreas are mobilized from the retroperitoneum anterior to the vena cava and the renal veins. Next, the superior mesenteric vein is identified and a tunnel created between it and the posterior surface of the pancreas. </p><p>Cephalad to the pancreas, the gastroduodenal artery is dissected, which exposes the portal vein and permits management of the hepatoduodenal ligament. The spleen is completely mobilized out of the retroperitoneum with the distal pancreas towards the confluence of the splenic, superior mesenteric, and portal veins. </p><p>If there are no contraindications to resection, the gastroduodenal artery is ligated and divided. The bile duct is divided and a cholecystectomy is performed. The stomach is transected pre- or postpyloric, and the proximal jejunum is transected distal to the ligament of Treitz. The splenic artery is ligated and divided, and the left gastric artery must be preserved as the only remaining blood supply to the stomach. The tail of the pancreas is then lifted anteriorly and the splenic vein ligated without tension to avoid narrowing the portal vein. The neck of the pancreas is dissected off the portal vein. The specimen is brought to the right so the uncinate process can be dissected off the superior mesenteric artery under direct vision. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H240845095\"><span class=\"h3\">Reconstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following resection of the pancreatic parenchyma and duodenum, reconstruction is required to restore gastrointestinal and biliary continuity. </p><p>The proximal jejunum is brought through a defect in the mesocolon and an anastomosis created between the bile duct and the jejunum. Approximately 30 to 40 cm distally, the jejunum is anastomosed to the stomach anterior to the colon. The distance between the two anastomoses helps to prevent bile gastritis. A decompressive tube gastrostomy may be placed in patients with severe diabetic gastroparesis, which is often exacerbated in the postoperative period.

In such patients, the Warshaw technique, which divides the splenic vein and artery but preserves short gastric vessels, may permit splenic preservation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The spleen should not be preserved in patients with known or suspected malignancy, or in those with confirmed high-grade dysplasia, because of the risk of lymphovascular invasion and the need to appropriately stage the disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Duodenum-preserving total pancreatectomy</strong> &ndash; Total pancreatectomy with preservation of the duodenum has been reported for benign indications such as chronic pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Although gastrointestinal continuity is not disrupted with this technique, a Roux-en-Y anastomosis is still required to drain the bile duct or any residual pancreatic tissue when necessary. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Minimally invasive total pancreatectomy</strong> &ndash; Although minimally invasive pancreatic surgery has been performed for over two decades, it is investigational. Open surgery remains the standard of care for patients who require a total pancreatectomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the published literature, there have been fewer than a dozen reported cases of laparoscopic or robotic total pancreatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/41-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-45</a>]. In the largest series, five robotic total pancreatectomies were performed without any mortality and only one major complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Only one of the five cases in that series, however, was for chronic pancreatitis, which is the most technically challenging indication for total pancreatectomy. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2478948983\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After surgery, patients are typically placed on an intravenous infusion of insulin to maintain a finger stick blood glucose (FSBG) level of &lt;180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. Patients can be started on a clear liquid diet on the first postoperative day if they have an appetite and the abdomen is soft, and their diet can be advanced as tolerated. Once a patient has tolerated a solid diet, they are transitioned from intravenous insulin to longer-acting insulin preparations, including sliding scale coverage for meals (see <a href=\"#H1066689297\" class=\"local\">'Endocrine replacement'</a> below). Additionally, pancreatic enzymes are started with solid foods. (See <a href=\"#H2077859571\" class=\"local\">'Exocrine replacement'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients are discharged when they are tolerating small meals, their pain is controlled with oral medications, they can ambulate independently, and they are capable of managing their blood glucose at home. Patients are encouraged to follow up with endocrinology shortly after discharge. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1066689297\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocrine replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insulin is the mainstay of endocrine replacement therapy after total pancreatectomy. Postsurgical patients should be treated in a manner similar to other patients with adult-onset type 1 diabetes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of blood glucose in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An intravenous insulin infusion is typically required for initial glycemic control during the immediate postoperative period because of inconsistent eating, malabsorption, stress hormone release, and lack of glucagon synthesis. Once a patient's diet becomes more reliable, insulin infusion can be replaced by longer-acting insulin preparations. Basal and prandial insulin doses should be adjusted to achieve euglycemia while avoiding potentially life-threatening hypoglycemia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2930218376\"><span class=\"h3\">After islet autotransplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective glucose control after islet transplantation depends upon the mass and quality of islets isolated from the resected pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In one study, more than 60 percent of patients who received greater than 5000 islet equivalents per kilogram of recipient body weight achieved insulin independence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In another study, low islet yield, alcoholic pancreatitis, and longer duration of pancreatitis (&gt;5 years) strongly predicted failure of islet autotransplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreas-and-islet-transplantation-in-diabetes-mellitus#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreas and islet transplantation in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Islet transplantation'</a>.)</p><p>By various reports, at one year after islet autotransplantation, 30 to 38 percent of patients were insulin independent, 38 to 49 percent required less than 20 units of insulin per day, and the rest were dependent upon a higher dose of insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. At five years, the percentage of patients who remained insulin-independent decreased to 27 percent. However, many patients continued to make c-peptide despite receiving exogenous insulin supplementation, suggesting continued graft function, which helps protect against &quot;brittle&quot; diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2077859571\"><span class=\"h2\">Exocrine replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After total pancreatectomy, patients should be given pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. Further tests are not required to establish malabsorption or malnutrition. </p><p>United States (US) patients should only use products that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), such as Creon, Zenpep, and Pancreaze, each of which contains <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancrelipase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pancrelipase</a>. Non-prescription products sold in the US can cause treatment failure because they have variable efficacy and contain primarily pancreatin prepared according to US pharmacopeial (USP) standards, which is 12 times less effective than pancrelipase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancrelipase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pancrelipase</a> delayed-release capsule (Creon) has been studied in patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>]. In one trial, six month of Creon therapy resulted in decreased stool frequency (one fewer per day), weight gain (approximately 3 kg), and improvements in abdominal pain, flatulence, and stool consistency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Although Zenpep and Pancreaze have not been studied in surgical patients, they contain the same ingredient as Creon, and therefore can be used with a unit-for-unit equivalency to Creon. </p><p>Pancreatic enzyme replacements should be given before all meals and snacks in doses commensurate with the fat content of the food. Patients should be started at an initial dose of 500 lipase <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> of body weight per meal, followed by titration based upon symptoms, up to a maximum of 2500 lipase <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> of body weight per meal or 10,000 lipase <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> of body weight per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-pancreatectomy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. For patients who remain symptomatic while taking the maximal doses of pancreatic enzyme, a proton-pump inhibitor or H2 blocker may be used to increase fat absorption, as the pancreatic enzyme preparations are pH-sensitive and designed to activate in the duodenum.

It is reserved for patients who have failed medical management and who are not candidates for less extensive surgery. Most total pancreatectomies are planned for benign (eg, chronic pancreatitis), premalignant (eg, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm), or malignant indications (eg, pancreatic cancer). A completion total pancreatectomy may be required as a rescue operation to treat severe complications (eg, uncontrolled sepsis, massive hemorrhage) of a prior, more limited pancreatic resection. (See <a href=\"#H1489673682\" class=\"local\">'Indications for total pancreatectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to a planned total pancreatectomy, patients should be screened for their ability to manage diabetes after surgery, undergo imaging studies to rule out metastatic disease, and receive vaccination for an anticipated splenectomy. (See <a href=\"#H488837069\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total pancreatectomy entails resection of the entire pancreatic parenchyma, most often with the duodenum and spleen, followed by gastrointestinal and biliary reconstruction. Resource-permitting, nondiabetic patients should receive islet autotransplantation. (See <a href=\"#H1749696439\" class=\"local\">'Standard technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediately after surgery, patients are typically managed with an intravenous infusion of insulin before being transitioned to longer acting insulin preparations. Patients should begin pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy when they resume a solid diet, using one of the regulated products such as Creon, Zenpep, and Pancreaze. (See <a href=\"#H2478948983\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The perioperative mortality and serious morbidity rates after total pancreatectomy are low. All patients develop diabetes postoperatively, and are predisposed to late diabetic complications or malnutrition. The overall functional and emotional quality of life is maintained in long-term survivors of total pancreatectomy.
