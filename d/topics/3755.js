It is also the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. In the United States, breast cancer is the most common female cancer, the second most common cause of cancer death in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Once a diagnosis of breast cancer is established, it is important to accurately define the initial extent of disease since this information will affect treatment recommendations. This topic will review the clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis, and staging following a diagnosis of breast cancer. </p><p>The factors that modify breast cancer risk, diagnostic evaluation of women with suspected breast cancer, the treatment approach to in situ and invasive breast cancer, and the use of prognostic and predictive factors when making adjuvant treatment decisions are reviewed as separate topics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365148828\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, including low and middle income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>]. The incidence rates are highest in North America, <span class=\"nowrap\">Australia/New</span> Zealand, and in western and northern Europe, and lowest in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These international differences are likely related to societal changes as a result of industrialization (eg, changes in fat intake, body weight, age at menarche, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lactation, and reproductive patterns such as fewer pregnancies and later age at first birth). Studies of migration patterns to the US are consistent with the importance of cultural <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> environmental changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In general, incidence rates of breast cancer are greater in second-generation migrants and increase further in third- and fourth- generation migrants. </p><p>In the United States, breast cancer accounts for approximately 266,000 cases each year and is responsible for over 40,000 deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The incidence rates decreased from 1999 to 2007 by 1.8 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is likely that two factors have contributed to this: the discontinuation of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the <span class=\"nowrap\">saturation/leveling</span> of screening mammography rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. Of these factors, the discontinuation of HRT has probably had a greater effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer/abstract/9,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,13</a>]. This was demonstrated in a report from the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative where a rapid decline in breast cancer incidence was noted in trial participants following discontinuation of HRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Discontinuation of HRT was not accompanied by changes in mammographic utilization, suggesting that the latter did not play a role in the decline in incidence rates.

In one of the largest reports, 516 consecutive patients seen at one institution for newly diagnosed breast cancer were retrospectively evaluated to determine the impact of staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Major findings were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bone scan detected bony metastases in 26 of 412 patients (6 percent).

However, it is a reasonable test to perform to further work-up suspicious or equivocal findings on CT or MRI and for women with locally advanced disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22756281\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessing the extent of disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mammographic assessment of the extent of DCIS and early invasive carcinoma begins during diagnostic mammography and continues through the biopsy, specimen management, and the postexcision mammogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Mammography of both breasts is particularly important in the patient with DCIS or invasive cancer who is considering breast conservation. Preoperative diagnostic mammography can help to define the extent of disease and may identify multifocal or multicentric cancer that could preclude breast conservation or signal a potential difficulty in achieving clear surgical margins. Multifocal disease is usually defined as involvement of several areas within a breast quadrant, probably representing disease along an entire duct. In contrast, multicentric disease involves multiple areas within different quadrants, probably representing involvement of multiple ducts.</p><p>Although the extent of mammographic nonlinear branching microcalcifications frequently underestimates the pathologic extent of the malignancy, the discrepancy is less than 2 cm in 80 to 85 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Several clusters of microcalcifications separated by normal appearing tissue should not be interpreted as multifocal or multicentric disease. Often, these represent areas of contiguous tumor that is only partially calcified within a ductal-lobule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>The combination of a mass and associated calcifications often indicates the presence of an extensive intraductal component (EIC). EIC is defined pathologically as DCIS found adjacent to an invasive carcinoma, accounting for more than 25 percent of the volume of disease. This finding can be a predictor for more widespread residual tumor (usually DCIS) following gross excision of the lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast ductal carcinoma in situ: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-conserving-therapy#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast conserving therapy&quot;, section on 'Extensive intraductal component (EIC)'</a>.)</p><p>Postoperative mammograms to look for residual calcifications after surgical resection should be considered when the microcalcifications are not clearly or completely documented on the specimen radiograph, or when margins are close or positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer/abstract/22,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,30,31</a>]. If a re-excision is to be recommended based on residual calcifications, care should be taken to ensure that the calcifications are associated with malignancy on histopathology and not benign tissue. Multifocal disease is not necessarily a contraindication to breast conservation, but is one of the factors that should be taken into consideration along with breast size relative to the extent of disease on imaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-conserving-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast conserving therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-ductal-carcinoma-in-situ-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast ductal carcinoma in situ: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>A significant limitation of mammographic assessment of disease extent is the obscuring of the borders or extent of the primary tumor by dense overlying tissue. Dense breasts can limit the sensitivity of mammography both for detection of breast cancers and for delineating disease extent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. In this setting, contrast-enhanced breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may complement mammographic staging. If the clinical extent of disease is larger than what can be appreciated by mammography, MRI may be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-women-with-suspected-breast-cancer#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of women with suspected breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Breast MRI'</a>.)</p><p>Mammographic assessment of tumor size for the staging of multifocal disease presents a unique dilemma. Most staging classifications require that the largest tumor mass be utilized for T staging, even in cases where multifocal disease is suspected. However, others suggest that the total surface area, volume, or aggregate measurements are a better indicator of prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. Accurate delineation of the extent of odd-shaped, irregular, or multifocal tumors is important for treatment planning.

Benign nodes can often be distinguished from metastatic or infiltrated intramammary lymph nodes by their mammographic or sonographic appearance, but definitive assessment often requires histopathologic study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The presence of intramammary lymph node metastases appears to confer a worse prognosis, both in women who otherwise have stage I breast cancer based upon tumor size and axillary nodal status and in those with stage II disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-newly-diagnosed-breast-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].
