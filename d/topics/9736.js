Nearly one-third of patients develop an incisional hernia after abdominal operations, and as many as 43 percent develop a recurrent hernia three years post-ventral incisional hernia repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-ventral-hernia-repair/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>The treatment of ventral hernias (primary and incisional) represents an underappreciated challenge for surgeons. Over 400,000 ventral hernia repairs are performed yearly in the United States at an estimated cost of over three billion dollars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-ventral-hernia-repair/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Contributors to increased costs include recurrent hernias, emergency repair, and new technology (eg, device costs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-ventral-hernia-repair/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, optimized perioperative decision making in patient selection, surgical technique, and choice of mesh have the potential to save millions of dollars in health care expenditures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-ventral-hernia-repair/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. </p><p>The classification, clinical features, and diagnosis of ventral hernias are discussed in another topic.

The process of choosing an approach and the techniques of open ventral hernia repair are discussed in another topic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-ventral-hernias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of ventral hernias&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since its introduction in the early 1990s, laparoscopic ventral hernia repair has gained popularity, although there are still significant controversies about the optimal technique.

The choice largely depends on surgeon training, expertise, and preference, except for the following.</p><p>Absolute contraindications to laparoscopic ventral hernia repair are the same as those to laparoscopy, including inability to tolerate pneumoperitoneum or inability to safely access the peritoneal cavity. The latter is typically due to a &quot;hostile abdomen,&quot; rendered by a history of extensive or multiple abdominal operations (especially with placement of intraperitoneal meshes), an open abdomen, or severe abdominal injuries, or by the presence of enterocutaneous fistulas. </p><p>Relative contraindications to laparoscopic ventral hernia repair are largely dependent on surgeon skill and resources but may include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large ventral hernias with a defect width &gt;8 to 10 cm or with greater than one-half of the abdominal viscera being outside of the boundary of the abdomen (ie, loss of domain) are difficult to repair without using advanced techniques such as component separation. An open approach is preferred unless the surgeon is facile with minimally invasive component separation techniques.

Intraperitoneal permanent mesh placement is generally not recommended in infected or contaminated fields, and intraperitoneal placement of biologic or bioabsorbable meshes may be associated with significantly increased rates of complications and recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-ventral-hernia-repair/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Thus, an open approach is preferred unless the surgeon can perform minimally invasive mesh explantation, component separation, and sublay placement of mesh. </p><p/><p>For the rest of this topic, it is assumed that the patient has been determined to be a suitable candidate for and offered laparoscopic repair. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4262544711\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The techniques described in this section reflect the authors' preference and should not be regarded as the only approach to laparoscopic ventral hernia repairs.

Patients should be secured to the bed with straps to allow the bed to be steeply tilted into reverse Trendelenburg or Trendelenburg positions when necessary, depending on the location of the hernia. A &quot;bump&quot; (wedge) placed under the site of planned trocar placement may facilitate lateral trocar placement, especially in smaller patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3102363646\"><span class=\"h2\">Tubes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A urinary catheter should be placed in patients with a history of urinary retention, when operative time is expected to exceed two to three hours, or when repairing a lower midline or suprapubic hernia. An orogastric tube should be placed to decompress the stomach if the peritoneal cavity is to be entered via the left upper quadrant; the stomach is often distended during preoxygenation and induction of general anesthesia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H951898641\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal entry and port placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The peritoneal cavity should be entered initially using a technique that the surgeon is most experienced with. We generally enter with a 5-mm trocar using the optical technique in the left upper quadrant, subcostal location, and lateral to the midclavicular line. However, there is no evidence that any specific technique is better than others in preventing entry-related major visceral or vascular complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-ventral-hernia-repair/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the reoperative abdomen, the initial entry should be performed away from any previous incisions and surgical field. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-access-techniques-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery#H651891356\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal access techniques used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Peritoneal access'</a>.)</p><p>For primary ventral hernia repair, one to two additional 5-mm trocars are placed in the left abdomen to facilitate safe adhesiolysis (if required) and to facilitate mesh fixation. For the complex, reoperative abdomen, more than two 5-mm trocars may be required. However, we avoid placing trocars larger than 5 mm laterally to minimize the risk of trocar site hernia. If larger trocars are necessary for mesh insertion, they should be placed through the hernia defect, which will eventually be covered by the mesh. (See <a href=\"#H2794234499\" class=\"local\">'Primary fascial closure (with video)'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2433234329\"><span class=\"h2\">Lysis of adhesion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most ventral incision hernia repairs, adhesiolysis is required to make room for subsequent mesh insertion, manipulation, and fixation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H908966438\"><span class=\"h2\">Preperitoneal dissection (with video)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When repairing hernias with incarcerated preperitoneal fat (typically primary ventral hernias such as umbilical and epigastric hernias), it is essential that all preperitoneal contents are reduced. Using the surgeon's choice of energy device, the peritoneum is incised circumferentially around the hernia fascial defect and the preperitoneal plane is entered. The preperitoneal fat is generally reduced en bloc with the associated hernia sac (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F116989\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef116989 \">movie 1</a>). With hernias that are at or above the level of the umbilicus, the falciform ligament should be taken down with the energy device to completely expose the fascial edges of the hernia and permit wide mesh apposition to the abdominal wall. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2794234499\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary fascial closure (with video)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, mesh reinforcement should be utilized in all patients undergoing elective laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. The fascial defect should be measured and mesh chosen to allow for at least 5 cm of overlap in all directions if the mesh is to be inserted in the underlay position. A 10- to 12-mm trocar is then placed through the fascial defect, through which the mesh is introduced. In general, we place four 0-polydioxanone sutures at the four corners prior to introducing the mesh into the peritoneal cavity. The sutures will serve as transfascial sutures. Alternatively, if the surgeon does not wish to use transfascial sutures, a single stay stitch can be placed in the center of the mesh to help position the mesh. If there are any pathologic specimens, such as excised chronically incarcerated preperitoneal fat or a hernia sac, they can be removed through the 10- to 12-mm <span class=\"nowrap\">trocar/fascial</span> defect at this time.</p><p>The fascia is then closed with 0-polydioxanone sutures using a transcutaneous suture passing device (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F116990\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef116990 \">movie 2</a>). Fascial defects are generally closed longitudinally, but for small defects, transverse closure may be appropriate. Depending on the location of the fascial defect as well as the skill of the surgeon, some fascial defects can also be closed intracorporeally using barbed sutures. Alternatively, a hybrid technique may be used in selected cases, where a small incision directly over the fascial defect permits hernia sac and content <span class=\"nowrap\">reduction/excision,</span> mesh introduction, and primary fascial closure; this is followed by laparoscopic mesh fixation.</p><p>The necessity of primary fascial closure during laparoscopic ventral hernia is debated; other surgeons do not routinely close the fascial defect. (See <a href=\"#H3036374468\" class=\"local\">'Primary fascial closure'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3754527901\"><span class=\"h2\">Mesh fixation (with video)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meshes can be fixated to the anterior abdominal wall with transfascial sutures, tacks, or a combination of the two. If no transfascial sutures are placed, two rows of permanent tacks should be used to fixate the mesh; if transfascial sutures are used, one or two rows of either absorbable or permanent tacks may be placed at the surgeon's discretion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To place transfascial sutures, multiple small &quot;stab&quot; incisions are made in the skin at locations that correspond to those of the previously placed sutures on the mesh. A transcutaneous laparoscopic suture passing device is advanced through the stab wound into the peritoneum. The assistant uses a laparoscopic grasper to feed each end of the sutures into the jaws of the awaiting suture passing device, which, when closed, brings the suture through the abdominal wall. For larger meshes, some surgeons place more transfascial sutures at 5-cm intervals in addition to those located at the four corners of the mesh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-ventral-hernia-repair/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Once all the sutures are brought through the abdominal wall, the peritoneal cavity is desufflated and the sutures are tied. The peritoneal cavity is then re-insufflated to a lower pressure (5 to 10 mmHg), and the mesh is examined laparoscopically to ensure appropriate coverage of fascial defect as well as appropriate apposition to the abdominal wall. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The mesh is then additionally fixated utilizing single or double rows (crowns) of absorbable or permanent tacks, per surgeon preference (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F116992\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef116992 \">movie 3</a>). The tacks are placed circumferentially at the margins of the mesh at 1-cm intervals, to prevent the bowel from becoming incarcerated between the mesh and the abdominal wall (single-crown technique). A second row of tacks may be placed at approximately 2-cm intervals and 2 cm from the hernia edge, to provide a more robust mesh fixation to the peritoneal surface (double-crown technique) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-ventral-hernia-repair/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If transfascial sutures are not utilized, the stay stitch on the mesh is generally brought through the abdominal wall at the center of the hernia fascial defect. A double crown of permanent tacks should then be utilized for mesh fixation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F116991\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef116991 \">movie 4</a>). Multiple mesh positioning devices are commercially available to hold the mesh in position while it is fixated (tacked). However, all of these devices have their limitations, including requirement for additional large port placement (which increases the risk of port site hernias), challenges in removing the devices, and cost. No studies have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes with the use of these devices. </p><p/><p>Mesh fixation methods are directly related to important patient outcomes such as postoperative pain and hernia recurrence. The optimal technique of mesh fixation is controversial; evidence for and against various mesh fixation methods are presented below. (See <a href=\"#H517118391\" class=\"local\">'Mesh fixation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3128644995\"><span class=\"h2\">Closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After mesh fixation, the operative field is examined for hemostasis and exclusion of any injury to underlying viscera. The peritoneal cavity is desufflated, trocars removed, and the skin incisions are closed per the surgeon's preference. In general, we do not place drains for laparoscopic ventral hernia repair.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3579465115\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative care/follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With enhanced recovery protocols, including multimodal pain regimens and regional anesthesia (eg, transversus abdominis plane block), the majority of patients can be discharged the same day following elective laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. It is important to counsel patients regarding how much pain is expected after surgery and strategies of managing pain. (See <a href=\"#H2361231430\" class=\"local\">'Premedication'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients should be seen in clinic within two to four weeks to evaluate for postoperative issues and complications. As an example, seromas and postoperative swelling may be encountered with larger hernias. Fevers and other signs of infection, including erythema <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> drainage at incisions, inability to tolerate oral intake, and worsening abdominal pain, should prompt immediate reevaluation. Early ambulation should be encouraged. Patients should not drive while taking narcotic pain medications. Return to work and activity restrictions should be individualized based on the level of postoperative pain.

However, the necessity of primary fascial closure in laparoscopic ventral hernia continues to be debated without any high-quality data to guide practice. Proponents of primary fascial closure argue that a central nonfunctional portion of the abdominal wall is prone to bulging, and that primary fascial closure restores normal anatomy and function of the abdominal wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-ventral-hernia-repair/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Although these two techniques have been compared in multiple studies (including randomized trials), data do not conclusively show one technique to be superior to the other. In a 2018 systematic review and meta-analysis of three trials that directly compared the two techniques, suture fixation was associated with a lower recurrence rate, but the difference was not statistically significant (recurrence rate 7.2 versus 1.7 percent; RR 3.07, 95% CI 0.71-13.33) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-ventral-hernia-repair/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

In general, fixation to bony or ligamentous structures such as the pubic symphysis, Cooper's ligament, ribs, and iliac crest is stronger than fixation to anterior abdominal wall muscles, which is in turn stronger than fixation to posterior abdominal wall muscles.

Other fixation methods were associated with intermediate recurrence rates of 6 percent (with permanent tacks plus sutures), 7.7 percent (with permanent sutures only), 0.7 percent (with absorbable tacks plus sutures; this group had fewer patients and a shorter follow-up than the others). </p><p>Mesh fixation methods and their contributions to hernia recurrence have been discussed in detail above. (See <a href=\"#H517118391\" class=\"local\">'Mesh fixation'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2572604057\"><span class=\"h2\">Mesh bulging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not every bulge in the area of a previous ventral hernia repair is a recurrent hernia. In some patients, mesh that remains anchored to the abdominal wall peripherally can protrude centrally through the hernia opening into the hernia sac to cause bulging. Such cases of mesh bulging (also referred to as eventration) cannot be distinguished from true hernia recurrences very easily without imaging. Mesh bulging is observed in 1.6 to 17.4 percent of patients, mostly after undergoing laparoscopic repair of large ventral hernias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-ventral-hernia-repair/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. </p><p>Bulging can be caused by expansion of the mesh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-ventral-hernia-repair/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>] or narrowing of the hernia defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-ventral-hernia-repair/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Because bridging of the hernia defect as performed with the standard <span class=\"nowrap\">underlay/intraperitoneal</span> onlay (IPOM) technique does not fully restore the abdominal wall function, it can cause more frequent recurrence and bulging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-ventral-hernia-repair/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. For that reason, primary fascial closure has been suggested to reduce the risk of mesh bulging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-ventral-hernia-repair/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3036374468\" class=\"local\">'Primary fascial closure'</a> above.)</p><p>For symptomatic patients, treatment can be reapproximating the fascia alone or a new mesh repair (ie, old mesh explantation, fascial closure, placement of new mesh). In asymptomatic patients, &quot;watchful waiting&quot; is a reasonable option. Once &quot;bulging&quot; occurs, it neither has the tendency for further enlargement nor seems to lead to the development of recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-ventral-hernia-repair/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2088491898\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most, but not all, ventral hernias can be repaired both open and laparoscopically. The choice largely depends on surgeon training, expertise, and preference, except that (see <a href=\"#H3453267911\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative preparation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Absolute contraindications to laparoscopic ventral hernia repair include inability to tolerate pneumoperitoneum and inability to safely access the peritoneal cavity (typically due to a &quot;hostile abdomen&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Relative contraindications to laparoscopic ventral hernia repair are dependent on surgeon skill and resources and may include very large hernia defects (width &gt;8 to 10 cm or loss of domain), hernias with associated acute bowel obstruction or perforation, and infected meshes or associated complications (eg, enteric fistulas). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, mesh reinforcement should be used in all patients undergoing elective laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. The fascial defect should be measured and mesh chosen to allow for at least 5 cm of overlap in all directions if the mesh is to be inserted in the underlay position. (See <a href=\"#H2794234499\" class=\"local\">'Primary fascial closure (with video)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the benefit of primary fascial closure remains unproven, we generally perform primary facial closure for hernia defects &gt;3 cm in width; bridged repair is acceptable for smaller defects, particularly primary ventral hernias. (See <a href=\"#H2794234499\" class=\"local\">'Primary fascial closure (with video)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3036374468\" class=\"local\">'Primary fascial closure'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple acceptable methods for mesh fixation exist, including with transfascial sutures only, with transfascial sutures plus one or two crowns (rows) of tacks, or with tacks only. When transfascial sutures are omitted, we suggest mesh fixation with a double crown of permanent, rather than absorbable, tacks (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3754527901\" class=\"local\">'Mesh fixation (with video)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H517118391\" class=\"local\">'Mesh fixation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripherally located ventral hernias pose unique challenges to mesh fixation; wide dissection and exposure along with wide mesh overlap may help overcome the barriers for circumferential fixation at these locations. Fixation with tacks to the diaphragm should be avoided as it has been associated with serious complications such as lung and cardiac injuries (tamponade). Fixation above the costal margin should not be accomplished with sutures placed between ribs either, which may injure neurovascular bundles running along the inferior surface of each rib or cause a pneumothorax. (See <a href=\"#H4091329898\" class=\"local\">'Fixation locations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are multiple options for mesh location in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, including intraperitoneal (underlay) placement, preperitoneal placement, and <span class=\"nowrap\">retromuscular/retrorectus</span> (sublay) placement. There are no high-quality studies that favor any one technique. Intraperitoneal (underlay) mesh placement is most commonly performed in laparoscopic repair. (See <a href=\"#H2966302133\" class=\"local\">'Mesh location'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of meshes, both synthetic and biologic, are available commercially for laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. In elective cases, studies suggest synthetic medium-weight mesh to be associated with the best outcomes; light or ultra-lightweight synthetic meshes should not be used in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair due to a higher failure rate. (See <a href=\"#H1328636621\" class=\"local\">'Mesh type (synthetic, biologic, and bioabsorbable)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, intraperitoneal placement of synthetic meshes following a repaired enterotomy should be avoided because of a high risk of mesh infection. The role for biologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bioabsorbable meshes in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair is unknown. (See <a href=\"#H1328636621\" class=\"local\">'Mesh type (synthetic, biologic, and bioabsorbable)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3673658598\" class=\"local\">'Enterotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of robotic ventral hernia repair techniques is growing. Although available evidence based on retrospective studies suggests robotic repair does not improve outcomes but increases costs compared with conventional laparoscopic techniques, robotic retromuscular repair may be associated with decreased hospital stay when compared with the equivalent open technique. (See <a href=\"#H1883978971\" class=\"local\">'Robotic ventral hernia repair'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laparoscopic-ventral-hernia-repair/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Poulose BK, Shelton J, Phillips S, et al.
