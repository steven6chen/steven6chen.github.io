PTSD is seen in some children (and not others) after exposure to traumatic experiences involving actual or threatened injury to themselves or others. </p><p>PTSD is characterized by intrusive thoughts and reminders of the traumatic experience(s), avoidance of trauma reminders, negative mood and cognitions related to the traumatic experience(s), and physiological hyperarousal that lead to significant social, school, and interpersonal problems. PTSD can occur even in toddlers (one to two years old) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>This topic will address pharmacotherapy for PTSD in children.
