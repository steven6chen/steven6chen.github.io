Strokes can happen when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An artery going to the brain gets clogged or closes off, and part of the brain goes without blood for too long</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An artery breaks open and starts bleeding into or around the brain</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23723363\"><span class=\"h1\">How do strokes affect people?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effects of a stroke depend on a lot of things, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which part and how much of the brain is affected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How quickly the stroke is treated</p><p/><p>Some people who have a stroke have no lasting effects. Others lose important brain functions. For example, some people become partly paralyzed or unable to speak. Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the world.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23723370\"><span class=\"h1\">How can you tell if someone is having a stroke?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is an easy way to remember the signs of a stroke. Just think of the word &quot;FAST&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73487\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73487 \">figure 1</a>). Each letter in the word stands for one of the things you should watch for:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>F</strong>ace &ndash; Does the person's face look uneven or droop on one side?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>A</strong>rm &ndash; Does the person have weakness or numbness in one or both arms? Does one arm drift down if the person tries to hold both arms out?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>S</strong>peech &ndash; Is the person having trouble speaking? Does his or her speech sound strange?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>T</strong>ime &ndash; If you notice <strong>any</strong> of these stroke signs, <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>. You need to act FAST. The sooner treatment begins, the better the chances of recovery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23723377\"><span class=\"h1\">How are strokes treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The right treatment depends on what kind of stroke you are having. You need to get to the hospital <strong>very quickly</strong> to figure this out.</p><p>People whose strokes are caused by clogged arteries can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get treatments that help reopen clogged arteries. These treatments can help you recover from the stroke.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get medicines that prevent new blood clots. These medicines also help prevent future strokes.</p><p/><p>People whose strokes are caused by bleeding can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have treatments that might reduce the damage caused by bleeding in or around the brain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop taking medicines that increase bleeding, or take a lower dose</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have surgery to repair the artery or stop the bleeding (this is not always possible to do)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23723384\"><span class=\"h1\">Can strokes be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many strokes can be prevented, though not all. You can greatly lower your chance of having a stroke by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking your medicines exactly as directed. Medicines that are especially important in preventing strokes include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blood pressure medicines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines called statins, which lower cholesterol</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines to prevent blood clots, such <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> or blood thinners</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines that help to keep your blood sugar as close to normal as possible (if you have diabetes)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Making lifestyle changes:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stop smoking, if you smoke</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Get regular exercise (if your doctor says it's safe) for at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lose weight, if you are overweight</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, and low in meats, sweets, and refined grains (such as white bread or white rice)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Eat less salt (sodium)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Limit the amount of alcohol you drink</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>If you are a woman, do not drink more than 1 drink a day</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>If you are a man, do not drink more than 2 drinks a day</p><p/><p>Another way to prevent strokes is to have surgery to reopen clogged arteries in the neck. This surgery is appropriate for only a small group of people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23723391\"><span class=\"h1\">What is a &quot;TIA&quot;?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A TIA is like a stroke, but it does not damage the brain. TIAs happen when an artery in the brain gets clogged or closes off and then reopens on its own. This can happen if a blood clot forms and then moves away or dissolves. TIA stands for &quot;transient ischemic attack.&quot;</p><p>Even though TIAs do not cause lasting symptoms, they are serious. If you have a TIA, you are at high risk of having a stroke. It's important that you see a doctor and take steps to prevent that from happening. Do not ignore the symptoms of a stroke even if they go away!</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23723482\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=transient-ischemic-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Transient ischemic attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lowering-the-risk-of-having-another-stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lowering the risk of having another stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-after-an-ischemic-stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines after an ischemic stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=recovery-after-stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Recovery after stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhagic-stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hemorrhagic stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High cholesterol (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-can-go-wrong-after-a-heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What can go wrong after a heart attack?
