Over 50 percent of affected children are born at term (&ge;37 weeks of gestation), 25 to 40 percent at &lt;32 weeks, and the remainder between 32 and 36+6 weeks. </p><p>In population-based studies, risk factors for delivery of a neurologically impaired child include maternal infection, placental infection (acute chorioamnionitis), intrauterine growth restriction, and a family history of CP or related neurologic disorders. Immaturity and malformations of the central nervous system (CNS) are common causes of neurologic impairment among children delivered preterm. By comparison, few neurologically impaired children born at term have a clearly identifiable etiologic factor. Causes include perinatal stroke, an inborn error of metabolism (eg, mitochondrial disorders), CNS infection, congenital hypothyroidism, and exposure to an exogenous (eg, mercury) or endogenous (eg, bilirubin) toxin.</p><p>The contribution of intrapartum hypoxia to CNS injury in term infants is controversial. In the United States and other developed countries the large number of medical liability claims against physicians who delivered neurologically impaired children has led to a crisis that threatens the availability of obstetrical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Epidemiologic studies suggest that intrapartum hypoxia is a direct cause of only about 9 percent of cases of CP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Other evidence suggests that most CNS injury occurs in the intrapartum period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics have proposed essential criteria needed to define that an acute intrapartum event was sufficient to cause cerebral palsy, as well as the collective criteria that suggest intrapartum timing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F96192\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96192 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Placental pathology can identify clinically silent, pathophysiologic processes that can directly cause CNS damage, decrease the threshold for neurological injury, or serve as markers for a deleterious in utero environment. Placental lesions associated with neurodisability have been found in the placentas of infants at all birth weights and gestational ages, but are most helpful for understanding unanticipated poor outcomes in term infants. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETERM PLACENTAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central nervous system (CNS) damage related to immaturity of the developing brain and cardiopulmonary system is the major cause of CP and other long-term neurologic deficits in very low birth weight (VLBW, &lt;1.5 kg) and extremely low birth weight (ELBW, &lt;1.0 kg) infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. While placental lesions may modulate the risk, they are usually not the sole factor causing brain injury in these infants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-etiology-and-prevention-of-cerebral-palsy#H16406295\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, etiology, and prevention of cerebral palsy&quot;, section on 'Prematurity'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical chorioamnionitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A meta-analysis analyzing chorioamnionitis as a risk factor for CP found a significant association between clinical chorioamnionitis and CP in premature infants (RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4-2.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The relationship between histological chorioamnionitis (HCA) to this outcome was not statistically significant (RR 1.6, 95% CI 0.9-2.7).</p><p>Paradoxically, a few reports have found that placentas with HCA are associated with improved survival and better short-term outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. This may be due, in part, to the powerful deleterious effects of other pathologic lesions associated with preterm birth, such as severe maternal vascular disease and villous edema (see below). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-placental-pathology-report#H87576253\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The placental pathology report&quot;, section on 'Chorioamnionitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4112530923\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute fetal inflammatory response (FIR)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There appears to be a significant association between acute FIR (which commonly accompanies HCA in preterm placentas) and sonographically-defined white matter lesions in VLBW and ELBW newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The association between acute FIR and development of CP-related neurological processes in older children is less clear. In one study of VLBW infants, there was a weak association between HCA and development of CP-related forms of neurologic impairment when HCA was accompanied by high grade acute FIR or acute FIR with chorionic vessel thrombi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Another study of ELBW infants failed to find any association of HCA or acute FIR with either CP or abnormal neurocognitive testing in the group as a whole, but did find that high grade acute FIR predicted lower neurocognitive test scores in the subgroup with HCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The association between acute fetal vasculitis and CNS lesions supports the hypothesis that increased circulating cytokines may damage immature oligodendroglia in the developing CNS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. This theory is supported by studies showing that cytokine levels are higher when FIR affects the umbilical artery or arteries, as opposed to the umbilical vein <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chorionic plate vessels alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

Large studies have also demonstrated an increased prevalence of CP and other neurodevelopmental disorders in small for gestational age infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>] and low birth weight infants. A study of ELBW infants found that placental lesions (increased syncytial knots, multiple villous infarcts, decidual arteriopathy [acute atherosis]) associated with maternal vascular disease were strongly associated with CP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A previous study in VLBW infants had suggested a biphasic relationship, with less severe lesions correlating with better outcomes and more severe lesions correlating with worse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>In addition, a population-based study of placental infarcts identified by gross inspection of the placenta in singleton pregnancies &gt;35 weeks gestational age found a two-fold increase in CP and an eight-fold increase in CP with spastic quadriplegia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Although lack of histologic confirmation is a limitation of this study, it suggests that placental infarction should be separated from other signs of maternal vascular malperfusion in all future studies of the placenta and neurodisability.

Subsequent studies have shown that this lesion is also associated with an increased risk of neonatal death, CP, and chronic lung disease in VLBW infants, and lower neurocognitive scores at school age in ELBW infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/18,25,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,25,32,33</a>]. In one of these studies, placental lesions associated with maternal vascular malperfusion were risk factors for CP, while villous edema was associated with neurocognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. HCA was not predictive of outcome in the population as a whole, but a severe FIR was associated with neurocognitive impairment in the subpopulation with HCA. Placentas with increased syncytial knots, villous edema, and those with neither finding comprised nonoverlapping subgroups with distinct pathologic and perinatal characteristics: Among infants with villous edema, those with neurologic impairment had lower gestational ages and more severe degrees of HCA. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiple placental lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premature infants have a dramatically enhanced risk of neurodisability when the placenta has more than one lesion associated with adverse outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. These lesions include all of the aforementioned lesions, plus longstanding chorioamnionitis with amnion necrosis (necrotizing chorioamnionitis), retroplacental hematomas with intraplacental extension (findings consistent with abruption placenta), and increased circulating nucleated red blood cells (see below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TERM PLACENTAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Underlying clinical risk factors explaining CNS injury in term infants are less well-defined than in premature infants. Placental pathology can identify processes that directly contribute to neurologic impairment, and can also identify placentas with decreased functional reserve and adaptive changes indicative of an abnormal intrauterine environment. Many cases of CP at term are preceded by neonatal encephalopathy and accompanied by basal ganglia injury, which may be related, at least in part, to acute and chronic inflammatory placental lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute processes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Processes associated with fetal hypoxia occurring less than four to six hours prior to delivery are generally only detectable by pathologic examination of the placenta if they result in disruption and deformation of placental tissues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Abruptio placentae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, the diagnosis of abruptio placentae is made clinically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placental-abruption-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placental abruption: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) However, direct visualization of a large central retroplacental blood clot with indentation of the placenta or rupture of the basal plate at the time of cesarean delivery is strong evidence of abruptio placentae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60258\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60258 \">picture 1</a>). Sonographic diagnosis, clinical signs and symptoms, and histological findings (diffuse retromembranous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intradecidual hemorrhages, irregular basal intervillous thrombi, and recent villous stromal hemorrhage) are less specific for the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

A rare type of catastrophic fetal hemorrhage involves subamnionic and umbilical cord hematomas caused by extreme stretching of an entangled umbilical cord during fetal descent through the birth canal. All of these types of fetal hemorrhage occur quite commonly during the course of delivery of the infant, therefore, evidence of spread of hemorrhage into adjacent tissues and blood loss in the neonate are necessary before imparting significance to any of these placental findings.

This concept has been utilized by neurologists and neuroradiologists to describe specific patterns of brain injury related to sustained or repetitive periods of significant hypoxia or other systemic stress affecting the fetus over a period of many hours to days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">HCA and severe acute FIR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A meta-analysis evaluating the association between histologic chorioamnionitis (HCA) and CP in term and late preterm infants found that clinical signs of HCA were a significant risk factor for CP in these infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, HCA is a common placental lesion, affecting between 10 to 15 percent of placentas delivered at term, while CP is rare. A few studies have evaluated subtypes of HCA that might be stronger risk factors for development of brain injury. High grade acute FIR, defined by confluent neutrophilic infiltration of chorionic or umbilical vessel walls plus disorganization of vascular smooth muscle fibers and endothelial activation, has been identified as a highly significant risk factor for CP and related forms of neurodisability. All other grades and stages of HCA studied were equally prevalent in the placentas of term infants with and without neurologic impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/placental-pathology-in-cases-of-neurologically-impaired-infants/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].

This lesion has been associated with prolonged meconium exposure, and may develop due to toxic effects of bile acids and other constituents of meconium.
