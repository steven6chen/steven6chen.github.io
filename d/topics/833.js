Trauma to the anoderm with the passage of a hard stool is thought to be a common initiating factor. Persistence of a fissure is typically associated with anal spasm or high anal pressure. The treatment of anal fissure breaks the cyclic anal sphincter spasm, prevents tearing of the anal mucosa, and promotes healing of the fissure. </p><p>The majority of anal fissures are treated medically, which is the topic of this discussion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-medical-management/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Surgical therapy, which is reserved for refractory anal fissures, is discussed in another topic. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prevention of anal fissure are also discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anal-fissure-surgical-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anal fissure: Surgical management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anal-fissure-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anal fissure: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4056176745\"><span class=\"h1\">ATYPICAL FISSURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anal fissures can be primary or secondary. Most typical fissures are primary and are caused by local trauma in the context of anal spasm or high anal pressure. Primary anal fissures are most commonly located at the posterior midline, and less commonly at the anterior midline. Secondary, or atypical, anal fissures are caused by another disease process such as Crohn disease and can occur at locations other than the midline. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anal-fissure-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-prevention#H20606158\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anal fissure: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prevention&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>Thus, finding of an anal fissure that is not at the midline should prompt an evaluation for Crohn disease, although Crohn-related fissures can also occur at the midline. Other manifestations of perianal Crohn disease include the presence of multiple, recurring, or nonhealing fissures; unusually deep or wide fissures; painless fissures; and perianal skin tags that are hypertrophic, edematous, and tender. Patients with suspected Crohn-related fissures should be referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perianal-complications-of-crohn-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perianal complications of Crohn disease&quot;, section on 'Anal fissures'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H72479757\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL MANAGEMENT OF TYPICAL FISSURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with a typical anal fissure (ie, a single posterior or anterior fissure with no evidence of Crohn disease), we recommend prescribing a combination of supportive measures (fiber, sitz bath, topical analgesic) and one of the topical vasodilators (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>) for one month (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82392\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef82392 \">algorithm 1</a>). In addition, patients who are constipated should receive a stool softener or laxative. The treatment goal is to relax the internal anal sphincter, initiate and maintain atraumatic passage of stool, and relieve pain.</p><p>Although medical therapy is less effective than surgery, especially for chronic anal fissures, it should be offered first because of its wide availability, better tolerance, and lack of severe complications (ie, fecal incontinence) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-medical-management/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The best data come from a trial that randomly assigned 54 patients with anal fissures to receive either a lateral internal sphincterotomy (surgery) or 0.2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> ointment (medical therapy) for 10 weeks; all patients received warm sitz baths and a fiber-bulking agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-medical-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Compared with the medicine group, the surgery group achieved higher rates of fissure healing (96 versus 67 percent at 5 weeks and 100 versus 89 percent at 10 weeks) at the expense of a significantly higher rate of minor fecal incontinence (44 versus 0 percent). Fifteen percent of patients who underwent surgery had residual fecal incontinence after two years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3548714\"><span class=\"h2\">Fiber</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fiber therapy prevents hard bowel movements, which could reinjure a healing fissure.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing dietary fiber and water intake is the best way to soften and bulk the stool. The recommended dietary fiber intake is between 20 and 35 grams per day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52349\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52349 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who continue to have difficulty with hard bowel movements despite increasing dietary fiber intake may use fiber supplements, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">psyllium</a> seed (Metamucil), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylcellulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylcellulose</a> (Citrucel), wheat dextran (Benefiber), and calcium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polycarbophil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polycarbophil</a> (Fibercon). These over-the-counter products work by absorbing water and increasing stool bulk, which increases the frequency of bowel movements and softens stool. Fiber supplements are safe for daily use, non-habit-forming, and can be used lifelong. Possible side effects may include gas and bloating, especially when they are first started. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Constipation in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3548834\"><span class=\"h2\">Sitz bath</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Warm sitz baths, which can relax the anal sphincter and improve blood flow to the anal mucosa, are recommended for patients with anal fissures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-medical-management/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. During a sitz bath, the anus is immersed in warm water for approximately 10 to 15 minutes two to three times daily. Sitz bath kits are available in most drugstores, and portable bowls can be used at work or school. At home, it is also possible to use a bathtub for sitz bath by filling it with two to three inches of warm water. Additives such as soap and bubble bath are not recommended. After a sitz bath, it is important to towel or blow dry (with a hair dryer on low heat setting) the anal area well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3548879\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical analgesics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although topical analgesic jelly or creams (eg, 2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> jelly) are often prescribed for patients with an anal fissure for pain control, their use <strong>alone</strong> has not been shown to be more effective than other supportive measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-medical-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, some prescribers add a topical analgesic to a topical vasodilator for patient comfort when the topical vasodilator is custom made by a compounding pharmacy. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> ointment can be made with or without topical lidocaine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H557732448\"><span class=\"h2\">Stool softener or laxative</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docusate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docusate</a>) and natural products are available for treating constipation either over-the-counter or by prescription. Constipation may lead to straining, which can exacerbate the anal fissure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H72479771\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical vasodilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aside from supportive measures, patients with anal fissures are also prescribed one of two topical vasodilators: topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> or topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>. We recommend using 0.2 to 0.3% nifedipine ointment two to four times daily in patients who have access to a compounding pharmacy because nifedipine ointment has fewer side effects and potential drug interactions compared with nitroglycerin. For patients who do not have access to a compounding pharmacy, we recommend using 0.4% nitroglycerin rectal ointment (Rectiv) twice daily, as it is commercially available. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3548935\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical nifedipine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nifedipine</a> can be compounded into a gel form and applied on or around the fissure in the anal canal to reduce the anal sphincter pressure. Topical nifedipine is typically used two to four times daily as a 0.2 to 0.3% ointment. </p><p>In a trial of 52 patients with chronic anal fissures, treatment with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a> resulted in more healing (89 versus 58 percent) and fewer side effects (5 versus 40 percent) compared with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-medical-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Recurrence rates at 124 to 183 weeks were comparable between the two groups (42 versus 31 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H72479779\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical nitroglycerin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> promotes the healing of anal fissure by increasing local blood flow and reducing pressure in the internal anal sphincter. The observation that the posterior commissure of the internal sphincter is less perfused than the other sections led to the concept that ischemia could be contributing to the persistence of anal fissures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-medical-management/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> is typically applied rectally as a 0.2 or 0.4% ointment twice daily for eight weeks. A 0.4% nitroglycerin ointment (Rectiv) is commercially available. Alternatively, a lower dose of 0.2% nitroglycerin ointment can be custom made by a pharmacist.</p><p>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> is an effective treatment for anal fissures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-medical-management/abstract/12-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-19</a>]. A meta-analysis found topical nitroglycerin to be superior to placebo in healing anal fissures (49 verus 36 percent), but 50 percent of patients successfully treated with topical nitroglycerin developed recurrent fissures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-medical-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The major side effects of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> are headaches and hypotension. Headaches generally occur 10 to 15 minutes after application and last no more than 30 minutes in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anal-fissure-medical-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Headaches occur most commonly during the initial two weeks of therapy and decrease thereafter.</p><p>Hypotension can cause dizziness. Thus, patients should sit or lie down when applying the ointment and should stand up slowly afterwards. To avoid serious drug interactions, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> should not be used within 24 hours of taking medications for erectile dysfunction, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a> (Viagra), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tadalafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tadalafil</a> (Cialis), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vardenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vardenafil</a> (Levitra).
