This malignancy was relatively rare until the early 1980s when, with the onset of the HIV epidemic, it was described in several homosexual men in North America. The epidemiology of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) suggested a link between the development of disease and a transmissible agent. In 1994, a novel gamma herpesvirus was identified in KS biopsies. After sequence analysis of the genome and characterization of the viral replication cycle, this virus was subsequently named human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) or Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HHV-8 fits most closely into the family of human gamma herpesviruses, which includes Epstein-Barr virus. Gamma herpesviruses play an important role in cellular proliferation and the development of malignancies. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Virology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HHV-8 infects a wide variety of cell types, including B cells, endothelial cells, macrophages, and epithelial cells. This broad cellular tropism may be due to the interaction between HHV-8 and a ubiquitous host cell-surface molecule. The envelope glycoproteins B (gB) and K8.1 of HHV-8 bind to cellular targets to initiate adhesion, while gH and gL facilitate entry. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Viral entry into host cells'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of putative cellular receptors for HHV-8 have been defined, including various integrins, DC-SIGN, and the transmembrane light chain of the human <span class=\"nowrap\">cystine/glutamate</span> exchange transporter system x-c (xCT). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Viral entry into host cells'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As with all herpesviruses, the HHV-8 replication cycle includes both latent and lytic phases. In studies of transformed cell lines, latent virus can be &quot;induced&quot; to upregulate viral replication and expression. In the lytic phase, the virus produces a wide range of structural and replicative gene products that lead to the production of intact virions. Factors which govern entry into lytic replication are beginning to be defined. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Lytic replication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical observations suggest that T-cells play an important role in the control of KS, as evidenced by the increased incidence of KS among transplant recipients and AIDS patients, the regression of KS with the reduction of immunosuppressive treatment following transplant, and clinical improvement of KS in subjects with immune reconstitution following antiretroviral therapy. Additional evidence also supports a role for natural killer (NK) cells and neutralizing antibodies in control of KS. (See <a href=\"#H458573284\" class=\"local\">'Host immune response and control of HHV-8 infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HHV-8 has evolved a number of mechanisms by which it may subvert the host immune system. These factors may help explain why the virus is persistent and widespread in many populations. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Evasion of the host immune response'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HHV-8 seroprevalence is relatively high in certain regions, such as Sardinia and Africa, compared with North America and northern Europe, where seroprevalence is low. Besides having different prevalence rates in different geographic regions, the specific risk groups for seropositivity appear to vary depending upon the location. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The exact mode(s) of transmission for HHV-8 remains unclear. The search for clues derives from seroepidemiologic studies and from investigations to localize the body sites that harbor the virus. Saliva appears to be a source of infectious virus. It has been proposed that saliva may be the main mode of HHV-8 transmission in children and that it could be a source of mother-to-child transmission. Other possible modes of transmission include sexual transmission, blood transfusions, and solid organ transplantation.
