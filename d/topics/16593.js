But if these treatments do not work well, or you don't want to try them, you might have surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1827030014\"><span class=\"h1\">How do doctors do surgery to treat stress urinary incontinence in women?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most surgery to treat stress urinary incontinence in women is &quot;minimally invasive&quot; surgery. This means the doctor makes smaller cuts than in regular surgery and uses small tools that he or she controls from the outside. But doctors can also do &quot;open&quot; surgery. This means they make a cut big enough to work on the body directly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1827030031\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there different types of surgery to treat stress urinary incontinence?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are many types. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;sling procedure&quot; &ndash; A sling is a small piece of material that goes around the urethra. (The urethra is the tube that carries urine out of the body.) There are different types of slings, but they all give the urethra support to help keep it from leaking urine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F85868\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85868 \">figure 1</a>). The sling can be made of artificial mesh or tissue from the woman's body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure called the &quot;Burch procedure&quot; or &quot;retropubic colposuspension&quot; &ndash; In this procedure, a doctor attaches the tissue around the urethra to strong bands of tissue inside the belly. This procedure can be &quot;minimally invasive&quot; surgery (several small cuts) or &quot;open&quot; surgery (one large cut).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An injection (shot) of material next to the urethra &ndash; The material makes the area around the urethra thicker. This helps support the urethra and keep urine from leaking out. This treatment is mostly for women who still have stress incontinence after they have already had surgery. It is usually done in a doctor's office.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1827030094\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the benefits of surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main benefit is that surgery can often fix stress incontinence when other treatments do not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1827030111\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the risks of surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risks of surgery are different depending on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What type of surgery you have</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your age and overall health</p><p/><p>The risks of surgery include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems from surgery, such as bleeding, infection, or a tear in the bladder</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble getting all the urine out when urinating</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress incontinence after surgery &ndash; Some women might still have stress incontinence after surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urgency incontinence, also called &quot;urge incontinence&quot; or &quot;overactive bladder syndrome&quot; &ndash; This might be a feeling of having to urinate all the time or needing to urinate immediately. Some people also leak urine if they don't get to the bathroom in time. This can happen after surgery, or get worse for people who had it before surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain during sex</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the groin &ndash; This is the area where the thigh meets the rest of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1827030128\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there options besides surgery for stress urinary incontinence?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are other options. These include exercises or a pessary (a device that you wear in the vagina every day to support the urethra). Most women try these other options first. Then, they have surgery if other treatments do not work.</p><p>It's important to remember that the results of surgery to treat stress urinary incontinence are different for every woman. You are the only one who can decide for sure whether surgery is the best treatment for you. If you aren't sure, you might want to try other treatments while you think about surgery. Talk with your doctor about how much surgery might help you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1827030145\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors don't usually do surgery to treat stress urinary incontinence in women who want to get pregnant. That's because pregnancy puts stress on the belly and urinary tract. This can make stress incontinence come back, even after surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1827030160\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Urinary incontinence (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=minimally-invasive-surgery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Minimally invasive surgery (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-muscle-kegel-exercises-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pelvic muscle (Kegel) exercises (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=questions-to-ask-if-you-are-having-surgery-or-a-procedure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Questions to ask if you are having surgery or a procedure (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Urinary incontinence in women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-treatments-for-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Urinary incontinence treatments for women (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
