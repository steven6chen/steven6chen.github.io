The normal physiological alterations in skin during pregnancy are reviewed here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78973\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78973 \">table 1</a>). Pathologic cutaneous changes and their management are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatoses-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermatoses of pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SKIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall clinical appearance of skin is related to pigmentation, glands, vasculature, and connective tissue. Cutaneous changes during pregnancy can be best understood by examining each of these different aspects of skin structure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pigmentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost all pregnant women develop some degree of increased skin pigmentation. This usually occurs in discrete, localized areas and may be due to regional differences in melanocyte density within the epidermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Occasionally, generalized hyperpigmentation occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. However, pregnancy is a rare cause of generalized hyperpigmentation, so other causes, such as Addison's disease, should be considered when it occurs.</p><p>The pathogenesis of the increased pigmentation is not completely understood. One possibility is that estrogens and progesterone cause melanocytic stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. However, it has been shown that the pigmentary changes occur early in pregnancy and before the elevation in alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) plasma levels, which occur in late gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The most frequent cutaneous pigmentary change is a darkening of the linea alba, which becomes the linea nigra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The increased pigmentation may span from the pubic symphysis to the xiphoid process, but usually reverts to its normal hypopigmented state postpartum.</p><p>The skin around the areola also darkens and extends outward in a net-like array, referred to as the secondary areola [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Other anatomic areas that develop hyperpigmentation are the nipples, axillae, genitalia, perineum, anus, inner thighs, and the neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A darker hue may also be noted in recent scars, freckles, and lentigines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. In addition, pigmentary demarcation lines may become visible during pregnancy. These areas of sharp delineation between naturally more pigmented and less pigmented skin are reported most commonly on the legs of Japanese and Black women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Postpartum, hyperpigmented areas become less pigmented over a period of several months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Nevi</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are conflicting data about changes in nevi during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In one study of 86 Caucasian gravida, one-third of women reported a change in nevi during pregnancy and pregnant women had more atypia in their nevi than non-pregnant women, but not more than men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Another study of nevi on the back of pregnant women found no significant change during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>We believe that histologic atypia in nevi should <strong>not</strong> be attributed to the pregnancy. All nevi that change in any manner that would raise concern in the nonpregnant patient should be examined histologically in the pregnant patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15</a>].

The characteristic hyperpigmentation of the face may also occur in nonpregnant women and women taking oral contraceptive pills. The three clinical melasma patterns are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Centrofacial &mdash; involving the cheeks, forehead, upper lip, nose and chin </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malar &mdash; involving the cheeks and nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mandibular &mdash; involving the ramus of the mandible.</p><p/><p>There is conflicting information about the frequency of each type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/5,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16</a>]. It is possible that different skin <span class=\"nowrap\">types/ethnicities,</span> as well as different climates, play a role in which pattern is more common.</p><p>There are two main histological patterns: epidermal and dermal. Both patterns have increased numbers of melanocytes. However, patients with the epidermal type will have pigmentary accentuation under a Wood's light, whereas those with dermal melasma will exhibit no enhancement. In addition, some women have a &quot;mixed&quot; picture on Wood's light examination, with enhancement in some areas and none in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In natural light, epidermal melasma appears light brown, the mixed type looks dark brown, and the dermal pattern is blue or ashen gray. Epidermal melasma seems to be the type most responsive to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Genetic factors probably contribute to melasma and cosmetics may play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Solar irradiation is important in maintaining the hyperpigmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], thus, protection from the sun (including use of sun block) is an essential part of a preventive treatment regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>].</p><p>Melasma due to pregnancy usually regresses within one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, areas of hyperpigmentation may never completely resolve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For postpartum patients who desire therapy of persistent melasma, first-line therapy consists of topical therapy, which may include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroquinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroquinone</a>, acids, retinoids, or a combination, depending on their tolerability for the patient. &quot;Triple combination cream&quot; includes hydroquinone, a retinoid, and a topical steroid cream [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A chemical peel can be considered if this approach fails. Laser treatments and dermabrasion have also been tried [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Pregnancy induced variations in vascular structure result in numerous changes observed in or through the skin, and usually regress postpartum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276253908\"><span class=\"h3\">Spider angiomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vascular spiders (spider angiomas, nevi aranei, arterial spiders, spider nevi) develop in 66 percent of Caucasians and 11 percent of blacks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74047\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74047 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. They appear in the second to fifth month of pregnancy as red lesions with branches extending out from a central puncta. Vascular spiders are most common around the eyes and occur almost exclusively in areas drained by the superior vena cava: neck; face; upper chest; arms; and hands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. Telangiectasias in a dermatomal distribution, termed unilateral nevoid telangiectasia or unilateral dermatomal superficial telangiectasia, may appear during pregnancy, as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Most (90 percent) vascular changes regress by three months postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. Persistent spider <span class=\"nowrap\">veins/telangiectasias</span> of the lower extremity can be cosmetically disturbing to patients and can be treated with sclerotherapy or with lasers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

These changes are observed in 66 percent of Caucasians and 33 percent of blacks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H276253922\"><span class=\"h3\">Varicosities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Saphenous, vulvar, and hemorrhoidal varicosities all occur at an increased rate during pregnancy and cannot be prevented. The etiology is partly hemodynamic, due to increased blood volume and venous pressure in femoral and pelvic vessels from the enlarging uterus. Genetic predisposition also plays a role.</p><p>Supportive therapy of leg varicosities includes leg elevation, compression with support hose, sleeping on the left side, exercise, and avoidance of long periods of standing or sitting. Postpartum, medical or surgical intervention can be considered after three to six months, and depends on the clinical severity and nature of underlying venous reflux, as well as the patient's future childbearing plans. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-management-of-lower-extremity-chronic-venous-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and management of lower extremity chronic venous disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Jacquemier's sign refers to venous distention in the vestibule and vagina and is associated with vulvar varicosities, which are particularly difficult to treat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The varicosities may appear like a &quot;bag of worms&quot; in the enlarged labia. They usually regress, at least partially, postpartum. During pregnancy, they are managed conservatively by vulvar support and compression and by avoiding prolonged standing. Symptomatic varicosities that do not resolve postpartum have been treated by sclerotherapy, excision, embolization, and ligation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]. The treatment depends on the size and source of the varicosities. Vulvar varicosities may be associated with pelvic congestion syndrome. They can be misdiagnosed as cysts or masses, including disorders of the Bartholin glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Pyogenic granulomas (granuloma gravidarum, pregnancy tumor, pregnancy epulis) are exophytic, reddish purple papules made up of granulation tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F60189\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60189 \">picture 5</a>). They tend to begin in the first half of pregnancy, most commonly on the anterior mandibular or maxillary gingiva (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66965\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66965 \">picture 6</a>), but also on fingers, and then partially regress postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. The time to regression is unclear, but can take weeks to months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>Plaque and calculus should be removed, but the pregnancy granuloma should not be excised during pregnancy, as it may resolve after parturition. Persistent, bothersome lesions can be excised and should be biopsied if there is any question about the diagnosis.</p><p>Hemangiomas, subcutaneous hemangioendotheliomas, and glomangiomas (glomus tumors) occur in up to 5 percent of pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/1,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,29</a>].

Stretch marks begin as <span class=\"nowrap\">pink/violaceous</span> linear patches in the sixth to seventh month of gestation. They evolve into linear depressions, with fine wrinkles and hypopigmentation. Stretch marks are most prominent on the abdomen, breasts, and thighs, but also arise on the lower back, buttocks, hips and upper arms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/2,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,32</a>].</p><p>The etiology of stretch marks appears to be a diminution of elastin fibers and fibrillin microfibrils in the dermis related to hormonal and physical factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The orientation of these fibers also changes from the normal pattern (perpendicular to the dermal-epidermal junction) to an abnormal parallel pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>There is a strong familial predisposition to development of striae gravidarum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Tattoo ink contains inorganic and synthetic organic pigments and is considered a cosmetic by the United States Food and Drug Administration.

Although there are no reports of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including congenital anomalies, associated with tattooing during pregnancy, safety cannot be inferred, given the range of pigments used, dermal injection rather than topical application, and lack of close oversight. Infection is the major concern and has been caused by contamination of the product, as well as nonsterile performance of the tattoo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-skin-hair-nails-and-mucous-membranes/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].
