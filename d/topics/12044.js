This approach allows for optimal exposure of the coronary arteries and a motionless (non-beating) heart, both of which optimize the suturing of the distal anastomoses of the bypass.</p><p>This approach may contribute risk during certain clinical scenarios. For example, patients requiring a repeat CABG are at risk of damage to a previously placed left internal mammary bypass graft during a repeat sternotomy and patients with calcified aortas may be at increased risk of cerebral embolization with cross-clamping of the aorta during cardiopulmonary bypass. </p><p>This topic will discuss clinical outcomes after off-pump and minimally invasive direct CABG, two approaches that have been be evaluated as potential approaches to decrease some of the risks of standard CABG. Complications of CABG using any technique, technical issues related to minimally invasive CABG, and minimally invasive approaches to valvular surgery are discussed separately.

The major rationale for this procedure, which is also called &ldquo;beating heart surgery,&rdquo; is to avoid the morbidity associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (induction of a systemic inflammatory response, activation of platelets) and of cross-clamping the aorta (risk of stroke or systemic embolization).(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minimally-invasive-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-definitions-and-technical-issues#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minimally invasive coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Definitions and technical issues&quot;, section on 'General principles'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from aortic plaque: Thromboembolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>All surgeons performing OPCAB must be competent with the on-pump technique. The off-pump technique is technically more challenging and requires additional training. It has been chosen by some practitioners for high-risk patients with contraindications to conventional CABG, such as those with extensive ascending aortic atheromatous or calcific changes that might preclude safe aortic instrumentation. A potential disadvantage of off-pump surgery is the difficulty of performing distal anastomoses on a beating heart; this might lead to incomplete revascularization if exposure of the back of the heart is challenging or decreased graft patency because of suboptimal conditions during the construction of the distal anastomosis. </p><p>The experience with off-pump CABG and minimally invasive direct CABG has increased dramatically since the late 1990s. An analysis of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database in 1998 and 1999 found that some type of off-pump CABG represented 10 percent of all CABG procedures performed in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/off-pump-and-minimally-invasive-direct-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-outcomes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. By 2001, beating heart techniques accounted for approximately 25 percent of isolated CABG procedures; this figure has not changed significantly since then [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/off-pump-and-minimally-invasive-direct-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-outcomes/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison to on-pump CABG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients undergoing CABG, we perform on-pump rather than off-pump CABG. For patients who are identified as having a particularly high risk of stroke due to manipulation of the aorta with on-pump CABG, the off-pump procedure may be reasonable. There may be other patient populations for whom off-pump CABG may be preferred, but they have not been clearly identified.</p><p>When performed by surgeons comfortable with either procedure, off- and on-pump CABG appear to deliver comparable outcomes of death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and new renal failure requiring dialysis at 30 days. However, studies of longer-term follow-up have found lower survival rates with off-pump CABG. The rate of repeat revascularization, often due to less complete revascularization or worse graft patency, appears to be higher with off-pump CABG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-causes-and-rates-of-graft-failure#H7889875\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Causes and rates of graft failure&quot;, section on 'Off-pump versus on-pump CABG'</a>.)</p><p>Although initial observational studies with off-pump CABG suggested similar or better outcomes compared with conventional on-pump CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/off-pump-and-minimally-invasive-direct-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-outcomes/abstract/1,5-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5-14</a>], conclusions were likely flawed due to multiple sources of bias. Other randomized trials have been too small to demonstrate conclusive clinical superiority of either surgical approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/off-pump-and-minimally-invasive-direct-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-outcomes/abstract/15-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-23</a>]. </p><p>A 2012 meta-analysis and systematic review of 86 randomized trials (excluding the CORONARY and GOPCABE studies, as well as the five-year results of the ROOBY trial, presented below) compared the two surgical techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/off-pump-and-minimally-invasive-direct-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-outcomes/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Off-pump CABG significantly increased all-cause (long-term) mortality in all trials and in the 10 trials (nearly 5000 patients) at low risk of bias (3.7 versus 3.1 percent; relative risk 1.24; 95% CI 1.01-1.53 and 6.2 versus 4.6 percent; relative risk 1.35; 95% CI 1.07-1.70, respectively). </p><p>Many of the limitations of early observational studies and randomized trials have been directly addressed by three large randomized trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ROOBY trial (2009) randomly assigned 2203 relatively low-risk patients scheduled for elective or urgent CABG to either an off- or on-pump procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/off-pump-and-minimally-invasive-direct-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-outcomes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. There was no significant difference in the composite short-term primary outcome (death, reoperation, new mechanical support, cardiac arrest, coma, stroke, or renal failure before discharge or within 30 days) between the off- and on-pump groups (7.0 versus 5.6 percent; relative risk [RR] 1.26, 95% CI 0.91-1.74, respectively). However, the rate of the composite long-term (one year) primary outcome was significantly higher in the off-pump group (9.9 versus 7.4 percent, RR 2.5, 95% CI 1.01-1.76), including a significant increase in the rate of death from cardiac causes (2.7 versus 1.3 percent). The proportion of patients with fewer grafts completed than originally planned was significantly higher in the off-pump group (17.8 versus 11 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">At five years, the rate of death was higher with off-pump CABG (15.2 versus 11.9 percent; RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.03-1.58) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/off-pump-and-minimally-invasive-direct-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-outcomes/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Approximately, 43 percent of the deaths were cardiac related. The rate of the other five-year primary end point (a composite of death from any cause, repeat revascularization, or nonfatal myocardial infarction) was also, higher with off-pump CABG (31.0 versus 27.1 percent; RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.00-1.30).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An angiographic follow-up study of 1370 patients enrolled in ROOBY evaluated graft patency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/off-pump-and-minimally-invasive-direct-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-outcomes/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. At one year, graft patency was significantly worse in those who received off-pump CABG (82.6 versus 87.8 percent), attributable primarily to a lower overall patency in saphenous vein grafts (76.6 versus 83.8 percent). The one-year adverse cardiac event rate (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or repeat revascularization) was significantly lower in patients with effective, compared to ineffective, revascularization (5.9 versus 16.4 percent). Effective revascularization was defined as follows: All three major coronary territories with significant disease (at randomization) were revascularized with a patent graft, which was placed in proper position relative to the native disease, and there were no new postanastomotic lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The CORONARY trial (2012) randomly assigned 4752 patients scheduled to undergo isolated CABG surgery to either an off- or on-pump procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/off-pump-and-minimally-invasive-direct-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-outcomes/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

However, the rate of repeat revascularization was significantly increased in the off-pump group (0.7 versus 0.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/off-pump-and-minimally-invasive-direct-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-outcomes/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><br/>At one year, there was no significant difference in the rate of the primary composite outcome (12.1 versus 13.3 percent, respectively; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77-1.07) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/off-pump-and-minimally-invasive-direct-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-outcomes/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

In an observational study of 274 patients, the one-year mortality was 2 percent and the reintervention rate was 2.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/off-pump-and-minimally-invasive-direct-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-outcomes/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. However, there is little high-quality evidence to suggest that it is superior to a median sternotomy for outcomes of death, stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or repeat revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/off-pump-and-minimally-invasive-direct-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-outcomes/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>]. </p><p>We believe that a sternal approach allows for more complete revascularization in most instances.

This approach may be preferable if a bypass graft to the lateral wall of the heart needs to be revised and is thought to be feasible to perform without cardiopulmonary bypass.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients in whom a hybrid approach to coronary revascularization is entertained. (See <a href=\"#H1054564229\" class=\"local\">'Hybrid revascularization procedures'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Early randomized trials compared MIDCAB to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), but the ability to apply their conclusions to current practice is limited due to factors such as the predominant use of bare metal stents (compared to drug-eluting stents), relatively short follow-up, and inconsistent use of current adjunctive medical therapies such as aggressive antiplatelet therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/off-pump-and-minimally-invasive-direct-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-outcomes/abstract/65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67</a>]. In three small randomized trials of patients with isolated LAD disease, MIDCAB was associated with a marked reduction in the need for target vessel revascularization consequent to restenosis at six months compared to PCI with bare-metal stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/off-pump-and-minimally-invasive-direct-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-outcomes/abstract/65,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,67</a>].

In addition, it can approach lesions that cannot be treated with PCI, such as those that have excessive length, angulation, tortuosity, or complex lesions.</p><p>Although incisions that are alternatives to median sternotomy are thought to be less invasive, the incidence of wound complications, such as incisional hernia, dehiscence, seroma formation, and infection, with an anterior thoracotomy (MIDCAB) incision is significant (9 versus 1 percent with standard median sternotomy) and may have been underreported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/off-pump-and-minimally-invasive-direct-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-outcomes/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

It states &ldquo;&hellip;most surgeons consider either approach to be reasonable for the majority of subjects undergoing CABG&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1036580514\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Off-pump and minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass graft surgery (MIDCAB) are techniques that were designed to lower the rates of some complications of on-pump CABG using a median sternotomy in patients who are thought to be at higher risk because of co-morbidities. In choosing one approach compared to another, multiple patient and practitioner characteristics need to be taken into account. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Off-pump CABG'</a> above and <a href=\"#H965600082\" class=\"local\">'MIDCAB'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 30-day and one-year results of off- and on-pump CABG are comparable for composite outcomes that include death, stroke, and nonfatal myocardial infarction. However, at one year, the rate of revascularization appears to be increased with off-pump CABG. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Comparison to on-pump CABG'</a> above.)<br/><br/>For most patients who are referred for CABG, we suggest an on-pump as opposed to off-pump procedure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Patients felt to be at high risk of stroke due to aortic manipulation may reasonably choose off-pump CABG after taking into account the expertise of the surgeon and outcomes at a particular institution. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term &ldquo;MIDCAB&rdquo; is applied to procedures that use alternatives to standard median sternotomy. <br/><br/>The choice between the two approaches likely depends on local expertise and the revascularization necessary. In patients undergoing left anterior descending coronary artery bypass, a MIDCAB may be preferable, whereas a sternal approach may be a better choice in patients undergoing multivessel bypass. (See <a href=\"#H965600082\" class=\"local\">'MIDCAB'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hybrid revascularization techniques are in evolution and combine the survival benefit of the left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery graft and the less invasive nature of percutaneous coronary intervention of other disease vessels. (See <a href=\"#H1054564229\" class=\"local\">'Hybrid revascularization procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H373352437\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The UpToDate editorial staff would&nbsp;like to thank Drs.
