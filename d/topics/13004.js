In 1913, Simon Flexner's introduction of intrathecal meningococcal antiserum prevented some deaths, but the clinical outcome did not dramatically improve until the advent of systemic antimicrobial therapy in the 1930s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Despite the effectiveness of current antibiotics in clearing bacteria from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), bacterial meningitis continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. In two large case series, for example, the case-fatality rate for adults with bacterial meningitis was approximately 25 percent, and transient or permanent neurologic morbidity occurred in 21 to 28 percent of survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Much of the damage from this infection is believed to result from cytokines released within the CSF as the host mounts an inflammatory response. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic complications of bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinically important issues related to the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of bacterial meningitis will be reviewed here. The clinical features, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of bacterial meningitis in adults and children and issues related to chronic and recurrent meningitis are discussed separately.

For the most common pathogens causing bacterial meningitis in adults, such as <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>, meningeal invasion is related to several virulence factors that allow the bacteria to colonize host mucosal epithelium, invade and survive within the bloodstream, cross the blood-brain barrier, and multiply within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-and-pathobiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology and pathobiology of Neisseria meningitidis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-neisseria-meningitidis-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of Neisseria meningitidis infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Colonization and invasion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the major meningeal pathogens possess surface components, such as fimbriae or pili, that enhance mucosal colonization. The main requirement for meningococcal adhesion is type IV pili, which adhere via various receptors including PAFR, beta-2 adrenergic receptors, and CD147 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; meningococcal outer membrane proteins have also been proposed to contribute to the maintenance of adhesion. Colonization of the host mucosal epithelium is facilitated by evasion of mucosal secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) through pathogen secretion of IgA protease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. IgA protease inactivates the mucosal antibody and facilitates bacterial attachment to host epithelial cells. After successful colonization, invasion occurs across the epithelium via intracellular or intercellular pathways that are mediated by specific binding adhesins of the bacterial surface, many of which are localized to pili in gram-negative pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. After attachment and aggregation of <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em>, organisms detach from the aggregates to systematically invade the host by means of a transcellular pathway that crosses the respiratory epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Surface encapsulation may also be an important virulence factor for nasopharyngeal colonization and systemic invasion of meningeal pathogens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravascular survival</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following invasion and entry into the bloodstream, bacteria survive through evasion of the complement system, particularly the alternative complement pathway. The bacterial capsular polysaccharide is the major mechanism for alternative complement evasion. As an example, the capsular sialic acid of <em>N. meningitidis</em> prevents binding of factor B to C3b and subsequent activation of the alternative pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. For <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, C3b binds inefficiently to factor B on the capsular surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In either case, the pathogens avoid the bactericidal activity of complement, survive in the bloodstream, and cross the blood-brain barrier into the CSF.</p><p>In contrast with these inhibitory effects on alternate pathway activity in the bloodstream, classical pathway complement activation may occur in the central nervous system and contribute to tissue injury in pneumococcal meningitis. This was suggested by studies in animal models of pneumococcal meningitis in which the administration of a C1 inhibitor, which inhibits the early phase of the classic complement pathway, was associated with increased bacterial clearance, reduced clinical illness, a less intense meningeal inflammatory infiltrate, and lower brain levels of proinflammatory cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>After bacterial invasion into the bloodstream, the complement system, inflammatory response, and fibrinolytic systems (which interact with one another) are activated. Genetic polymorphisms occur among the components of these pathways, and these polymorphisms are involved in determining susceptibility to infection, severity of disease, and outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Studies that have investigated the role of host genetic susceptibility in pneumococcal and meningococcal disease have led to the discovery of genetic correlates in the complement system of increased susceptibility to meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Specifically, C2 deficiency has been reported in patients with pneumococcal meningitis, factor D deficiency predisposes to meningococcal disease, and properdin deficiency increases susceptibility to infection with meningococcal serogroups W135 and Y [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In another study of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the complement system, SNPs in C3 were associated with reduced susceptibility to meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These associations require further study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Meningeal invasion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The precise topographic site of bacterial entry into the CSF is unclear and may be distinct for different pathogens. For some pathogens such as <em>Escherichia coli</em>, experimental evidence suggests that CSF entry occurs at the choroid plexus and is facilitated by the presence of S fimbriae on the bacterial surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, all of the surface structures of <em>E. coli</em> K1 have the potential to interact with brain microvascular endothelial cells for invasion and entry into the central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. By contrast, the phosphorylcholine moiety of the pneumococcal cell wall lipoteichoic acid appears to utilize endogenous receptors for platelet activating factor (PAF) to facilitate attachment and transcellular migration across endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/7,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,19</a>]. However, studies have shown that pathogens can cross the blood-brain barrier transcellularly, paracellularly (via disruption of blood-brain barrier integrity), within infected phagocytes, or by a combination of these routes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Although most cases of meningitis probably occur following bacteremia, the high incidence of pneumococcal meningitis in patients with sinusitis and otitis media suggest that direct spread to the central nervous system might also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].However, at least in children, autopsy studies done in the 1980s do not support this pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Upon successful invasion of the CSF, bacteria can multiply to high concentrations (eg, up to 10<sup>7</sup> organisms per milliliter) because of inadequate humoral immunity in the CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Specifically, low concentrations of immunoglobulin and complement within human CSF result in poor opsonic activity, successful bacterial replication, and the subsequent development of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Despite an early influx of leukocytes in bacterial meningitis, host defenses in CSF remain suboptimal because of the lack of functional opsonic and bactericidal activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical disease observed when bacteria enter the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a result of a complex interaction of components of the bacteria and the host inflammatory response. This interaction influences both the blood-brain barrier and neuronal integrity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Contribution of cell wall components</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In experimental animal models, subcapsular bacterial surface components are most important for the induction of CSF inflammation and blood-brain barrier injury. As an example, purified pneumococcal cell wall but not purified capsular polysaccharide induced CSF inflammation similar to live pneumococci when experimentally injected into the cisterna magna of rabbits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Both teichoic acid and peptidoglycan, which are cell wall constituents, were able to provoke this inflammatory response, although the kinetics of the response differed (maximal response to teichoic acid at 5 hours and to peptidoglycan between 5 and 24 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Immune recognition of these bacterial components results in a strong inflammatory response, leading to blood-brain barrier impairment due to recruitment of leukocytes, vascular deregulation, vasculitis, and occlusion of vessels, which cause increased intracranial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> also release pneumolysin after bacterial cell lysis; although pneumolysin does not appear to have a role in antibiotic-induced enhancement of meningeal inflammation, persistence of pneumolysin in the CSF of patients with pneumococcal meningitis is associated with increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Similarly, intracisternal inoculation of lipo-oligosaccharide of <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> or lipopolysaccharide of <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> can induce CSF inflammation and blood-brain barrier injury in a dose- and time-dependent fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Generation of inflammatory cytokines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some studies suggest the mechanism by which these meningeal pathogens induce an inflammatory response and blood-brain barrier injury is through the in situ generation of proinflammatory cytokines. Patients with pneumococcal meningitis show high CSF concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, IL-2, and IL-12) and matrix metalloproteinases, anti-inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta), and chemokines (eg, IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-1a, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/7,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,27-29</a>]. High bacterial density and bacterial breakdown products that may also be generated after treatment with bacteriolytic antibiotics promote higher concentrations of inflammatory mediators, which lead to a higher likelihood of neurologic sequelae and severe disease. These cytokines act in conjunction with bacterial surface components, such as lipopolysaccharides, to induce the synthesis of adhesive glycoproteins on the luminal surface of cerebral endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/27,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29</a>]. These adhesive glycoproteins, such as selectins and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, facilitate localized adhesion and diapedesis of neutrophils into the CSF. Some experimental evidence suggests that use of nonbacteriolytic antibiotics, which reduce the proinflammatory response triggered by cell-wall components, prevent neuronal damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], although more studies are needed.</p><p>Once inflammation is initiated, a series of injuries occur to the endothelium of the blood-brain barrier (eg, separation of intercellular tight junctions) that result in vasogenic brain edema, loss of cerebrovascular autoregulation, and increased intracranial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. This results in localized areas of brain ischemia, cytotoxic injury, and neuronal apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Evidence also suggests that reactive nitrogen intermediates, nitric oxide, peroxynitrite (a powerful oxidative agent), and excitatory amino acids may also play important roles in either the inflammatory process or other pathophysiologic events (including neuronal injury) during bacterial meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Inhibition of many steps in the inflammatory cascade, such as neutrophil recruitment, improves the clinical outcome in meningitis by reducing neuronal loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-pathophysiology-of-bacterial-meningitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The clinical expressions of these pathophysiologic events are the neurologic complications of meningitis including coma, seizures, deafness, and motor, sensory, and cognitive deficits.
