Urothelial (previously known as transitional cell) carcinoma is the predominant histologic type in the United States and Western Europe, where it accounts for approximately 90 percent of bladder cancers. In other areas of the world, such as the Middle East, non-urothelial histologies are more frequent, due at least in part to the prevalence of schistosomiasis.</p><p>Studies of urothelial bladder cancer have identified multiple risk factors, the most important of which are cigarette smoking and various occupational exposures. Numerous other factors have also been identified that may play an etiologic role in some cases of urothelial cancer, although interpretation of the evidence is frequently confounded by exposure to tobacco use.</p><p>The epidemiology and risk factors associated with urothelial cancer of the bladder will be reviewed here. Non-urothelial bladder cancer is discussed separately.

In the United States, approximately 81,000 new cases and 17,000 deaths occur each year due to bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In Europe, there were an estimated 118,000 cases and 52,000 deaths in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In developed regions such as North America and Europe, bladder cancer is predominantly urothelial.</p><p>From 1985 to 2005, the number of bladder cancers diagnosed in the United States increased by over 50 percent, while from 1975 to 1996 the five-year survival rate for those diagnosed with bladder cancer increased from 75 to 81 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Mortality rates in several western European countries have shown similar downward trends over the last two decades, but are still increasing in some eastern European countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Many bladder cancer patients do not die of their disease but do experience multiple recurrences. As a consequence, there are a relatively large number of people alive with a history of bladder cancer. In middle-aged and older adult men, bladder cancer is the second most prevalent malignancy after prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Geographic distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Geographically, there is a wide variation in the incidence of urothelial cancer of the bladder, with western Europe and North America having the highest incidence and eastern Europe and Asian countries having the lowest rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Even within the United States there are substantial regional differences in the incidence of bladder cancer, with the highest incidence in the Northeast and with Hawaii and Utah having less than one-half the incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These differences are only slightly attenuated after controlling for smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Age, sex, and race</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bladder cancer is typically diagnosed in older individuals, with a median age at diagnosis of 69 years in men and 71 in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The incidence increases with age from 142 to 296 per 100,000 in men aged 65 to 69 years and 85 and over, respectively, and from 33 to 74 per 100,000 in women in the same age groups. The age of onset is younger in current smokers than in never-smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The relative risk for current versus never cigarette smokers is the same in men and women (4.0 and 4.7, respectively), reflecting converging smoking patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Cigarette smoke'</a> below.)</p><p>Although extremely rare, bladder cancer can be seen in children and young adults, where it usually presents with low-grade, non-invasive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>There are racial and ethnic variations in bladder cancer incidence. In the United States, white males have the highest risk with roughly twice the incidence seen in African-American and Hispanic men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Postulated explanations for these racial and ethnic differences include variations in acetylator phenotypes among different <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> groups and occupational differences among minorities that influence exposure to industrial carcinogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Occupational carcinogen exposure'</a> below and <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'Detoxification of carcinogens'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to differences in incidence, sex and race also affect the stage at presentation and prognosis. Although the overall incidence of bladder cancer is lower in women and African-Americans, these groups have more advanced-stage tumors at presentation compared with white men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Environmental exposures account for most cases of bladder cancer. The surface epithelium (urothelium) that lines the mucosal surfaces of the entire urinary tract is exposed to potential carcinogens that are either excreted in the urine or activated from precursors in the urine by hydrolyzing enzymes. This &quot;field cancerization&quot; effect is one hypothesis to explain the multifocal occurrence that is a characteristic feature of urothelial carcinomas of both the urinary bladder and the upper urinary tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>].</p><p>However, in the majority of cases, multifocal urothelial carcinomas are monoclonal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/20,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22-24</a>]. This supports their presumed origin from a single genetically altered cell, which then spreads through the urothelium via intraluminal seeding or intraepithelial migration. This is referred to as the monoclonality hypothesis.</p><p>Although the monoclonality hypothesis appears to conflict with field cancerization, both mechanisms are probably operative in urothelial carcinogenesis, as has been shown with squamous carcinogenesis in the oral cavity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors for head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemical carcinogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemical carcinogenesis is believed to be responsible for much of the burden of bladder cancer, including the increased risk associated with cigarette smoke as well as various industrial exposures. The relationship of bladder cancer to chemical carcinogens was initially suggested by the high incidence of bladder cancer in workers with particular chemical exposures. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Occupational carcinogen exposure'</a> below.)</p><p>Subsequent epidemiologic and laboratory studies have identified a large number of chemical compounds thought to be carcinogenic. Most are aromatic amines, such as 2-naphthylamine, benzidine, and their precursors or derivatives. Other well-characterized carcinogenic chemicals include 4-aminobiphenyl, 4-nitrobiphenyl, and 2-amino-1-naphthol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. The long latent period between exposure and the development of urothelial carcinoma, combined with exposures to multiple compounds, has complicated studies attempting to identify specific carcinogens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Cigarette smoke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cigarette smoking is the most important factor contributing to the overall incidence of urothelial cancer in western countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. The carcinogenic compounds present in cigarettes that are responsible for bladder cancer have not been definitively identified. There are over 60 known carcinogens and reactive oxygen species present, including 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, N-nitroso compounds, and unsaturated aldehydes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p>The relationship between smoking and the risk of bladder cancer is illustrated by a prospective analysis in the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study Cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This database included over 465,000 individuals followed from 1995 to 2006 in the United States. For current smokers, there was a significant increase in the risk of bladder cancer for both men and women (multivariate adjusted hazard ratios [HRs] 3.89 and 4.65, respectively). Although there was an attenuation of risk in former smokers, the risk remained significantly elevated (HRs 2.14 and 2.52 for men and women, respectively). There was a small, but statistically significant increase in the incidence of bladder cancer among men who smoked a pipe or cigars but not cigarettes (HR 1.29).</p><p>In this analysis, the population attributable risk was 50 and 52 percent for men and women, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Compared with prospective cohort studies from earlier time periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>], the percentage of cases attributable to cigarette smoking has remained constant in men despite a decrease in the overall incidence of smoking, while the percentage has increased in women, presumably reflecting the increase in cigarette smoking among women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Increases in the content of specific carcinogens such as beta naphthylamine in cigarettes were postulated as contributing to these changes.</p><p>The extent of smoking appears to be related to the aggressiveness of bladder cancer. In a study of 740 patients diagnosed over a 22 year period, heavy smokers (&ge;30 pack years) were more likely to have a high-grade tumor and to have muscle invasive disease at their original presentation compared with non-smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h4\">Smoking cessation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smoking cessation decreases but does not eliminate the increased risk of bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. </p><p>A meta-analysis that included data from 88 studies found that the relative risks of bladder cancer for all smokers, current smokers, and former smokers compared with nonsmokers were 2.62 (95% CI 2.43-2.83), 3.49 (3.13-3.88), and 2.07 (1.84-2.33), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Smoking cessation also appears to decrease the recurrence rate for patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer even after the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Approaches to smoking cessation are discussed separately.

Women who lived with two or more smokers during childhood had a threefold increased risk of bladder cancer compared with those without a childhood exposure to secondhand smoke, while women with a domestic partner who smoked for 10 or more years had a twofold increased risk compared with those without such exposure. These associations were not observed in male never-smokers.</p><p>Levels of environmental carcinogens were compared in those with exposure to secondhand smoke by directly quantifying 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) hemoglobin adducts, which are established biomarkers of 4-ABP exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Mean levels of 4-ABP adducts were highest in those women with current exposure to environmental smoke and lowest in those with no history of exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Occupational carcinogen exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relationship between workplace exposure to various chemical carcinogens and an increased risk of urothelial cancer was first noted over a century ago. Such exposures are thought to account for approximately 10 to 20 percent of bladder cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. For workers with substantial industrial exposure, the risk may be elevated as much as 200-fold compared with matched controls without such chemical carcinogen exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The risk of death from bladder cancer appears to be elevated for more than 30 years after cessation of exposure to occupational carcinogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Occupations that have been linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer include metal workers, painters, rubber industry workers, leather workers, textile and electrical workers, miners, cement workers, transport operators, excavating-machine operators, and jobs that involve manufacture of carpets, paints, plastics, and industrial chemicals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/25,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,42,43</a>].</p><p>Bladder cancer also has been associated with exposure to paint components, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and diesel exhausts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. In a cohort study that included more than 58,000 men in the Netherlands, investigators found only &quot;marginal&quot; evidence for increased risk of bladder cancer due to diesel exhaust, although this risk was more pronounced in current smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 35 studies reviewing occupational exposure to diesel exhaust, the summary relative risk (RR) of developing bladder cancer was 1.13 (95% CI 1-1.27) with a positive dose response relation (RR 1.44 for high diesel exposure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Firefighters are exposed to a variety of potential chemical carcinogens at the scene of a fire and its aftermath, as well as at the firehouse. Potential carcinogenic compounds include benzene, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and diesel exhausts, among others. Although some individual studies found a modest increase in the risk of developing bladder cancer among firefighters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/44,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46,47</a>], two meta-analyses could not identify clear evidence that employment as a firefighter was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p>Carcinogenic compounds have also been identified in hair dyes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Numerous epidemiologic studies have investigated the relationship between occupational exposure to hair dye use and the risk of bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/51-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-55</a>]. As an example, a fivefold increase in risk of bladder cancer was observed in subjects who worked for 10 or more years as hairdressers or barbers in a population-based case-control study of 1514 incident cases of bladder cancer in Los Angeles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Changes in hair dye formulations and the widespread implementation of safety measures appear to have decreased this risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>This increase in risk does not appear to extend to personal users of such hair dyes.

Many governments now set limits on the maximum level permissible in drinking water.</p><p>Several epidemiologic studies have investigated a possible relationship between chlorination of drinking water and the risk of bladder cancer. A meta-analysis that included six case-control and two cohort studies with more than 6000 bladder cancer cases and 10,000 controls in total showed that long-term consumption of chlorinated drinking water was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer in men (odds ratio [OR] 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.9) and a nonsignificant increase in women (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.7-1.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Further evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from a study suggesting that ozonation decreases the concentration of THMs and reduces the risk of bladder cancer associated with the chlorination of drinking water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Arsenic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple epidemiologic studies have established a link between high concentrations of arsenic in drinking water and the subsequent development of bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>]. This relationship has been most clearly defined in areas of Chile and Taiwan, where subsequent removal of arsenic from drinking water sources led to a decline in the incidence of bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>].

There are two known N-acetyltransferase genes (NAT1 and NAT2), which are important acetylating enzymes. The NAT2 enzyme is polymorphic and variations in the activity of NAT2 have been implicated as risk factors in the pathogenesis of bladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>]. Two normal NAT2 alleles allow for rapid acetylation and &quot;fast&quot; deactivation of carcinogens. In contrast, &quot;slow&quot; acetylators, who have two altered NAT2 alleles, appear to be at increased risk for bladder cancer when exposed to cigarette smoke or occupational aromatic amines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>].

Using the predominantly male European study population and assuming a 2.5-fold increased risk of bladder cancer from smoking, the authors estimated that the population attributable risk was 35 percent for slow acetylators who had ever smoked and 13 percent for rapid acetylators who had ever smoked.</p><p>Another enzyme that may detoxify carcinogens in urine is glutathione S transferase M1 (GSTM1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>].
