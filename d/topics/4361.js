Included in this type of therapy are herbs, acupuncture, chiropractic, and massage, among others. Use of these therapies is common in the general population.</p><p>The use of CAM is widespread. Multiple studies have found that within one year, up to 90 percent of patients with cancer used a CAM approach for at least a part of their therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/2-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-10</a>]. However, patients may not reveal the use of CAM unless specifically asked. In one study, disclosure of the use of these therapies increased from 7 to 43 percent when directed questions were added to standard history taking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Unfortunately, communication between oncologists and patients about CAM is poor, infrequent, and mostly initiated by patients or their kin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Users of CAM are generally <strong>not</strong> dissatisfied with conventional medicine but find alternatives to be more congruent with their own values, beliefs, and philosophical orientations toward health and life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Factors reported to be associated with use of CAM therapies in cancer patients include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased psychosocial stress (eg, anxiety, depression) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being given a less hopeful prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having the feeling of &quot;nothing to lose&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attending support groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age (younger versus older) and gender (women more than men) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]</p><p/><p>Despite the current popularity of CAM, most mainstream oncologists have little understanding of these therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and fewer than one-half initiate discussions about their use with patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, patients with cancer report feeling that their doctors &quot;should be more interested in, more informed about, and more willing to discuss unconventional therapies&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Although many patients assume that CAM is associated with beneficial effects, at least one Norwegian longitudinal study of 515 cancer patients suggests that CAM use may be associated with shorter survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>A review of the available evidence regarding CAM in cancer therapy is presented here. The primary focus is on results from clinical trials; uncontrolled trials are considered in areas where controlled studies are not available. The use of complementary therapies for patients with cancer-related pain is addressed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychological-rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-cancer-pain#H44713488\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychological, rehabilitative, and integrative therapies for cancer pain&quot;, section on 'Integrative therapies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ALTERNATIVE CANCER TREATMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the purpose of this discussion, alternative cancer treatments (ACTs) are defined as CAM therapies that are promoted for reducing tumor burden or prolonging the life of cancer patients. These are typically biologically active and promoted as replacements for, rather than adjuncts to, mainstream therapy. The use of ACTs dates back to the 1940s with the use of Koch antitoxins, and new therapies have been introduced each decade, including Hoxsey treatment in the 1950s, krebiozen in the 60s, laetrile in the 70s (which is again popular today [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]), immunotherapy in the 80s, and Di Bella therapy in the 90s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>All of these therapies have evolved through a strikingly similar life cycle; initially they were aggressively promoted by interested parties based on anecdotal evidence. Mainstream oncologists eventually succumbed to mounting pressure, conducting rigorous clinical trials. When these turned out to be negative, proponents claimed that the studies were flawed and that a conspiracy was underway to discredit a valuable therapy. In the end, each of these therapies submerged into a medical subculture, and cancer patients continued to be attracted to them despite negative scientific evidence.</p><p>The following ACTs are currently popular and will be discussed in more detail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary treatments</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Herbal medicinal products</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonherbal supplements</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diet can influence cancer outcomes.

However, a systematic review of the evidence found that none of the many dietary regimens has been convincingly shown to cure cancer or significantly prolong the life of cancer patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Gerson regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One retrospective comparative analysis reported a six-fold increase in five-year survival rates of melanoma patients treated with the Gerson diet (a low sodium, high potassium, lactovegetarian diet that emphasizes fresh vegetables, fruit juices, and vitamin supplements), but the flawed methodology limits the reliability of this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

In addition, one-third of cancer patients on a macrobiotic diet experience problems due to weight loss, the restrictive and unpalatable nature of the regimen, time spent preparing the food, and the expense and inaccessibility of some ingredients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Kelley-Gonzalez regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Kelley-Gonzalez regimen refers to a program of dietary restriction, intake of digestive aids (eg, pepsin and pancreatic enzymes), and a &quot;detoxification&quot; regimen that includes frequent coffee enemas. In one study that included 36 patients with unresectable or incompletely resected pancreatic cancer, only 11 were considered assessable for outcome for various reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The median survival of treated patients was 17 months, compared with a literature control of four to six months. A trial comparing this therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> for pancreatic cancer was underway at Columbia University, but accrual issues forced a redesign of the study, which now compares outcome in patients who elect to receive the Gonzalez regimen with an externally matched group who receive standard gemcitabine-based combination chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Selected vegetables and herb mix</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Selected vegetables and herb mix (SV) is a blended, boiled, and freeze-dried product containing ingredients with purported immune-stimulatory and anticancer properties: soybeans, mushrooms, mung beans, red dates, scallion, garlic, lentils, leek, hawthorn fruit, onion, ginseng, angelica, dandelion, senega root, licorice, ginger, olives, sesame seeds, and parsley. Two small studies have been conducted in patients with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In a matched-control study involving patients with stage <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV</span> non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), median survival duration among the 11 patients who ingested SV daily was three-fold longer than that of 13 patients who did not receive the supplement (15 versus 4 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Alternative medicine use was independently associated with a greater risk of death (hazard ratio 2.50, 95% CI 1.88-3.27).

Nevertheless, outlandish and irresponsible claims continue to be published in the medical literature: &quot;With classic homeopathy it is possible to treat people suffering from cancer. The patients can be helped palliatively as well as curatively&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/221\" class=\"abstract_t\">221</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=homeopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Homeopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thus, it is understandable that oncologists are concerned about the high level of acceptance of alternative therapies by cancer patients. On the other hand, outright rejection of these treatments might be counter-productive for the following reasons:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Every now and then impressive case reports emerge from credible sources. An open mind toward plausible CAM options might therefore be a good general policy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/222\" class=\"abstract_t\">222</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Outright rejection alienates patients and negatively affects the therapeutic relationship.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proponents of these therapies argue that it would be inhumane not to provide such treatments if patients want them. Oncologists should certainly not hinder patients from seeking such help. On the other hand, one should still insist that the usefulness of these therapies be demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt. The use of ineffective supportive treatments is ethically problematic; for instance, it might lead to a situation where such therapies replace others with proven effectiveness. An important point is that claims of efficacy should be supported with acceptable evidence by those who make these claims, rather than rejected through research carried out by those who doubt them. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Alternative cancer treatments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the interest of our patients, we should discuss the (lack of) evidence for alternative therapies openly and objectively. This includes the fact that some treatments carry considerable risks and many are neither associated with prolongation of life nor an enhanced quality of life. Information must be reliable and from reputable sources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complementary-and-alternative-therapies-for-cancer/abstract/223\" class=\"abstract_t\">223</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of complementary therapies in palliative and supportive cancer is a different matter and seems more promising. Several of these therapies have at least some potential for improving quality of life. The common denominator in achieving this goal may turn out to be the promotion of relaxation. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Complementary supportive care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The often emotional conflicts between opponents and proponents of CAM are, to a large degree, a regrettable artifact caused by the lack of reliable evidence in this area. If more convincing data existed, there would be far less room for disagreement. It follows that more research efforts (and research funds) should be directed towards creating reliable evidence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the United States, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine and the National Cancer Institute are supporting well designed studies of alternative medicine.
