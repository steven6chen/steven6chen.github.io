It differs from food allergies, which are mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE) or immunoglobulin G (IgG). The disorder is common, occurring in 0.5 to 1 percent of the general population in most countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The grains that contain the triggering proteins are wheat, barley, and rye. The small intestinal mucosa improves morphologically when treated with a gluten-free diet and relapses when gluten is reintroduced. In a study from an era in which celiac disease was not treated, mortality was 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The appropriate treatment is a gluten-free diet for life, which results in complete resolution of symptoms for most individuals.</p><p>The diagnosis of celiac disease in children is discussed here.

This difference in recommendations reflects a debate about the utility of screening for celiac disease among truly asymptomatic individuals belonging to a high-risk group because the benefit of treating such individuals has not been proven. Guidelines from the United Kingdom encourage testing for the first three of these high-risk groups and suggest consideration of testing for the other groups on this list, as well as for individuals with a variety of nonspecific symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Who should be tested'</a>.)</p><p>The debate continues about whether asymptomatic individuals in these high-risk groups should be screened, and recommendations may change as new information arises about the potential risks and benefits of screening. As an example, a study of a celiac screening program for children with type 1 diabetes mellitus compared clinical characteristics of 71 children with asymptomatic celiac disease with matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The children with celiac disease were slightly thinner (as indicated by a lower body mass index [BMI] z-score), but height, bone mineral density, and diabetes control were similar. Thus, it is reasonable to question the need for celiac screening for patients with type 1 diabetes and no symptoms of celiac disease, and to make treatment decisions on a case-by-case basis, based on a discussion of estimated risks, symptoms, and treatment burden. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=associated-autoimmune-diseases-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Associated autoimmune diseases in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If screening is undertaken for asymptomatic individuals in these high-risk groups, testing should be performed at three years of age or older and on a gluten-containing diet for at least one year. If initial results are negative, screening tests should be repeated at intervals, or if symptoms develop. The optimal time interval for subsequent screening has not been studied, but in our practice, we screen asymptomatic members of these groups every three to five years during childhood. (See <a href=\"#H2750522627\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic members of a high-risk group'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477986526\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW TO TEST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, the first step is to perform serologic testing. The serology results and level of clinical suspicion determine whether to move on to endoscopic biopsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101112\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101112 \">algorithm 1</a>). Patients with positive results of a specific antibody test and characteristic histologic changes of the intestinal mucosa while on a gluten-containing diet are given a provisional diagnosis of celiac disease. The diagnosis is confirmed if there is normalization of antibodies and symptoms (if any) when the patient is on a gluten-free diet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477986532\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibody testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic tests for celiac disease are useful for screening and are an important first step in the diagnosis of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477995188\"><span class=\"h3\">Tissue transglutaminase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients, the most valuable test is for immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies against tissue transglutaminase (tTG-IgA), which is highly sensitive, specific, and more cost-effective than other antibody tests, although false-positive and false-negative results may still occur with some frequency in populations with a low risk for celiac disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75505\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75505 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/6,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11</a>]. Testing should be performed while on a gluten-containing diet. Individuals previously started on a gluten-free diet without prior testing should resume a diet containing ideally at least 3 g <span class=\"nowrap\">gluten/day</span> (equivalent to about one slice of bread daily) for at least six weeks before undergoing antibody testing, although the duration and amount of gluten required for diagnostic accuracy has not been fully clarified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Serologies may become negative within weeks of beginning a gluten-free diet, but may take up to a year or even longer in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13</a>]. </p><p>The diagnostic accuracy of tTG-IgA immunoassays has been optimized by the use of human tTG in place of the nonhuman tTG preparations used in earlier immunoassay kits. Using second-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) technology, the sensitivity and specificity of tTG-IgA antibodies for biopsy-proven celiac disease are generally above 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/1,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14,15</a>]. Sensitivities are somewhat lower in children younger than two years, but are still near 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Rapid office-based test kits have somewhat lower sensitivity and specificity, so a laboratory-based assay is recommended in patients with positive results of the rapid test, or those with negative results of the rapid test but strong clinical suspicion of celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Case reports suggest that tTG-IgA antibodies may be falsely elevated during a febrile illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477995194\"><span class=\"h3\">Other tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing for antiendomysial antibodies (EMA) is as accurate as tTG-IgA, but this test is more expensive and somewhat dependent on operator interpretation. As a result, EMA is typically used as a second-line test, to clarify the diagnosis in patients with equivocal results of tTG-IgA, including asymptomatic members of a high-risk group, as described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/11,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21</a>]. EMA is an immunofluorescence test for IgA antibodies to endomysium, a structure of the smooth muscle connective tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) also has good diagnostic accuracy and may be particularly useful for young children; this is a second-generation antigliadin antibody test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. Standard (first-generation) IgA or immunoglobulin G (IgG) antigliadin antibodies are considerably less reliable and are not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/6,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,27,28</a>]. Tests of antireticulin antibodies have reasonably high specificity, but lower sensitivity, and are no longer commonly used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

We initiate screening around 3 years of age, and repeat the screening every three to five years during childhood. (See <a href=\"#H477994579\" class=\"local\">'High-risk groups'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the results of tTG-IgA antibodies are strongly positive (&gt;3 times the upper limit of normal), we proceed directly to endoscopic biopsy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If tTG-IgA antibodies are only mildly elevated (levels that are positive but &lt;3 times the upper limit of normal), we suggest sequential testing with EMA antibodies. This practice is based on expert opinion, with some support from a study showing that this approach helps to distinguish the patients who are likely to have celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. If the result of the EMA test is negative, it is reasonable to observe the patient and defer doing a biopsy because the chances of finding the characteristic histologic changes of celiac disease in these cases are low. The decision to observe versus proceed to intestinal biopsy is made on a case-by-case basis, depending on the reasons that the patient underwent screening, and the preference of the patient and family. Those who choose to not have a biopsy should be followed closely and undergo repeat serological testing if they ever develop symptoms that are suggestive of celiac disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If tTG-IgA antibodies are negative, it is reasonable to observe the patient and repeat the test if symptoms develop. </p><p/><p>An alternative strategy for asymptomatic individuals in these high-risk groups, and especially for those with Down syndrome, is to assess for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types DQ2 and DQ8 as the initial screening test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/4,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,31,32</a>]. Those who test positive for HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 should then undergo serial screening for celiac-associated antibodies every three to five years as described above. Those who test negative for HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 do not require additional screening because they have a very low risk for developing celiac disease. Although HLA testing is substantially more costly than serologic screening for celiac disease, it does not require serial testing. The cost-effectiveness of this strategy has not been established and depends on the pre-test risk for celiac disease in the population tested, including the likelihood of celiac disease susceptibility alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. This strategy is most appropriate for individuals with Down syndrome, in whom the likelihood of a celiac risk allele is similar to that of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is not likely to be useful for members of other high-risk groups (eg, first-degree relatives of patients with celiac disease) because a high proportion of individuals in these groups will carry HLA susceptibility alleles, so HLA testing is unlikely to be useful to exclude celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in children&quot;, section on 'Genetic factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606087641\"><span class=\"h4\">IgA deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For individuals with known selective IgA deficiency, testing should be performed with IgG antibodies to tTG (tTG-IgG) instead of the usual IgA-based antibody test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Because tTG-IgG has limited specificity, concurrent measurement of a second IgG-based antibody, such as DGP, is suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Approximately 2 percent of children with celiac disease will have previously unrecognized IgA deficiency. Therefore, total IgA should be measured in children with negative results of tTG-IgA but a high clinical suspicion of celiac disease. For all other children, routine measurement of total IgA as part of celiac antibody testing is not cost-effective because the yield is very low. In one report of population screening in Sweden, measurement of total IgA contributed to the diagnosis of celiac disease in only 2 of 7208 children screened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1400248565\"><span class=\"h4\">Children younger than two years</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children younger than two years, both the tTG-IgA and EMA tests are less sensitive for detecting celiac disease as compared with older children, so concurrent assessment of more than one celiac-specific antibody (eg, tTG-IgA, with IgG antibodies to DGP) is suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>].

A possible exception is selected patients with very high results of serologic tests and classic symptoms of celiac disease, as discussed in the next section. The biopsy should be performed with the patient on a gluten-containing diet. Multiple biopsies should be taken (four from the distal duodenum and at least one from the duodenal bulb) because the disease may have a patchy distribution or initially be confined to the duodenal bulb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/6,38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,38-42</a>].

Capsule endoscopy should not be used as a substitute for endoscopy for the initial diagnosis of celiac disease because its diagnostic yield for this disorder is much lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2028516931\"><span class=\"h3\">Is biopsy necessary for all patients?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although intestinal biopsy is valuable for any patient to achieve maximal diagnostic certainty, it is considered <strong>optional</strong> for specific patients with <strong>all</strong> of the following characteristics, as outlined in the European pediatric guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/4,32,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,32,43</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very high results of tTG testing (tTG-IgA &gt;10 times the upper limit of normal) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive results of a second celiac-specific antibody test (eg, EMA or DGP) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal symptoms typical for celiac disease </p><p/><p>If patients with these characteristics choose to forgo intestinal biopsy, the diagnosis is only confirmed if there is a clear clinical response to a gluten-free diet, with normalization of the tTG titers and improvement of symptoms.</p><p>Support for this new approach comes from three large case series, which reported that more than 98 percent of symptomatic patients with very high tTG-IgA and positive EMA had intestinal biopsy results consistent with celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/30,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,44,45</a>]. In one of these studies, the combination of very high tTG-IgA and positive EMA had sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of 69.3, 96.8, and 99.6 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. If malabsorption symptoms (diarrhea, weight loss, poor weight gain, or iron deficiency anemia) were included, specificity and positive predictive value rose to 100 percent. The need to include the second antibody test in this diagnostic approach has been questioned, since adding EMA testing does not improve the positive predictive value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. HLA typing has also been suggested to add strength to the diagnosis (because celiac disease would be effectively excluded in any patient that does not have HLA types DQ2 or DQ8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], although the additional diagnostic value of HLA typing in this setting appears to be modest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. &#160;</p><p>On the other hand, it is important to recognize the potential value of including intestinal biopsy as part of the diagnostic process for all patients, including those with very high tTG antibodies. Histologic confirmation provides for maximal diagnostic certainty, which is important because of the life-long burden of a gluten-free diet. In particular, the endoscopy permits evaluation for concurrent mucosal inflammation other than celiac disease, including eosinophilic esophagitis, Helicobacter pylori (<em>H. pylori</em>), and Crohn disease of the proximal small intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. Moreover, despite the high sensitivity estimates reported above, occasional false-positive results occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/30,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,44,45</a>]. Finally, there are concerns about the quantitative variability and lack of standardization between commercially-available serologic tests for celiac disease. These considerations should be discussed with the patient and family before deciding whether to proceed with intestinal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis before embarking on a gluten-free diet. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477997386\"><span class=\"h3\">Abnormal findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intestinal biopsies should be interpreted by an expert pathologist. The histologic features of celiac disease are usually described using the Marsh classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F89797\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89797 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60343\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60343 \">figure 1</a>); they range from a mild alteration characterized only by increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (Marsh type 1 lesion), to a flat mucosa with total mucosal atrophy, complete loss of villi, enhanced epithelial apoptosis, and crypt hyperplasia (Marsh type 3 lesion) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76680\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76680 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/50-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-55</a>]. The Marsh type 4 lesion has the same histologic features seen in the type 3 lesion except that the crypts are hypoplastic. A gradient of decreasing severity from the proximal to the distal small intestine is often observed, correlating with the higher proximal concentration of dietary gluten. The degree of the villous atrophy does not necessarily correlate with the severity of clinical symptoms, and sampling error can occur due to some inhomogeneity of mucosal inflammation.</p><p>Patients with these abnormal findings are given a provisional diagnosis of celiac disease and should have a trial of treatment with a gluten-free diet (see <a href=\"#H477987213\" class=\"local\">'Gluten-free diet trial'</a> below). Rarely, other disorders can cause similar histologic findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60030 \">table 5</a>). For patients with equivocal findings (eg, Marsh type 1 lesions), management decisions depend on the level of suspicion for celiac disease, including type and severity of symptoms, and results of celiac-specific antibody tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477997328\"><span class=\"h3\">Normal findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with positive tests for tTG-IgA or EMA, but normal results of small bowel biopsies, are considered to have potential celiac disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F95864\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95864 \">table 6</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children#H567878080\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in children&quot;, section on 'Potential celiac disease'</a>). It is important that the evaluation of such patients include expert review of multiple intestinal biopsies since the histologic abnormalities can be patchy. In some cases in which the diagnosis of celiac disease is unclear, testing for <span class=\"nowrap\">HLA-DQ2/DQ8</span> may be helpful because if the result is negative this essentially excludes the possibility of celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In general, we suggest not treating such patients with a gluten-free diet if they do not have symptoms. However, these patients should be carefully monitored for growth failure and other symptoms that might suggest active celiac disease, and should be rebiopsied if symptoms develop. Decisions about whether to begin a gluten-free diet for patients with positive serologic tests but normal biopsy results should be made on a case-by-case basis with the family, after consideration of the patient's level of symptoms, appropriate exclusion of other causes of the symptoms, the burden of maintaining a gluten-free diet, and the adequacy of the biopsied tissue samples.</p><p>These decisions are informed by the following considerations, which take into account a patient's level of symptoms and possibly age or other risk factors that are predictors of the risk of developing overt celiac disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Symptomatic</strong> children with positive serologic tests for celiac disease but apparently normal biopsies are likely to have celiac disease, based on limited evidence. This was suggested by a small series of eight children with some gastrointestinal symptoms and positive serologic tests (antiendomysial antibodies) but normal intestinal histology who continued to consume a gluten-containing diet. Within two years, seven of these eight children had developed marked mucosal atrophy and were diagnosed with celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. These observations suggest that a substantial number of symptomatic children with positive serologic tests but normal biopsies will develop celiac disease within a few years, while in a smaller number the antibodies disappear completely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By contrast, the majority of <strong>asymptomatic</strong> children with positive serologic tests and normal biopsy results will not develop celiac disease during childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. In one study, two-thirds of children with potential celiac disease at baseline still had normal biopsies at nine years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Such patients usually are identified during routine testing performed because they are members of a group at increased risk for celiac disease (eg, first-degree relatives of individuals with celiac disease).

A diagnosis of celiac disease mandates following a strict gluten-free diet for life. The gluten-free diet is burdensome, not easy to follow, is associated with increased costs, and has quality of life implications. For all of these reasons, a gluten-free diet should not be instituted unless there is good evidence for celiac disease. A diagnostic approach for patients who are already on a gluten-free diet is outlined above.

Patients who do not demonstrate a robust serologic response to a gluten-free diet, or whose initial endoscopic biopsies are not typical for celiac disease, may require a second endoscopy with biopsy while on a gluten-free diet to clarify the diagnosis.</p><p>Note that at least one endoscopy with intestinal biopsies is required to establish the diagnosis for most patients; a serologic response to a gluten-free diet is not sufficient (see <a href=\"#H477986957\" class=\"local\">'Intestinal biopsy'</a> above). Similarly, symptom-response to a gluten-free diet alone is not sufficient to diagnose celiac disease because these features do not distinguish between celiac disease and &quot;nonceliac gluten sensitivity,&quot; which is defined as dose-dependent intolerance to gluten-containing grains after exclusion of celiac disease or wheat allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-children/abstract/3,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12</a>].
