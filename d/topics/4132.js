It was commonly referred to as &quot;Fuga Demonum&quot; (the devil's scourge) since it was used to protect against demonic possession and &quot;evil spirits&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. One of the earliest references to the name St. John's wort is noted in a Gaelic legend from the sixth century where the missionary St. Columba carried a piece of St. John's wort because of his high regard for St. John [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is believed that the name may have been derived from the fact that the flowers bloom around June 24th, the birthday of St. John the Baptist. Wort represents the old English term for plant.</p><p>St. John's wort has been utilized mainly for its antidepressant activity, but also for its purported antiinflammatory and wound healing properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The 2007 National Health Interview Survey found a large decrease in St. John's wort use by adults in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In 2002, St. John's wort was the sixth most popular natural product in the United States, used by 2.2 percent of American adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In 2007, St. John's wort was not among the 20 most commonly used dietary supplements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This decrease may reflect the public's response to interim news reports of negative clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>] and potentially harmful interactions with prescription drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/9-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-22</a>].</p><p>Patients considering the use of St. John's wort should be counseled and cautioned regarding evidence of effectiveness and safety, the variability and lack of regulation in St. John's wort products in the United States, and the potential for herb-drug interactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of compounds isolated from St. John's wort possess pharmacologic activity. Naphthodianthrones (hypericin, pseudohypericin, protohypericin, protopseudohypericin, and cyclopseudohypericin), flavonoids (quercetin, rutin, and luteolin), hyperforin, several amino acids, and tannins have been isolated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuropsychiatric activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of in vitro studies of St. John's wort have attempted to define its neuropharmacology. Hyperforin and hypericin have been studied most extensively. Hypericin was originally thought to be the major active component for St. John's wort in depression; however, it is now believed that hyperforin and related compounds are mostly responsible for St. John's wort's effect on mood.</p><p>Hyperforin extracts have been shown to modulate neurotransmitter levels including serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. This may be in part from inhibition of neurotransmitter uptake. Other studies have found that hypericum extract possesses a weak catechol-O-methyl transferase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], and the hypericum extract LI 160 causes 50 percent inhibition of serotonin uptake by rat synaptosomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The latter occurred only at relatively high concentrations.</p><p>St. John's wort standardized extract LI 160 is capable of decreasing cell surface 5-HT receptors. LI 160 also suppresses the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6), which induces the release of corticotropin releasing hormone (implicated in depression) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. St. John's wort extracts also have been shown to inhibit binding at the muscarinic cholinergic receptor (mAchR), 5HT, and norepinephrine uptake sites, but only at high concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Extracts may have further effects upon melatonin secretion, biological rhythms, and sexual activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Others have hypothesized that hypericum extract increases dopamine turnover resulting in an increased concentration of dopamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. MAO inhibition was formerly believed to be a mechanism of St. John's wort, but animal studies suggest that MAO inhibition is minimal and likely not clinically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiviral and antibacterial activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In vitro antiviral activity has been reported against murine cytomegalovirus, parainfluenza 3 virus, Sindbis virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and equine infectious anemia virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. In addition, hypericin and pseudohypericin inhibit herpes simplex types 1 and 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other studies have indicated immunologic and potential clinical benefits of utilizing hypericin in vitro for HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. Hypericin and pseudohypericin display activity against retroviruses in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Hypericin also has antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/3,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,41</a>]. These effects may explain the use of St. John's wort for wound healing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Other activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other activities associated with St. John's wort extracts include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Experimentally induced inflammation and leukocyte infiltration is suppressed in mice using a topical extract of St. John's wort&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flavonoid fractions (mainly quercetin) have analgesic activity in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tannin component of the plant probably exerts an astringent action that may contribute to its purported effectiveness as a wound healing agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral and topical administration of hypericin has been utilized for the treatment of vitiligo and as an antiinflammatory and antiulcerogenic agent, due most likely to the component amentoflavone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EVIDENCE OF EFFECTIVENESS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the inconsistent evidence for efficacy, and the lack of regulated standardized herbal products, we suggest <strong>not</strong> treating depression with St. John's wort. There are also multiple interactions between St. John's wort and many commonly used medications. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Drug interactions'</a> below.)</p><p>Although a 2008 meta-analysis of 29 trials (23 Europe, 4 US, 1 Canada, 1 Brazil) found standardized extracts of St. John's wort to be more effective than placebo and comparable in efficacy to standard antidepressants in the short-term treatment of mild to moderate depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], these results were not observed in the US trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/6-8,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8,45</a>]. Reasons for this discrepancy may include differences in patients enrolled, lack of concealment of treatment allocation, or the variation in herbal preparations studied.

Subjects received intravenous hypericin (0.25 or 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> body weight twice weekly or 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> three times weekly) or oral hypericin (0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily). Treatment was discontinued in 16 of 30 (53 percent) before completing eight weeks because of moderate or severe phototoxicity. Only two patients completed 24 weeks of therapy. No demonstrable antiretroviral activity at the doses tested was noted. Analyses of HIV p24 antigen levels, culture titers, and RNA levels showed no significant changes. Median CD4 cell counts decreased during the study.

These reports contributed to the growing recognition among clinicians of the potential for adverse herb-drug interactions and the need to ask all patients about nonprescription herb and supplement use. Specific interactions of St. John's wort with other medications may be determined using the drug interactions tool (Lexi-Interact Online) included in UpToDate. This tool can be accessed from the UpToDate online search page or through the individual drug information topics in the section on Drug interactions.</p><p>Treatment failures with a wide variety of agents including anticoagulants, antiretrovirals, antifungals, immunosuppressive agents, narcotics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, and hormonal contraceptives have been associated with the concomitant use of St. John's wort due to significant induction of CYP 1A2, 2C19, 2C9, and 3A4, as well as intestinal <span class=\"nowrap\">P-glycoprotein/MDR-1</span> drug transporters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/12-22,64-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-22,64-69</a>].</p><p>Use of St. John's wort should be avoided in combination with other antidepressants until a definitive mechanism of action is elucidated to avoid the potential for the serotonin syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-use-of-st-johns-wort/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].
