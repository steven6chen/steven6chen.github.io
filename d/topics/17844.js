It is a spirochetal infection caused by <em>Borrelia</em> species (<em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> in the United States, and primarily <em>Borrelia afzelii</em> and <em>Borrelia garinii</em> in Europe and Asia) and is transmitted by the bite of infected <em>Ixodes ricinus </em>complex ticks. Lyme disease can involve the skin, joints, nervous system, and heart.</p><p>The Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Academy of Neurology published practice guidelines for the treatment of Lyme disease in the United States in 2006 and 2007, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-lyme-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The treatment of Lyme disease in the United States will be reviewed here and the recommendations largely reflect these guidelines. Antibiotic regimens for the treatment of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> infection are summarized in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59949\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59949 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The microbiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Lyme disease are discussed separately.

However, the clinical features of each stage can overlap and some patients present in a later stage of Lyme disease without a history of prior signs or symptoms suggestive of earlier Lyme disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early localized disease is characterized by the appearance of the characteristic skin lesion, erythema migrans (EM), with or without constitutional symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81270\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81270 \">picture 1</a>). EM usually occurs within one month following the tick bite.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early disseminated disease is characterized by multiple erythema migrans lesions (that typically occur days to weeks after infection) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiac findings (that typically occur weeks to months after infection). Some of these patients have no history of antecedent early localized Lyme disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late Lyme disease is typically associated with intermittent or persistent arthritis involving one or a few large joints, especially the knee (sometimes preceded by migratory arthralgias); <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> certain rare neurologic problems, primarily a subtle encephalopathy or polyneuropathy. Late Lyme disease may develop months to a few years after the initial infection. Arthritis may be the presenting manifestation of the disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PROPHYLAXIS FOR TICK BITE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic prophylaxis following a tick bite by an <em>Ixodes</em> tick is indicated in some cases. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of a tick bite for possible Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Efficacy and rationale'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Erythema migrans is the primary manifestation of early (also called early localized) Lyme disease. It usually occurs a few days to one month following an <em>Ixodes</em> tick bite.</p><p>Erythema migrans may be accompanied by fever and regional lymphadenopathy (each present in a minority of patients) and a variety of more subjective symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, lethargy, headache, neck stiffness, myalgias, and arthralgias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72018\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72018 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-lyme-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These influenza-like signs and symptoms infrequently occur in the absence of erythema migrans. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Early localized disease'</a>.)</p><p>Spirochetal dissemination often occurs during the first days or weeks of infection while the initial erythema migrans lesion is still present. This may result in multiple erythema migrans lesions. Unless the patient also has objective findings suggesting neurologic or cardiac involvement, the treatment is the same as that for patients with a single lesion. The goal of therapy is to shorten the duration of the signs and symptoms of early disease and to reduce the risk of development of late Lyme disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of randomized trials have demonstrated the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy in patients with erythema migrans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-lyme-disease/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>]. Different antibiotic regimens were used in these trials, and the criteria used to define treatment success and failure varied.</p><p>The following observations illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective trial, 72 adults with erythema migrans were randomly assigned to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=probenecid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">probenecid</a> (500 mg three times daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (100 mg twice daily) each for 21 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-lyme-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Both regimens were equally effective, and none of the patients experienced progression of disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized multicenter trial of 232 patients with erythema migrans compared treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefuroxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefuroxime</a> axetil (500 mg twice daily) to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (100 mg three times daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-lyme-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Each regimen was given for 20 days and both were equally effective (clinical success in 90 versus 95 percent, respectively). Similar efficacy was noted in another randomized trial comparing these drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-lyme-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The only major complication at one month post-treatment was Lyme arthritis in one patient who was treated with cefuroxime axetil; there were no other cases of Lyme arthritis at later follow-up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized multicenter trial of 246 adult patients with erythema migrans found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> (500 mg three times daily for 20 days) was superior to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> (500 mg once daily for seven days) in producing complete resolution of signs and symptoms of infection at the end of therapy (88 versus 76 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-lyme-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial from Europe of 88 patients with erythema migrans showed that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> (500 mg twice daily on day 1, followed by 500 mg daily for four days) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (100 mg twice daily for 14 days) resulted in similar outcomes (96 versus 83 percent clinical success, respectively, which was a non-significant difference) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-lyme-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Erythema migrans in Europe is usually caused by <em>B. afzelii</em>, which does not usually disseminate. Therefore, doxycycline and azithromycin may give equivalent results in that setting. However, in the United States, strains of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> usually do disseminate. In studies done in the United States, azithromycin was not as effective as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> (and therefore presumably not as effective as doxycycline) in the treatment of early Lyme disease with hematogenous dissemination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-lyme-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with early disseminated disease, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> is as effective as intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>. This was illustrated in an open-label controlled trial of 140 patients with early disseminated Lyme disease without meningitis who were randomly assigned to oral doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 21 days) or ceftriaxone (2 g once daily intravenously or intramuscularly for 14 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-lyme-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Disseminated disease was considered present if the patient had at least one of the following findings: more than one erythema migrans lesion, carditis manifested by heart block, neurologic abnormalities (facial nerve palsy or radiculitis of less than three months' duration), and acute large joint arthritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The rate of clinical cure was the same in both groups (88 and 85 percent, respectively), while treatment failure occurred in one patient in each group. Persistent symptoms at the last follow-up, usually mild arthralgias, were less common with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> (14 versus 27 percent), but this difference was not statistically significant.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of antimicrobial agent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon the results of the above trials, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefuroxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefuroxime</a> axetil have equivalent efficacy for the treatment of early Lyme disease. We recommend treatment with one of these drugs in patients with erythema migrans. Doxycycline is often used because it is effective in treating a potential coinfecting agent, <em>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</em>. Of the oral agents commonly used to treat Lyme disease, doxycycline has the best penetration into the central nervous system. Doxycycline is <strong>not</strong> recommended for children under the age of eight years or for pregnant or lactating women. However, a single treatment course of doxycycline may be given to children younger than eight years in whom the alternate agents are contraindicated.</p><p>In the United States, macrolides (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>) are <strong>not</strong> recommended as first-line therapy for erythema migrans because they are less effective than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-lyme-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and presumably the other first-line drugs. Some strains of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> exhibit resistance to macrolides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-lyme-disease/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Macrolides should be reserved for the minority of patients who are intolerant of amoxicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefuroxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefuroxime</a> axetil (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59949\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59949 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-lyme-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Early studies with macrolides used only short (5 to 7 days) courses of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-lyme-disease/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]. It is unknown whether longer courses (14 to 21 days) are as effective as other therapies. Patients treated with a macrolide should be followed closely for evidence of an inadequate response such as persistent objective findings of Lyme disease, relapse after apparent clinical response, or evolution into a later stage of Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-lyme-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>First-generation cephalosporins (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cephalexin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cephalexin</a>) are <strong>not</strong> effective for Lyme disease and should not be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-lyme-disease/abstract/2,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14,15</a>]. In some cases, erythema migrans may be confused with cellulitis. When this occurs in a Lyme-endemic area, it is appropriate to treat a skin rash with an antibiotic that will treat both cellulitis pathogens and Lyme disease (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefuroxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefuroxime</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Possible coinfection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with Lyme disease in endemic areas may be coinfected with the other infections transmitted by <em>Ixodes</em> ticks: <em>A. phagocytophilum</em>, which causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis (previously called human granulocytic ehrlichiosis), and <em>Babesia microti</em> in the United States; and tick-borne encephalitis virus in Europe. In different studies of patients with Lyme disease in the United States, the reported prevalence of coinfection has ranged from 4 to 28 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Coinfection with other tick-borne pathogens'</a>.)</p><p>Among the three drugs used for erythema migrans, only <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> is effective against <em>A. phagocytophilum</em>, which causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA, previously called human granulocytic ehrlichiosis). Thus, in patients infected in areas endemic for both Lyme disease and HGA, we suggest treatment with doxycycline. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>None of the antibiotics used for Lyme disease is effective in the treatment of <em>B. microti</em> or tick-borne encephalitis virus.

However, other trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> have shown that 10 to 14 days of therapy is as effective as more prolonged therapy in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-lyme-disease/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>].</p><p>For erythema migrans in the United States, the best data about the relationship between treatment duration and efficacy come from a randomized double-blind trial in which 180 patients with erythema migrans were assigned to one of three treatment groups: 10 days of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>; one dose of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> followed by 10 days of doxycycline; or 20 days of doxycycline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-lyme-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Efficacy was assessed at 20 days and at 3, 12, and 30 months. There was no significant difference in outcome among the groups at any of the follow-up time points. One of 61 patients who received 10 days of doxycycline developed Lyme meningitis at day 18 and was successfully treated with two weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone.</p><p>Duration of therapy for erythema migrans has also been evaluated in Europe, where most cases of erythema migrans are caused by <em>B. afzelii</em>, which does not usually disseminate (in contrast to <em>B. burgdorferi</em> infection in the United States). A trial evaluated the efficacy of 10 versus 15 days of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> in 225 patients in Slovenia who had a single erythema migrans lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-lyme-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Twelve months after enrollment, 85 of 91 patients (93 percent) who received 15 days of therapy had a complete response without sequelae, compared with 79 of 86 patients (91 percent) who received 10 days of therapy. At six months, the frequency of non-specific symptoms was similar in the two groups. These results show that for patients in Europe with a solitary erythema migrans lesion, a 10 day regimen of oral doxycycline is non-inferior to a 15 day regimen. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In keeping with the 2006 Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines, we recommend treatment of patients with erythema migrans with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefuroxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefuroxime</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-lyme-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The main argument for treating asymptomatic seropositive patients is that some patients with late manifestations of Lyme disease have no history of prior features of the disease.
