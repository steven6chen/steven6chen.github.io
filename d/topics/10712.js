Orthostatic hypotension can cause dizziness, syncope, and even angina or stroke. </p><p>Symptomatic falls in blood pressure after standing or eating are a frequent clinical problem. The prevalence of orthostatic hypotension varies from 5 to 20 percent in different reports. Many disorders can cause orthostatic hypotension, which can also be a symptom of acute or chronic volume depletion as well as a side effect of drugs, particularly antihypertensives. A related problem, postprandial hypotension (a fall in blood pressure occurring 15 to 90 minutes after meals) is also common in older subjects. </p><p>Chronic orthostatic intolerance describes the association of lightheadedness, dizziness, faintness, or syncope that occurs with prolonged standing or upright posture. These symptoms may be sometimes associated with an exaggerated tachycardia but little or no fall in blood pressure, a disorder that is called the postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS).</p><p>This topic will review the pathogenesis and causes of orthostatic and postprandial hypotension. The treatment of these syndromes is discussed separately. POTS is also discussed separately (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-orthostatic-and-postprandial-hypotension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of orthostatic and postprandial hypotension&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postural-tachycardia-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postural tachycardia syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6612869\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL BLOOD PRESSURE RESPONSE TO STANDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assumption of the upright posture results in the pooling of 500 to 1000 mL of blood in the lower extremities and splanchnic circulation, which initiates the following sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-evaluation-of-orthostatic-hypotension/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A rapid decrease in venous return to the heart</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ensuing reduction in ventricular filling results in diminished cardiac output and blood pressure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fall in blood pressure and thoracic volume provokes a compensatory reflex involving the central and peripheral nervous systems that increases sympathetic and reduces parasympathetic outflow (ie, baroreceptor reflex).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increase in sympathetic outflow raises peripheral vascular resistance, venous return, and cardiac output, thereby limiting the fall in blood pressure.</p><p/><p>Because of these compensatory mechanisms, normally, assumption of the erect posture leads to a small fall in systolic blood pressure (5 to 10 mmHg), an increase in diastolic blood pressure (5 to 10 mmHg) and an increase in pulse rate (10 to 25 beats per minute).</p><p>In patients with orthostatic hypotension, one or more of these compensatory mechanisms fails, leading to a decline in blood pressure with assumption of upright posture.

Epidemiologic surveys have found postural hypotension in as many as 20 percent of patients over age 65 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-evaluation-of-orthostatic-hypotension/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. In the Cardiovascular Health study, for example, the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension was 18 percent in subjects age 65 years or older, although only 2 percent were symptomatic (defined as dizziness with standing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-evaluation-of-orthostatic-hypotension/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There was a modest association (odds ratio 1.4 to 1.9) with systolic hypertension when supine, carotid stenosis greater than 50 percent, and the use of oral hypoglycemic agents. There was only a weak association with the use of beta blockers and no association with other antihypertensive drugs (including diuretics).</p><p>However, other studies have found the use of antihypertensive medications to be related to postural hypotension in the elderly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-evaluation-of-orthostatic-hypotension/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. Other drugs associated with postural hypotension, especially in the elderly, are vasodilators, including nitrates and calcium channel blockers, antidepressants (tricyclics and phenothiazines), opiates, and alcohol (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F89955\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89955 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Orthostatic hypotension is a common reason for, or contributor to, hospitalization in elderly patients. A report from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample estimated an orthostatic hypotension hospitalization rate of 233 per 100,000 patients over 75 years of age, with a median length of stay of three days and an overall in-hospital mortality rate of 0.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-evaluation-of-orthostatic-hypotension/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Among various inpatient series, the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in elderly patients is as high as 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-evaluation-of-orthostatic-hypotension/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p>Orthostatic hypotension can also occur in younger and middle-age subjects, who, in the absence of volume depletion (due to diuretics, hemorrhage or vomiting), usually have chronic autonomic failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many disorders can cause postural hypotension, with the two major mechanisms being autonomic failure (which can be caused by multiple disorders) and volume depletion. In addition, reflex syncope (also referred to as vasovagal or neurally mediated syncope) causes acute postural hypotension due to a transient, paroxysmal dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-evaluation-of-orthostatic-hypotension/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

Patients with severe intravascular volume depletion may experience orthostatic hypotension despite normal autonomic reflexes.</p><p>The relative frequencies of various causes of orthostatic hypotension vary according to the setting. Up to forty percent of patients have no definite cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-causes-and-evaluation-of-orthostatic-hypotension/abstract/3,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15</a>].

Subnormal norepinephrine release results in impaired vasoconstriction and reduced intrathoracic vascular volume, both of which contribute to orthostatic hypotension. The absence of an appropriate reflex-induced increase in heart rate as the blood pressure falls is a useful clinical clue to the presence of autonomic failure; however the presence of a heart rate increase does not exclude autonomic failure. (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F56293\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56293 \">figure 1</a>).

The absence of an appropriate reflex-induced increase in heart rate as the blood pressure falls is a useful clinical clue to the presence of autonomic failure; however the presence of a heart rate increase does not exclude autonomic failure. An increase in heart rate of &gt;30 bpm suggests postural tachycardia syndrome, which usually does not include orthostatic hypotension.

However, normal nerve conduction studies do not exclude a small-fiber neuropathy, which is associated with autonomic dysfunction.

Detailed autonomic testing is not widely available but can be useful in documenting an underlying dysautonomia and establishing prognosis. Regardless of the cause, treatment of orthostatic hypotension is symptomatic.
