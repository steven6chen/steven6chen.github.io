The burden of disease related to PFDs is substantial. These disorders affect one-third of adult women in the United States, with considerable impact on their quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. As many as 20 percent of women undergo surgical treatment for PFDs and approximately 17 percent of these women require reoperation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. The scope of this clinical issue is even greater than the surgical treatment rate suggests, because many women are managed conservatively with pessaries, pads, or no therapy. </p><p>An area of intense investigation is the effect of pregnancy and childbirth on a woman's risk of developing PFDs and whether this risk can be reduced by modifications to obstetric care. Some women have requested cesarean delivery for this reason. </p><p>This review will focus on urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The data are more comprehensive for incontinence, because prolapse is difficult to study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Many women with prolapse are asymptomatic and measurement of the true prolapse rate requires pelvic examination. Measurement of symptomatic prolapse is more clinically relevant, since asymptomatic prolapse does not require treatment. Even this presents a research challenge because prolapse symptoms may take longer to develop than symptoms of incontinence and the symptoms (eg, vaginal bulge or pressure, urinary retention, constipation) are less specific. Thus, even symptomatic prolapse is not well measured by symptom questionnaires [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Further, use of surgery as a surrogate measure for the prevalence of prolapse does not detect the number of women with symptomatic prolapse who have not had surgical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. </p><p>The association of urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse with pregnancy and childbirth and selected management issues are reviewed here. The role of pregnancy and childbirth in the development of fecal incontinence is discussed separately.

The urethral and anal sphincter muscles are also part of the pelvic floor.</p><p>The endopelvic connective tissues lie superior to the pelvic floor muscles and connect to the pelvic side walls and sacrum. The perineal membrane (ie, bulbocavernosus, transverse perineal, and ischiocavernosus muscles) lies external and inferior to the pelvic floor.</p><p>The innervation of this region is from the S2, S3, and S4 segments of the spinal cord, which fuse to form the pudendal nerve. The pudendal nerve innervates the external anal sphincter, whereas the levators, coccygeus muscles, and urogenital diaphragm appear to be innervated by a direct connection of S2, S3, and S4 nerve fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Female pelvic floor anatomy is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-female-urogenital-anatomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical female urogenital anatomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3161340\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of pregnancy and childbirth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The biologic mechanisms of injury to the pelvic floor during pregnancy and childbirth have not been fully determined. Data suggest that pregnancy and delivery contribute to pelvic floor injury due to compression, stretching, or tearing of nerve, muscle, and connective tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61738\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61738 \">figure 1</a>). Intact neuromuscular function and pelvic organ support are both critical to normal function of pelvic viscera. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3161346\"><span class=\"h3\">Neural injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During labor and vaginal delivery, descent of the fetal head may cause stretching and compression of the pelvic floor and the associated nerves. This process can lead to demyelination and subsequent denervation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This mechanism of injury is supported by neurophysiologic tests, including concentric needle electromyography (EMG) and pudendal nerve motor latency, which have demonstrated denervation of the pubovisceral muscles and anal sphincter after 40 to 80 percent of vaginal births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Risk factors for denervation and pudendal nerve damage include operative delivery, prolonged second stage, and high birth weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In vivo research on pudendal neuropathy after childbirth is challenging because electrophysiologic testing is technically complex, invasive, and difficult to interpret. Thus, most studies of pelvic floor denervation after childbirth are limited to small samples; conflicting results have been obtained. Some insights have been derived from animal models of pudendal nerve injury. In some cases, vaginal balloon distension has been used to simulate pudendal nerve compression by the fetal head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Other models include crush injuries or transection of the pudendal nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Pelvic pressure by the fetal head during the second stage of labor may lead to combined neurovascular injury<sup> </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In animal models, direct and indirect pudendal injury has been shown to result in stress incontinence<sup> </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The resultant stress incontinence persists if the pudendal nerve is completely transected, but resolves after distension injury. Recovery after vaginal distension is delayed among animals subjected to both pudendal crush and vaginal distension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Thus, it is not clear whether these animal models are relevant to childbirth injuries in humans.</p><p>Cohort studies suggest that neuromuscular injury resolves during the first year after delivery for the majority of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This may account for the spontaneous resolution of incontinence over that same period. However, in some cases, electrophysiologic evidence of denervation injury can be seen five to six years after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/16,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,22</a>], and denervation injury may accumulate with increasing parity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/14,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23,24</a>]. It is not known why some women recover neuromuscular function after childbirth and others demonstrate evidence of permanent damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3161352\"><span class=\"h3\">Injury to the levator ani and coccygeus muscles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The levator ani muscle complex is critical to pelvic floor function.<strong> </strong>This muscle complex forms a U-shaped sling around the pelvic viscera.<strong> </strong>The resting tone of the levator ani muscle keeps the urogenital hiatus closed, resisting the downward displacement of the vagina during increased intraabdominal pressure. Voluntary levator ani contraction can further augment vaginal closure force, leading to compression of rectum, distal vagina, and urethra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Loss of levator function (eg, due to traumatic disruption, denervation, or atrophy) may lead to widening of the urogenital hiatus and result in pelvic organ descent.</p><p>Magnetic resonance (MR) and ultrasound studies have provided important observations regarding the levator ani muscle after childbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Evidence suggests that the levator may be avulsed from the pubic bone with vaginal delivery. Specifically, distension of the pubococcygeus by the fetal head may result in detachment of the levator muscle from the pubis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Levator avulsion has been observed among 20 percent of women who have delivered vaginally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], but only rarely after cesarean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Imaging studies suggest that forceps delivery further increases risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. For example, one study reported that the odds of levator avulsion was almost fivefold higher after forceps-assisted delivery compared with vacuum-assisted birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Prolonged second stage of labor may also be associated with occult injury to the levator ani [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/26,29,31,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29,31,33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=operative-vaginal-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Operative vaginal delivery&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Computer simulation models have supported the hypothesis that levator injury leads to prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Finite element models have been used to model deformations of the pelvic floor with vaginal delivery. Using this theoretical approach, a model predicted that the greatest strain would occur at the bony attachments of the levator ani and pubococcygeus muscles, presumably with extension of the fetal head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The degree of deformation predicted would exceed thresholds for injury, especially in the most medial aspects of the levator ani complex. Similar results were obtained with a three-dimensional (3-D) computer model of birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Correlation with anatomic studies of parous women is needed to assess the validity of these simulation models.</p><p>The implications of levator avulsion are currently under investigation. Women who have levator avulsion injuries on MR imaging have weaker pelvic floor muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Among populations of women seeking prolapse treatment, the prevalence of levator avulsion was 36 percent in an Australian population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] and 55 percent in a United States population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Levator avulsions are twice as common among women with prolapse compared with controls. Thus, occult levator avulsion may be a mechanism for the development of prolapse in many, but certainly not all, cases. The incidence of occult levator trauma among vaginally parous women presenting for treatment of incontinence may be as high as 24 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], although it is unclear whether levator avulsion is more prevalent in women with incontinence than among other parous women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/29,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,37</a>]. Thus, levator avulsion may not be a risk factor for stress urinary incontinence. These observations suggest that occult injuries to the levator ani muscles during labor and delivery may account for some cases of pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) after childbirth.</p><p>Pelvic floor muscle strength is decreased after vaginal delivery compared with women who had only cesarean deliveries. As an example, in a prospective cohort study of 666 women followed for 6 to 11 years, pelvic floor muscle strength was lower in women who had a vaginal delivery rather than a cesarean delivery; the lowest strength was in women who had a forceps delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>Mediolateral episiotomy, which typically involves an intentional incision of the levator ani and coccygeus muscles, is an example of overt trauma to the pelvic floor during delivery. As expected, mediolateral episiotomy is associated with a substantial decline in pelvic floor strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. However, there is no evidence that the risk of PFDs is increased by mediolateral episiotomy. This was illustrated by a study that evaluated 519 primiparous women three months from delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Compared to women with an intact perineum and first- and second-degree spontaneous perineal lacerations, women who had undergone mediolateral episiotomy were no more likely to experience urinary incontinence, anal incontinence, anterior vaginal wall prolapse, apical prolapse, or posterior wall prolapse.</p><p>There are no proven treatments for women who sustain levator injury with delivery. As an example, a small study of postpartum women found that those with and without levator avulsion (demonstrated on ultrasound) have a similar response to postpartum pelvic muscle exercises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Also, it is not currently the standard of care to assess for levator injury in the postpartum period. Until effective secondary prevention measures are identified, assessment for obstetrical levator injury does not have clinical value.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3162047\"><span class=\"h3\">Fascial injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injury to other soft tissue structures may provide another mechanism by which childbirth may lead to PFDs, especially pelvic organ prolapse. One study described paravaginal defects as separation of the endopelvic fascia from its lateral attachment to pelvic side wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Paravaginal defects are associated with urethral hypermobility, stress urinary incontinence, and poor anterior vaginal support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3161364\"><span class=\"h3\">Impaired connective tissue remodeling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Collagen and elastin are the two primary components of extracellular matrix. Elastin contributes to distensibility, while collagen is associated with tensile strength. During pregnancy, increased synthesis of collagen and elastin contributes to changes in soft tissue biomechanics. Most notably, the vagina becomes more distensible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Distension or stretching of the vagina promotes the release of collagenases from fibroblasts, leading to increased collagen degradation. </p><p>After delivery, there is an increase in synthesis of collagen and elastin, leading to substantial remodeling of pelvic floor and vaginal connective tissue. Defects in these biochemical processes have been postulated as a possible mechanism for development of PFDs. Genetic defects in connective tissue metabolism have been hypothesized as a mechanism for susceptibility to prolapse. Impaired elastin synthesis in animal models contributes to prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Alterations in collagen composition have been demonstrated in women with prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Also, vaginal tissue from women with stress urinary incontinence has demonstrated differential expression of genes related to elastin metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, in women with established prolapse, it is impossible to know whether the observed connective tissue properties are the cause of prolapse or a response to the vaginal wall distension associated with prolapse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE IN PAROUS WOMEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A causal role of pregnancy and childbirth is supported by the finding that pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) are more prevalent among women who have delivered at least one child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/48-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-60</a>]. Furthermore, the rate of PFDs increases with increasing parity. Among parous women, it has been estimated that 50 percent of incontinence and 75 percent of prolapse can be attributed to pregnancy and childbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. </p><p>The effect of parity is prominent mainly in premenopausal women. Age is also a risk factor for PFDs and, in postmenopausal women, the impact of age appears to override the impact of parity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>].</p><p>In nulligravid women less than age 55 years, the prevalence of urinary incontinence is 6.5 to 18 percent and of prolapse is approximately 0.6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/51,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,64,65</a>].

Clinical trials are challenging in this area of obstetrics and, therefore, most of the data are derived from observational studies. In addition, it is difficult to individually assess a particular intervention because obstetric characteristics may cluster (eg, episiotomy is associated with forceps delivery), making it difficult to assess the impact of any individual modification. Also, it is likely that our current practices regarding clinical documentation of labor and delivery do not adequately describe obstetric &quot;exposures&quot; across a population (eg, how low did the presenting fetal part descend?, what was the position of the mother and fetus during the second stage?, did her symptoms progress or regress?, and how long was she followed postpartum?).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4189329\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylactic pelvic floor muscle exercises</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic floor muscle exercises (PFME) performed during pregnancy help to decrease the short-term risk of urinary incontinence in women without prior incontinence, but a long-term benefit has not been established. This was illustrated in a meta-analysis that included six randomized trials that found that continent women (most trials included only nulliparous women) who were assigned to perform antenatal PFME compared with those who were not had a significantly decreased risk of urinary incontinence at three to six months postpartum (18 versus 25 percent; risk ratio 0.71, 95% CI 0.54-0.95) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].

This continued as a trend through 12 months postpartum, but did not reach statistical significance. It is important to note that study of a mixed population of continent and incontinent women results in study of use of PFME as both prophylaxis and treatment, so it is difficult to interpret the results. </p><p>In terms of postpartum PFME, there is increasing evidence that some women sustain injury to the levator ani muscle complex at childbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/106,107\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,107</a>].&nbsp;If this is true, PFME in the immediate postpartum period may be harmful to some women because an exercise program may be contraindicated in the early phase of injury recovery.

While cesarean delivery has been associated with a lower risk of PFDs compared with vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery does not eliminate the risk of a future PFD. Thus, for this and other reasons, we suggest not performing cesarean delivery for non-obstetric indications; this is referred to as elective cesarean, patient choice cesarean, or maternal request cesarean. Antepartum maternal characteristics are poor predictors of pelvic floor disorders. At this point, there are no maternal characteristics that can be used to reliably guide specific women to the option of planned cesarean delivery. This recommendation is consistent with guidelines from the American College of Obstetrician and Gynecologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p>There have been no randomized trials that specifically address the potential value of elective cesarean delivery to reduce the risk of PFDs. However, some insights can be gleaned from a randomized trial of women (n = 1159) with term breech fetuses who were assigned to planned cesarean or planned vaginal birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. At two-year follow-up, an intent-to-treat analysis found that the rate of urinary incontinence did not differ significantly in the cesarean and vaginal delivery groups (17.8 versus 21.8 percent; relative risk 0.81, 95% CI 0.61-1.1); pelvic organ prolapse was not evaluated. However, many participants were multiparous, and had already delivered vaginally. Also, almost 50 percent of women assigned to the planned vaginal delivery group delivered by cesarean. Both of these factors limit the ability of the study to predict whether cesarean delivery only can prevent PFDs. &#160;</p><p>Some studies have calculated that 7 to 12 women would have to deliver only by cesarean to prevent one woman from having a PFD later in life, assuming that the observed associations are causal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/1,94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,94,95</a>]. A 2006 United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) expert panel concluded that there is only weak evidence to support a preventative role for elective cesarean delivery, and that the existing data do not adequately answer the question of whether elective cesarean delivery can reduce the incidence of PFDs. Even if a reduction in PFDs could be demonstrated, other harms and benefits of elective cesarean delivery need to be weighed against this benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>].

Thus, there is insufficient evidence to establish whether an episiotomy or operative delivery is the cause of postpartum incontinence or simply a marker for a more difficult birth. The risks of performing these procedures should be weighed against the potential benefits in specific clinical situations. </p><p>The question has been raised regarding whether vacuum delivery should be used rather than forceps, as a measure to decrease the risk of PFDs. A variety of endpoints, including neonatal morbidity, should be considered in the decision to perform either vacuum or forceps delivery. If both are felt to be safe and viable options, the existing evidence suggests that pelvic floor disorders are more strongly associated with forceps delivery.
