Issues related to types of bacteremia, indications, and technique for blood cultures will be reviewed here. Issues related to specimen transport and Gram stain interpretation are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-specimen-collection-and-transport\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology specimen collection and transport&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-gram-stain-and-culture-results-in-the-microbiology-laboratory\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to Gram stain and culture results in the microbiology laboratory&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR CULTURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood cultures should be obtained (<strong>prior</strong> to initiation of antimicrobial therapy) for any patient in whom there is suspicion of bacteremia or fungemia, including hospitalized patients and selected outpatients with fever and leukocytosis or leukopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, a normal white blood cell count does not rule out bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Circumstances in which blood cultures are especially important include known or suspected sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, arthritis, endocarditis, peritonitis, pneumonia, and fever of unknown origin.</p><p>Indications for follow-up blood cultures are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H11455815\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up blood cultures'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">METHOD FOR OBTAINING CULTURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, adult patients with bacteremia are likely to have low quantities of bacteria in the blood, even in the setting of sepsis. In addition, bacteremia in adults is generally intermittent. For this reason, multiple blood cultures, each containing large volumes of blood, are required to detect bacteremia. Prior to initiation of antimicrobial therapy, at least two sets of blood cultures taken from separate venipuncture sites should be obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The technique, number of cultures, and volume of blood are more important factors for detection of bacteremia than timing of culture collection; these are discussed further in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Careful technique is critical to avoid contamination of the blood culture media by normal skin flora during the process of collection. This is important because normal bacterial skin flora can also cause systemic disease, such as infective endocarditis, and in some circumstances blood culture contamination can make it difficult to distinguish between false-positive results and true infection. Measures to reduce contamination include effective disinfection of the venipuncture site and avoiding blood culture collection through existing intravenous lines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>].</p><p>A tourniquet should be applied and the vein palpated <strong>before</strong> disinfection of the venipuncture site. Thereafter, the venipuncture site should be cleansed with 70 percent alcohol followed by 2 percent tincture of iodine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/5-8,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8,10,11</a>]. The disinfectant should be allowed to dry before blood is aspirated. If further palpation of the vein is necessary after skin preparation, a sterile glove should be worn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Alcohol should be used to disinfect the septa of culture bottles after removing their caps. Blood should be collected directly into culture bottles during the venipuncture procedure, rather than into tubes sent to the laboratory for subsequent transfer into the culture bottles.</p><p>Lower contamination rates have been observed with iodine tincture and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> than with povidone-iodine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. A randomized trial comparing iodine tincture with povidone-iodine in over 3800 blood cultures obtained from adult inpatients reported a lower contamination rate with iodine tincture (2.4 versus 3.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A randomized trial comparing chlorhexidine with povidone-iodine in over 2000 blood cultures reported a lower contamination rate with chlorhexidine (1.4 versus 3.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Blood cultures should not be drawn through an intravenous catheter at the time of catheter insertion. In an observational study of over 4100 blood cultures obtained for evaluation of children with suspected bacteremia, the false-positive rate was higher for specimens obtained at the time of catheter insertion than for specimens obtained from a separate site (9.1 versus 2.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Drawing blood for cultures through an indwelling intravascular catheter should be avoided whenever possible, since ports are frequently colonized with skin flora, thereby increasing the likelihood of a false-positive blood culture. If blood cultures are drawn from an intravenous line, a second specimen should be drawn from a peripheral venipuncture site. In one center, implementation of an institutional policy discouraging collection of blood for culture from indwelling vascular catheters was associated with a reduction in blood culture contamination rates from 1.6 to 0.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, venipuncture blood cultures were collected only by trained phlebotomists or members of the hospital&rsquo;s intravenous team following receipt of specific training in the use of proper aseptic technique for drawing blood cultures.</p><p>For circumstances in which intravascular catheter-related infection is suspected, the approach to blood culture collection and diagnostic criteria are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-intravascular-catheter-related-infections#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of intravascular catheter-related infections&quot;, section on 'Blood cultures'</a>.)</p><p>Arterial blood cultures provide the same yield as venous blood cultures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Number of cultures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal number of blood cultures that should be obtained varies with the clinical condition, suspicion for underlying infection (eg, the pretest probability), and the urgency of the need for treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, the number of cultures obtained depends on the volume of blood drawn for each culture set. A set consists of one aerobic bottle and one anaerobic bottle. Among 134 patients in one study, the yield from two blood cultures (30 mL in each of two bottles) was the same as the yield from three blood cultures (20 mL in each of three bottles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In two other studies evaluating yield for four or more blood cultures (volume 20 mL), the cumulative yield of true pathogens increased with the first (73 to 80 percent), second (80 to 89 percent), third (95 to 98 percent), and fourth (99 to 100 percent) cultures collected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>].</p><p>One blood culture set is rarely advisable or sufficient. A positive single culture result may not be interpretable unless an unequivocal pathogen is isolated. If a possible contaminant is reported on a single culture, additional culture data are needed, and in the interim, unnecessary antimicrobial therapy or unnecessary testing may be pursued. Moreover, a single blood culture lacks sensitivity as well as precludes the ability to distinguish contaminants from true bacteremia with bacteria that are common contaminants such as coagulase-negative staphylococci and diphtheroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>A total of two blood culture sets is usually adequate when a continuous bacteremia is suspected and the pretest probability of bacteremia is high (as in patients with suspected infective endocarditis who have not received prior antimicrobial therapy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected native valve endocarditis&quot;, section on 'Blood cultures'</a>.)</p><p>A total of three blood culture sets is appropriate for circumstances in which bacteremia due to a pathogen not likely to be a contaminant is anticipated (as in intraabdominal sepsis or pneumonia) and when the pretest probability of bacteremia is low to moderate. The first two blood cultures, obtained with separate venipunctures, can be obtained in sequence. The third blood culture should be obtained four to six hours later.</p><p>A total of four blood culture sets is reasonable when the pretest probability of bacteremia is high and the anticipated pathogen is likely to be a common contaminant, such coagulase-negative staphylococci. Clinical examples include prosthetic valve endocarditis or endovascular infections due to infected devices, such as pacemakers or grafts. As many as four blood culture sets may also be necessary to diagnose endocarditis in patients who have received antimicrobial therapy in the preceding two weeks.</p><p>Additional blood cultures are rarely useful in patients who have been evaluated by the above criteria unless there has been a significant change in the patient's condition or a new focus of infection is suspected. Furthermore, the likelihood of obtaining a false-positive test (ie, a positive blood culture due to a contaminant) increases as more blood cultures are obtained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Volume of blood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal volume for each blood culture in adults is 20 mL (10 mL introduced into an aerobic bottle and 10 mL introduced into an anaerobic bottle); the appropriate volumes for children are summarized in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55558\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55558 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-24</a>].</p><p>The blood culture yield depends on the volume of blood cultured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/19,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,25,26</a>]. One study comparing 829 matched pairs of standard volume (mean 8.7 mL) and low volume (mean 2.7 mL) blood cultures demonstrated that bottles inoculated with at least 5 mL of blood had a significantly higher detection rate for bacteremia than bottles inoculated with less than 5 mL (92 versus 69 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The authors estimated that the yield of blood cultures in adults increases approximately 3 percent per mL of blood cultured.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fever at the time of blood culture collection is neither sensitive nor specific for the presence of bacteremia. In a retrospective study evaluating the timing of blood culture collection in relation to temperature elevations in over 1400 patients with bacteremia and fungemia, no relationship was observed between timing of specimen collection and likelihood of a positive blood culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>There is no difference in yield whether blood samples for culture are drawn simultaneously or at intervals spaced within a 24-hour period. For patients who are acutely ill or have high likelihood of continuous bacteremia, it is acceptable to obtain blood cultures from two separate sites within minutes of one another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Blood cultures should be obtained prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CULTURE MEDIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Special culture media may be helpful in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of blood culture bottles containing media with resins, lytic agents, or other neutralizing substances may be useful for documenting bacteremia in patients receiving antimicrobial therapy at the time blood cultures are obtained.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Filamentous and dimorphic fungi, especially <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>, are best detected from blood with the centrifugation-lysis (Isolator) system, which is also useful in the detection of <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> and <em>M. tuberculosis</em>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Special broth media (BACTEC) are also available for the detection of mycobacteria species.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1396200\"><span class=\"h1\">DURATION OF INCUBATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most clinically significant bacteremias are detected within 48 hours with use of instrument-based continuous monitoring blood culture systems.

Both common and fastidious pathogens (such as members of the HACEK group) may be detected within five days of incubation with modern automated blood culture detection systems; extended incubation beyond this time frame is generally not necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12234487\"><span class=\"h1\">ORGANISM IDENTIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional methods for organism identification utilize physical characteristics and biochemical reactions to establish an organism's metabolic profile, which subsequently can be compared with an established database of profiles. Most automated systems rely on indicators including pH changes, enzymatic reactions, indicators of metabolic activity in the presence of a variety of carbon sources, detection of volatile or nonvolatile acids, and recognition of visible growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Relatively new technologies for organism identification include molecular methods, matrix-assisted laser <span class=\"nowrap\">desorption/ionization</span> time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and next-generation sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Techniques for rapid identification of bacteria and yeast directly from blood cultures include MALDI-TOF MS and multiplexed molecular tests; the clinical utility and cost effectiveness of these tools have yet to be established. In one randomized trial including 617 patients with positive blood cultures randomized to standard blood culture processing with MALDI-TOF MS, rapid multiplex polymerase chain reaction (rmPCR) with templated interpretation comments, and rmPCR with templated comments in addition to real-time antimicrobial stewardship, rmPCR with templated comments reduced treatment of contaminants and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics; addition of antimicrobial stewardship enhanced antimicrobial deescalation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERPRETING POSITIVE CULTURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4828398\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of bacteremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two clinical patterns of bacteremia, intermittent and continuous:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermittent bacteremia implies that bacteria are present in the blood for periods of time followed by nonbacteremic periods; this is the most common pattern of bacteremia. It can occur following manipulation of infected tissues (such as surgical abscess drainage), following instrumentation of contaminated mucosal surfaces (such as dental procedures, cystoscopy, or sigmoidoscopy), or in the setting of bacterial infections (such as pneumonia, arthritis, osteomyelitis, soft tissue infection, and meningitis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous bacteremia usually reflects a persistent endovascular infection such as endocarditis or endarteritis, suppurative thrombophlebitis, an infected aneurysm, or infection of intravascular foreign bodies such as vascular grafts. It also occurs in the first two weeks of typhoid fever and brucellosis, although in these diseases relatively few bacteria per mL of blood are detected.</p><p/><p>There are two major categories of infection associated with bacteremia: extravascular infection and intravascular infection. Extravascular infections originate outside the bloodstream (such as pneumonia or urinary tract infection) and enter the vascular supply via the lymphatic system. Intravascular infections are associated with a primary infectious process within the bloodstream; examples include infective endocarditis, suppurative thrombophlebitis, vascular graft infections, mycotic aneurism infections, and endovascular catheter infections.</p><p>The efficiency of bacterial clearance depends on the infecting microorganism and the host immune status. For example, bacterial capsules and other virulence factors may delay clearance by decreasing opsonization, while the presence of specific antibodies may enhance clearance by promoting opsonization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4828427\"><span class=\"h2\">Contamination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contamination of blood cultures can occur even when precise techniques for collection and processing are used. Contamination rates of less than 3 percent are desirable; higher rates should be investigated and corrected with educational efforts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, group A streptococci, Enterobacteriaceae, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, Bacteroidaceae, and <em>Candida</em> species are always important clinical pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Viridans streptococci and enterococci may reflect true pathogens or contaminants.</p><p>Organisms for which it can be difficult to distinguish between clinical significance and contamination include <em>Cutibacterium</em> (formerly <em>Propionibacterium</em>)<em> acnes</em>, <em>Corynebacterium</em> species, <em>Bacillus</em> species, and coagulase-negative staphylococci; the likelihood of clinical significance is increased if the organism is observed in multiple blood cultures obtained from separate venipunctures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/4,6,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,18</a>]. In addition, the presence of these organisms in the setting of prosthetic heart valves or intravascular devices should prompt consideration of infective endocarditis.</p><p>Contamination should be suspected when bacterial growth first occurs in blood cultures after 72 hours of incubation. Exceptions in which delayed growth of true infection can occur in blood cultures include certain fastidious organisms (such as <em>Eikenella</em>, some <em>Haemophilus</em> species, <em>Kingella</em>, and <em>Cardiobacterium</em>) and bacteria that have been suppressed by antimicrobial therapy administered prior to blood culture collection.</p><p>Because of the economic and clinical ramifications of contaminated blood cultures, laboratories should have algorithms in place for assessing the clinical significance of all positive blood cultures when contamination is a possibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/blood-cultures-for-the-detection-of-bacteremia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].
