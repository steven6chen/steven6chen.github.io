In addition, splenic function is reduced in the neonate and may be abnormally reduced (ie, hyposplenism or functional asplenia) when the spleen is engorged with blood (eg, splenic sequestration crisis associated with sickle cell disease, malaria, splenic vein thrombosis), or infiltrated (eg, sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, tumors, or cysts). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-splenomegaly-and-other-splenic-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with splenomegaly and other splenic disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Asplenic patients and those with impaired splenic function are at risk for a fulminant sepsis syndrome usually due to <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>. The terms &quot;postsplenectomy sepsis&quot; and &quot;asplenic sepsis&quot; are largely interchangeable since the functional defects are the same regardless of whether the causative process is congenital or acquired. In this topic review, we will use the term &quot;asplenic sepsis&quot; to include all asplenic patients. </p><p>The prevention of sepsis will be reviewed here. The importance of the spleen for clearance of bacteria and humoral immune response, conditions leading to asplenia, clinical manifestations of infection in the asplenic patient, and management of sepsis in the asplenic patient are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and management of sepsis in the asplenic patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients must be instructed that the asplenic state carries a small risk of overwhelming and life-threatening infection. Fulminant sepsis in asplenic patients is classically caused by encapsulated organisms, particularly <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> but also <em>Haemophilus influenzae </em>and <em>Neisseria meningitidis </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Fulminant sepsis in asplenic patients has also been caused by <em>Capnocytophaga canimorsus</em>, which is almost exclusively observed after close contact with dogs (bites, scratches, or even saliva exposure). Asplenic individuals are also at risk for severe babesiosis, a tick-borne illness that is endemic in parts of the United States Northeast and upper Midwest. These and other infections in asplenic patients are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and management of sepsis in the asplenic patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is crucial that asplenic individuals adhere to the preventive measures outlined below and that they inform all caregivers of their asplenic state. The combined use of pneumococcal immunization and early administration of oral empiric antibiotic therapy for fever offers a high level of protection against sepsis in asplenic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Asplenic individuals should also be counseled about avoiding dog bites, scratches, and contact with dog saliva to prevent <em>C. canimorsus</em> infection as well as avoiding tick bites in <em>Babesia</em>-endemic regions.</p><p>Adherence to preventive measures can be improved by developing a systematic approach within a clinic or healthcare system, such as having a registry of asplenic patients, clear guidelines for vaccinations and empiric antibiotics, and a program for patient outreach and education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoid splenectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In view of the high mortality rate observed in postsplenectomy sepsis, measures that avoid splenectomy should be utilized whenever possible. Performing splenic repair instead of splenectomy during exploratory laparotomy for intraabdominal trauma or following unexpected splenic injury during intraabdominal procedures preserves functional splenic tissue and is believed to reduce the risk of overwhelming bacterial sepsis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunizations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spleen is the dominant site for the production of IgM antibodies required for opsonizing encapsulated pathogens. Thus, whenever elective splenectomy is considered, patients should undergo appropriately timed preoperative immunization against <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> (pneumococcus), <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> (meningococcus), and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b. Vaccination recommendations for asplenic patients are presented in the following Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91885\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91885 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing of immunizations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaccines should be administered at least 14 days prior to scheduled splenectomy. If indicated, multiple vaccines can be given during the same visit at different anatomic sites, although certain vaccines cannot be given together (eg, the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-conjugate-vaccine-13-valent-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine</a> [PCV13] and the 23-valent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-polysaccharide-vaccine-23-valent-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</a> [PPSV23]). Specific vaccine recommendations are discussed below. </p><p>If it is not possible to vaccinate patients preoperatively, immunizations can be given after the 14<sup>th</sup> postoperative day. This recommendation is based in part upon a study comparing pneumococcal vaccination 1, 7, and 14 days after splenectomy in 59 trauma patients compared to 12 adult controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Postvaccination immunization titers were not significantly different from control patients. However, opsonophagocytic function of the antibodies was diminished in patients vaccinated before the 14-day point. In another study, splenectomized patients who needed pneumococcal revaccination due to low antibody responses were significantly more likely to have received their initial vaccination fewer than 14 days before or after splenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>If postoperative vaccine administration is performed prior to postoperative day 14, it is reasonable to repeat the postsplenectomy vaccines eight weeks after the initial doses. In patients undergoing immunosuppressive chemotherapy or radiotherapy, immunization should be delayed for at least three months after completion of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

We do <strong>not</strong> recommend routine prophylaxis in asplenic adults. However, lifelong daily prophylaxis may be considered in survivors of an episode of pneumococcal sepsis and in highly immunocompromised individuals (eg, patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, patients with HIV infection, solid organ transplant recipients, and patients with advanced liver disease). When antibiotic prophylaxis is used in adults, the same antibiotics should be used as those recommended for children above. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amoxicillin</a> and penicillin are both given at a dose of 250 to 500 mg twice daily.
