The bleeding pattern most bothersome to women is probably unscheduled bleeding and spotting, which can occur with all hormonal methods of contraception, as well as the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=copper-intrauterine-device-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">copper intrauterine device</a> (IUD). The frequency of unscheduled bleeding is highest in the first few months of use, and then begins to diminish. Interventions that prevent or treat unscheduled bleeding could improve contraceptive acceptability and increase compliance, and thus lead to fewer unplanned pregnancies. These interventions are discussed below and summarized in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69054\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69054 \">algorithm 1</a>). They are generally in agreement with those of the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/UnintendedPregnancy/USSPR.htm&amp;token=XfFL7YtBASQy2y9XF+DCaa30UEp8SfglHbkmF7n/WHGQ85yM78/Y0h/UwGQrUZpBXyIwtrKXbxLM02W/z9ehf/54ZPgo3oYjVjp4wgo9/q8=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5474\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">United States Selected Practice Recommendations (US SPR) for Contraceptive Use</a> (2016) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F89826\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89826 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Upon initiation of the method, unscheduled bleeding is thought to be due to a relatively thick endometrium transitioning to a relatively thin endometrium as a result of the progestin-dominant component of all hormonal contraceptives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. With continuing use, it is thought to be the final step in a complex process activated by continuous exposure to exogenous sex steroids, particularly progestins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In this environment, the endometrium develops a dense network of small, thin-walled, dilated, superficial veins and capillaries, which are fragile and prone to focal bleeding. The fragility of these vessels is due to alterations in their basement membranes and pericytes, as well as reduced structural support from the endometrial stroma and glands, which are also altered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Altered matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity appears to have a major role in this remodeling. Changes in endometrial perfusion, local vascular hemostasis, pro- and anti-oxidant processes, and migratory cells also appear to play a role.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to initiating contraception, women should be thoroughly counseled about the range of bleeding patterns associated with various contraceptive options and informed that there is no evidence that unscheduled bleeding is associated with decreased contraceptive efficacy or other harmful effects. Providing this information as a component of standard contraception counseling helps patients choose the method that best suits their needs. If warned of the frequency, course, and significance of unscheduled bleeding, they may be more willing to adhere to the method if bleeding irregularities occur and can be reassured that the method is effective, thus reducing the risk of unintended pregnancy. Users of short-acting hormonal methods like oral contraceptive pills, the contraceptive patch, or the vaginal ring should understand that missed or delayed ingestion, application, or placement can lead to unscheduled withdrawal bleeding.</p><p>Even with the most effective contraceptive methods, pregnancy should be considered and excluded if a woman experiences a significant change in her bleeding pattern or if she develops pregnancy-type symptoms (breast tenderness, nausea, urinary frequency, fatigue). Both pregnancy (intrauterine and ectopic) and hormonal contraceptives share many of the same signs and symptoms. In particular, absence of uterine bleeding and unscheduled bleeding are not only signs of early pregnancy, but also common occurrences with hormonal methods of birth control, both combined and progestin-only.</p><p>In addition to a full medical history, the following questions can help guide further evaluation when a woman is experiencing unscheduled bleeding or spotting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the patient&rsquo;s main concerns?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What was her bleeding pattern prior to her current method of contraception? How has it changed?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How many days does she bleed each month, how heavy is the bleeding, and how many bleeding episodes occur?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the bleeding occur during or after sex or is it associated with pain or urinary symptoms? Bleeding associated with sex, pain, or urinary symptoms is unlikely to be related to contraception.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What drugs or medications is she taking? Some drugs may affect bleeding patterns in contraceptive users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has she been consistent in her use of contraception? Missing pills or taking them late affects hormone levels, which can cause unscheduled bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does she smoke? Smoking may affect bleeding patterns in contraceptive users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has she had a new partner or is she at increased risk of a sexually transmitted infection? Cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease can cause unscheduled bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cervicitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cervicitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When was her last cervical cancer screening?</p><p/><p>Beyond pregnancy testing, the decision to initiate a more detailed evaluation will depend on the answers to these questions and the type of contraceptive the patient is using. Unscheduled bleeding is common and expected with the use of progestin methods (contraceptive implants, progestin only pills, DMPA, and the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device [IUD]); further evaluation is not necessary unless indicated based on history (bleeding pattern was abnormal prior to contraceptive use), symptoms (menorrhagia, pain, vaginal discharge) or national cervical cancer screening guidelines, even if the unscheduled bleeding persists for the duration of contraceptive use. With the initiation of other contraceptive methods, including combined estrogen-progestin methods (pill, patch, ring) and the copper-releasing IUD, unscheduled bleeding is common and usually resolves over time, thus, further evaluation is not routinely necessary in the first six months of use.</p><p>A patient with additional symptoms, such as pelvic pain or vaginal discharge, should have a pelvic examination. Depending on the findings and her symptoms, a pelvic ultrasound may be helpful to evaluate for possible uterine pathology (eg, fibroid, polyp). Cervical cancer screening should be performed according to national screening guidelines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-cervical-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for cervical cancer&quot;</a>.) An endometrial biopsy is reasonable in women over the age of 35 who had abnormal uterine bleeding for more than three months prior to starting contraception, women with a history of endometrial hyperplasia, or women with prolonged periods of unopposed estrogen stimulation secondary to chronic anovulation. Otherwise, the decision to biopsy the endometrium for women who are experiencing unscheduled bleeding while using contraception will depend on the method they are using. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Drug therapy has been used in an attempt to prevent or treat unscheduled bleeding. Most trials have been small <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> had design flaws; thus, it is difficult to determine whether the medical therapies discussed below result in a statistically significant reduction in symptoms. Our general approach is summarized in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69054\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69054 \">algorithm 1</a>) and is generally in agreement with that of the United States Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use (2016) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F89826\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89826 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Amenorrhea related to use of hormonal contraception does not require medical treatment. Pregnancy should be excluded if clinically indicated because of abrupt onset of amenorrhea, signs and symptoms of pregnancy, or inconsistent or incorrect contraceptive use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15719109\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTROGEN-PROGESTIN CONTRACEPTIVES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15719137\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding pattern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives include oral contraceptive pills (OCs), the transdermal contraceptive patch, and the vaginal contraceptive ring.

Randomized trials have shown that unscheduled bleeding is slightly higher with the lowest dose OCs (20 mcg ethinyl estradiol [EE] component) than with 30 to 35 mcg EE pills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. There is no evidence that unscheduled bleeding is associated with decreased efficacy, even with the lowest dose products, as long as the woman takes her pills consistently (ie, no missed days and at the same time every day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Extended use involves taking hormonally active pills daily for intervals of several months, thus minimizing scheduled bleeds to only a few times per year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Compared to the traditional monthly regimen, continuous and extended use of OCs decreases the overall number of scheduled bleeding days; however, they are associated with a high frequency of unscheduled bleeding and spotting, particularly during the first three months of use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. In randomized trials, absence of all uterine bleeding and spotting during months 0 to 3 was achieved in less than 50 percent of continuous OC users, but this rate increased to 80 to 90 percent by months 10 to 12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. The duration of unscheduled bleeding appears to be higher in women using continuous OCs that contain <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> (LNG) than in those that contain <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> acetate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Unscheduled bleeding will cease by the third cycle in the majority of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If bleeding is prolonged and the woman desires intervention, experts have recommended a short course of estrogen (1.25 mg conjugated estrogen or 2 mg estradiol for seven days) to decrease the duration of the bleeding episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Supplemental estrogen can be used any time during the pill cycle. Estrogen supplementation is thought to promote tissue repair and coagulation. However, there are no studies demonstrating the benefit of this approach.</p><p>Some clinicians manage bothersome unscheduled bleeding related to OCs by switching the woman to the estrogen-progestin vaginal ring. Theoretically, this approach has two potential benefits: (1) the woman is less likely to have unscheduled bleeding related to a &quot;missed pill,&quot; and (2) the vaginal ring is associated with more constant hormone levels than OCs. Although there are no studies evaluating this approach, the resulting elimination of wide swings in serum estrogen and progestin concentrations may reduce bothersome unscheduled bleeding. The ring has excellent cycle control under normal circumstances; however, this may not be the case in a woman experiencing unscheduled bleeding.</p><p>There is no evidence that monophasic OCs are associated with less unscheduled bleeding than biphasic OCs, or that discontinuation due to dissatisfaction with bleeding patterns is different for the two formulations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/10,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,24</a>]. Some studies have found that triphasic OCs have a lower incidence of unscheduled bleeding than monophasic OCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>].</p><p>There is also no evidence that pill products by different manufacturers or different formulations of estrogen or progestin result in improved bleeding patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Although uncontrolled studies have reported decreased bleeding after changing formulations, bleeding would have probably stopped with continued use of the initial OC regardless of the type of product used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, if the patient requests another OC product, allowing her to switch is unlikely to worsen bleeding patterns and can improve overall satisfaction with OC use. Women on OCs containing &le;20 mcg estrogen can be switched to an OC with a higher estrogen dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] or the progestin can be switched to a different progestin (1<sup>st</sup> generation: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> acetate, ethynodiol diacetate, lynestrenol, norethynodrel; 2<sup>nd</sup> generation: dl-norgestrel, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a>; 3<sup>rd</sup> generation: desogestrel, gestodene, norgestimate) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Patients who use a 21-day estrogen-progestin pill may have fewer unscheduled days of bleeding than women using a 24-day regimen. Two studies have addressed this topic. One reported less unscheduled bleeding in women using a 21-day compared to a 24-day hormonally active pill (mean 4.6 versus 6.1 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and the other showed no difference between the two regimens in unscheduled bleeding days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Of note, the total days of bleeding (scheduled plus unscheduled) will be higher for women using a 21-day estrogen-progestin pill (mean 15.8 versus 13.2 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Doubling or tripling the daily dose of OCs is not recommended to decrease unscheduled bleeding.

However, estrogen dose and progestin type appear to play a role in the amount of unscheduled bleeding women experience with method initiation. In one randomized trial, use of an OC pill containing 30 mcg of EE during the first year of use resulted in significantly less unscheduled bleeding than a pill containing 20 mcg of EE (35.5 versus 47.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In another randomized trial, continuous use of OCs containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> acetate resulted in significantly more bleeding-free days than use of pills containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, the levonorgestrel dose (90 versus 100 mcg) does not seem to make a difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In women using continuous or extended OCs who experience problematic unscheduled bleeding, consideration should be given to using a different estrogen dose or progestin type.</p><p>If troublesome bleeding occurs, the United States Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use (2016) recommend discontinuing the combined hormonal contraceptive for three to four consecutive days (ie, a hormone-free interval), as long as this is done after the first 21 days of hormone use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Limited evidence from randomized trials supports this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The intervention of scheduling a short hormone-free interval can be repeated whenever bothersome breakthrough bleeding occurs, as long as the patient has had at least 21 days of active pills before taking a hormone-free interval. Over time, breakthrough bleeding episodes will become spaced out and stop. As an example, in one study where subjects were given the option of stopping the OC for four days if they had taken at least 24 days of active pills, the mean number of days of <span class=\"nowrap\">bleeding/spotting</span> decreased from 19 days in the first 3 months of the study to 10 days in months 9 to 12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. This technique should not be used more frequently than every three weeks in order to maintain contraceptive effectiveness. </p><p>The use of the antibiotic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> was not effective in decreasing unscheduled bleeding in continuous combined oral contraceptive users when taken at the onset of unscheduled bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The unscheduled bleeding that occurs with contraceptive use is not associated with decreased contraceptive effectiveness unless bleeding is the result of non-adherence to the method (eg, missed pills). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women should be provided with information about the frequency, course, and significance of uterine bleeding associated with various contraceptive methods. Proper counseling prior to method initiation allows women to choose the method that best suits their needs, prepares them for known side effects, and improves patient satisfaction and continuation (thus may reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women with unscheduled bleeding, the possibility of pregnancy, cervicitis, or endometrial or cervical pathology should be considered and excluded by appropriate laboratory tests and physical examination. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our general approach to management of unscheduled bleeding is summarized in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69054\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69054 \">algorithm 1</a>) and is generally in agreement with that of the United States Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use (2016) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F89826\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89826 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with unscheduled bleeding related to depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a>, we suggest expectant management rather than medical intervention (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Unscheduled bleeding episodes will usually decrease over time: absence of all bleeding and spotting after one and five years of use occurs in 50 and 80 percent of users, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For women who desire treatment to stop a current bleeding episode, we suggest use of supplemental estrogen (alone or as part of a low-dose estrogen-progestin oral contraceptive pill) over other medical therapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with unscheduled bleeding related to progestin implants, we suggest expectant management rather than medical therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Women using progestin-releasing implants are counseled that irregular bleeding is a common side effect, is not dangerous, and frequently improves during the first year of use. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Progestin-releasing implants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For women who desire treatment of unscheduled bleeding, we offer a trial of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy and then estrogen-progestin contraceptive pills for one to three cycles. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unscheduled bleeding occurs in up to 50 percent of women initiating estrogen-progestin contraceptive pills, but decreases to less than 10 percent by the third month of use. Taking the pills consistently and cessation of smoking may reduce unscheduled bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H15719109\" class=\"local\">'Estrogen-progestin contraceptives'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Women experiencing unscheduled bleeding while using a cyclic estrogen-progestin contraceptive can be given reassurance that bleeding patterns will improve over time. Those who would like to switch to another pill or another cyclic method, such as the contraceptive patch or the contraceptive ring, can do so, even though this has not been demonstrated to decrease unscheduled bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For women using continuous or extended cycle regimens with unscheduled bleeding, there are three options:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the ethinyl estradiol dose is 20 mcg, increase to a 30 mcg formulation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the progestin is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a>, switch to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> acetate formulation </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stop the contraceptive pill for three days to allow withdrawal bleeding and then resume use for at least 21 days </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progestin-only pills should be taken at the same time each day to minimize unscheduled bleeding. For women with persistent bothersome bleeding, we suggest switching to another method rather than providing estrogen supplementation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Progestin pills'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who desire treatment of unscheduled bleeding related to intrauterine contraception, we suggest NSAIDs rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> or hormone supplements (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We use either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> 400 mg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> 250 mg, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mefenamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mefenamic acid</a> 500 mg three times per day for five to seven days.
