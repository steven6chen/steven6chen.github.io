Military clinicians working in surgical hospitals in Vietnam called it shock lung, while civilian clinicians referred to it as adult respiratory distress syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Subsequent recognition that individuals of any age could be afflicted led to the current term, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).</p><p>The Berlin Definition of ARDS (published in 2012) has replaced the American-European Consensus Conference&rsquo;s definition of ARDS (published in 1994) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Mortality increases with disease severity. As an example, in a multicenter, international, prospective cohort study of 3022 patients with ARDS, unadjusted hospital mortality was reported to be 35 percent among those with mild ARDS, 40 percent for those with moderate disease and 46 percent for patients with severe ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Similar to other studies, mortality directly correlated with driving pressure (ie, the difference between plateau and positive end expiratory pressures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

In contrast, nosocomial pneumonia and sepsis are the most common causes of death among patients who die later in their clinical course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Patients uncommonly die from respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Numerous studies suggest that survival has improved over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/10,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15-17</a>]. As an example, an observational study of 2451 patients who had enrolled in ARDSNet randomized trials found a fall in mortality from 35 to 26 percent between 1996 and 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Although encouraging, a 2016 observational study of ARDS patients demonstrated that global mortality remains high with 40 percent dying in the hospital. To the extent that mortality may be decreasing with time, several issues should be considered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is not known if mortality has decreased among patients who received their care outside of a specialized center or a clinical trial.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The improved mortality may be attributable to patients who have ARDS related to risk factors other than sepsis, such as trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To the extent that mortality has decreased, the reasons are uncertain. Likely causes include better supportive care and improved ventilatory strategies, such as low tidal volume ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/3,16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16,18</a>].

Such factors can be categorized as patient-, disease-, or treatment-related. No single factor has proven to be superior to the others.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient-related</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older patients appear to be at an increased risk for death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/5,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,19</a>]. This was illustrated by a multicenter cohort study that followed 1113 patients with ARDS for 15 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The mortality rate increased progressively with age, ranging from 24 percent among patients 15 to 19 years of age to 60 percent among patients 85 years of age or older. The overall mortality rate was 41 percent. Although it has been suggested that obesity may impact the mortality of critically ill patients with or without ARDS, evidence is conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/20-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Disease-related</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disease-related predictors of mortality include severe hypoxemia, failure of oxygenation to improve, pulmonary vascular dysfunction, increased dead space, infection, a high severity of illness score, a non-traumatic cause of the ARDS, and certain biomarkers and gene polymorphisms.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gas exchange &ndash; The severity of hypoxemia determines whether the patient has mild ARDS (arterial oxygen <span class=\"nowrap\">tension/fraction</span> of inspired oxygen [PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub>]</span> &gt;200 but &le;300 mmHg), moderate ARDS (PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub></span> &gt;100 but &le;200 mmHg), or severe ARDS (PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub></span> &le;100 mmHg). Mortality appears to increase as ARDS becomes more severe, according to an observational study of 3670 patients with ARDS that found that patients with mild, moderate, and severe ARDS had mortality rates of 27, 32, and 45 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Similarly, there is general agreement that improvement of oxygenation during the early intensive care unit (ICU) course correlates with survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Severe hypercapnia (partial arterial pressure of carbon dioxide [PaCO<sub>2 </sub>] &ge;50 mmHg) may also indicate increased mortality, higher complication rates, and more organ failures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary vascular dysfunction &ndash; Pulmonary vascular dysfunction is indicated by an elevated transpulmonary gradient (ie, &ge;12 mmHg) or pulmonary vascular resistance index (ie, &gt;285 dyne <span class=\"nowrap\">s/cm)</span>. The transpulmonary gradient is the difference between the mean pulmonary artery pressure and the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, while the pulmonary vascular resistance index is the transpulmonary gradient divided by the cardiac index. Pulmonary vascular dysfunction appears to be an independent risk factor for 60-day mortality and fewer ventilator-free, ICU-free, and hypotension- or vasopressor-free days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher extravascular lung water and pulmonary vascular permeability indices correlate independently with 28 day mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dead space &ndash; Dead space ventilation early in the course of ARDS appears to correlate with mortality. This was illustrated by a series of 179 patients with early ARDS who had their ratio of dead space to tidal volume (ie, the dead space fraction or <span class=\"nowrap\">Vd/Vt)</span> determined by measuring exhaled carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The dead space fraction was markedly elevated (mean 0.58, normal &lt;0.30) and there was a linear correlation between the degree of dead space ventilation and mortality. For every 0.05 increase in dead space fraction, the odds of death increased by 45 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection &ndash; Infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> multiorgan dysfunction are better predictors of mortality than respiratory parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/15,33-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,33-38</a>].

As an example, patients with a higher APACHE III score have an increased likelihood of death (odds ratio 1.78 per 25-point increase, 95% CI 1.16-2.73) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Severe but not mild or moderate alcohol misuse, in patients with acute lung injury, is associated with an increased risk of death or persistent hospitalization at 90 days (adjusted odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.87) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The presence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) on lung biopsy is also associated with a worse prognosis compared with those who had non DAD-associated ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory &ndash; Routine laboratory parameters are not helpful for predicting the outcome of ARDS.

Similar to that observed in survivors of any critical illness, morbidities are usually evident upon discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU). Many of the cognitive, psychiatric, and physical manifestations are present for at least five years and they tend to resolve slowly. The occurrence and resolution of symptoms are frequently co-dependent. Neuropsychologic and physical impairments after ARDS are discussed in this section. The epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical manifestations, outcome, and treatment of post-intensive care syndrome are discussed separately.

In two observational studies of a total of 310 ARDS survivors, impaired neurocognitive function was reported in 30 percent and 49 percent of patients at 12 months following the acute illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/54,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,58</a>]. These rates are similar to that reported in the largest study of survivors of critical illness where 40 percent had neurocognitive deficits at three months; these persisted at 12 months in the vast majority [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

These rates are higher than those reported from a national data base study that reported 1 percent of survivors had a newly diagnosed psychologic disorder (mostly anxiety and depression) and 19 percent received one or more prescriptions for psychoactive medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The difference may be due to differences in the study population (all comers as opposed to ARDS), location (Denmark as opposed to North America), technique to acquire data (database as opposed to following a cohort), and diagnostic criteria (medication, referral to a psychiatrist as opposed to self-reporting). In a study reporting psychiatric symptoms, 66 percent of ARDS survivors had substantial symptoms of depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during one year follow up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

Significant risk factors for subsequent physical decline included increased age and pre-ARDS comorbidity. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A longitudinal prospective cohort study of 156 ARDS survivors showed an association between muscle weakness at hospital discharge and increased five-year mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Thirty-eight percent of patients had demonstrable muscle weakness at discharge, and this was associated with worse five-year survival. Fifty percent experienced either persistent or resolving weakness trajectories during the follow up period, and these were associated with more than a threefold greater hazard of death compared to patients without weakness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung function &ndash; Lung function following ARDS is commonly compromised for as long as five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/48,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,50,51</a>]. However, it is uncertain whether decreased lung function results in physical impairment. The degree of compromise depends on which parameter of lung function is measured (spirometry, lung volumes, diffusing capacity). For example, upon discharge, approximately 80 percent of patients will have a reduction in diffusing capacity and a smaller percentage will have airflow obstruction (20 percent) or restriction (20 percent) on spirometry and lung volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In most patients, lung volumes and spirometry will normalize (ie, measure within 80 percent of predicted values) by six months, and diffusion capacity should normalize by five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults/abstract/48,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,50,51</a>].

Diagnostic criteria for ARDS are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults#H10171195\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ARDS is associated with appreciable mortality, with estimates ranging from 26 to 58 percent. In-hospital survival appears to have improved over time. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The underlying cause of the ARDS is the usual cause of death among patients who die early. In contrast, sepsis due to nosocomial pulmonary infection is the most common cause of death among patients who die later in their clinical course. Patients seldom die from respiratory failure. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are numerous factors that can be assessed during the acute illness that may predict mortality. However, no single factor appears to be superior to the others. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Predictors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survivors of ARDS can develop cognitive, psychological, and physical impairments that may last for months to years following their acute illness. In addition many have abnormalities in pulmonary function that are generally mild, as well as reduced quality of life for at least two to five years following the acute illness.
