This topic review covers the techniques, results, and complications of transsphenoidal surgery of pituitary adenomas and other sellar masses. The endocrine evaluation of these disorders, as well as options for medical therapy of prolactinomas and acromegaly, are reviewed elsewhere.

In addition, patients with hormonal deficiencies (eg, hypothyroidism) should be identified and, if necessary, treated preoperatively. (See <a href=\"#H21307984\" class=\"local\">'Perioperative management'</a> below.)</p><p>Airway management may be difficult in patients with acromegaly and Cushing's disease because of anatomic distortion. Importantly, airway evaluation using the usual metrics (eg, Mallampati classification, mouth opening, neck range of motion, thyromental distance) may be falsely reassuring in patients with acromegaly<sup> </sup>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94434\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94434 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94436\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94436 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F94433\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94433 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108798\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108798 \">table 4</a>)<sup> </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].<sup> </sup>Equipment and personnel for difficult airway management should be immediately available during induction of anesthesia for these patients. Awake intubation may be the best option in severely affected patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-difficult-airway-for-general-anesthesia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the difficult airway for general anesthesia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For acromegalic patients with severe airway compromise, it may be advisable to pre-treat the patient with a somatostatin analog or growth hormone receptor antagonist for a few months prior to planned surgery, in an attempt to minimize airway edema and facilitate safe intubation. Similarly, those acromegalic patients with significant cardiomyopathy may benefit from pre-treatment in an attempt to improve cardiac function before undergoing transsphenoidal surgery. (See <a href=\"#H21308014\" class=\"local\">'Somatotroph adenomas (acromegaly)'</a> below.) </p><p>Patients with acromegaly and Cushing's disease are at increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, and other manifestations that may affect anesthetic care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-acromegaly#H10530955\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and clinical manifestations of acromegaly&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.) </p><p>We typically assume that all non-Cushing's patients undergoing transsphenoidal surgery are adrenally insufficient and administer stress dose glucocorticoid prior to anesthesia induction.

Successful resection requires that the surgeon:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Navigate to the sella</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visualize the tumor through a relatively narrow corridor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the tumor as completely as possible</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimize damage to the surrounding structures, including the nonadenomatous pituitary</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21307884\"><span class=\"h2\">Navigation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Precise navigation to the sella is critical because it is bounded by the carotid arteries and optic nerves and chiasm; two techniques are in common use:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraoperative fluoroscopy, which gives real-time localization relative to bony anatomy, though only in the two-dimensional sagittal plane</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuronavigation devices, which provide computed localization referenced to a three-dimensional (3D) space calculated from preoperative imaging</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21307890\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three transsphenoidal approaches are commonly used today:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sublabial &ndash; This employs an incision through the upper gum to reach the nasal aperture and then approaches submucosally along the septum to the sphenoid. While this approach provides wide access, it requires a painful incision, and the submucosal tunnel necessitates postoperative nasal packing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal aperture &ndash; A mucosal incision can be made at the anterior nasal aperture, directly raising a submucosal tunnel and approaching posteriorly along the septum; this avoids the sublabial incision, but access is somewhat more limited by the diameter of the nasal passage, and postoperative packing is still required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior nasopharynx &ndash; It is possible to approach the sphenoid directly through the posterior nasopharynx, with an incision at the sphenoid ostia or posterior septum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This approach is also constrained by the size of the nasal passage, but since no submucosal tunnel is used, no packing is usually required.</p><p/><p>In addition, the introduction of improved endoscopic techniques has allowed the development of the &quot;extended transsphenoidal&quot; approach, where a portion of the tuberculum sella is removed. This permits resection of suprasellar tumors with intracranial extension but carries a significantly greater risk of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and intracranial complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21307924\"><span class=\"h2\">Visualization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The introduction of the operative microscope to pituitary surgery by Hardy in the early 1960s allowed the removal of microadenomas and revolutionized the surgical treatment of pituitary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21307930\"><span class=\"h3\">Operating microscope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The operating microscope provides superb optics with binocular vision, but visualization is constrained to line of sight along a relatively narrow corridor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21307936\"><span class=\"h3\">Endoscope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon advances made in sinus surgery, the endoscope was introduced to transsphenoidal surgery in the early 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It allows a wider field of view, which is useful in large tumors. The operative field is visualized on a high-definition screen. Because most endoscopes are monocular, the surgeon loses binocular vision and depth perception, although 3D endoscopes are under development. Although marketed as relatively &quot;noninvasive,&quot; the width of access required for successful manipulation of the endoscope and resection tools may actually require greater dissection in the nasal cavity itself, with partial resection of the turbinates and a wider opening in the face of the sphenoid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21307942\"><span class=\"h2\">Resection and repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most tumor resection can be done with a combination of transsphenoidal curettes and suction. The extent of the resection depends on the consistency of the tumor, which may vary considerably, from very soft to very fibrous. Softer tumors will be easier to resect more completely and easier to separate from the normal gland, allowing its preservation. Fibrous tumors are more difficult to resect and to dissect from the normal pituitary, increasing the chance that the nonadenomatous pituitary will be damaged, resulting in postoperative hormone deficiencies. The adenoma can sometimes be excised intact (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F91473\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef91473 \">movie 1</a>). After tumor removal, the sella is usually reconstructed with subcutaneous abdominal fat, muscle, or artificial hemostatic material, especially in cases of intraoperative CSF leakage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21307948\"><span class=\"h2\">Determination of the extent of resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determining the extent of tumor resection may be difficult but is aided by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indirect cues, eg, prolapse of the diaphragm sella into the surgical field, which suggests adequate decompression of the chiasm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopy, which may allow visualization at angles not possible to be seen directly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This requires the construction of a shielded operating room at significant cost, with workflow altered by the presence of a strong magnetic field. Studies report variable rates (5 to 60 percent) of additional adenoma resection by using this technique<sup> </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/7-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-13</a>], but the results can be difficult to interpret because the studies employ different magnet strengths (0.5 to 3.0 T), vary in size of the adenomas resected (micro to macro), and the timing of the initial images are at the surgeon's discretion (imaging earlier in the course of surgery will inflate the utility of the technique).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21307954\"><span class=\"h2\">Risks of surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risks of surgery include hormonal deficiencies and damage to parasellar structures, as well as general surgical risks.

Two studies illustrate the importance of the pituitary surgeon's experience:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a survey of 958 neurosurgeons, those who reported performing a total of more than 500 transsphenoidal procedures reported fewer serious and less serious complications than a neurosurgeon who had performed fewer than 200 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F68269\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68269 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample 1996 to 2000, neurosurgeons who performed more procedures had fewer complications than those who performed fewer surgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21307966\"><span class=\"h3\">Hormonal deficiencies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of new postoperative hormonal deficiencies ranged from 7 to 20 percent in one large survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In a meta-analysis, the incidence of new postoperative hormone insufficiency was 5 to 10 percent for prolactinomas, growth-hormone secreting adenomas, and nonfunctioning tumors but was considerably higher (25 percent) for patients with Cushing's disease; this may be due to the need for long-term steroid replacement, or to the more extensive dissection within the gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The risk of hormone insufficiency also varies with the size and consistency of the adenoma, the extent of resection, and the experience of the surgeon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Deficiencies result from damage to, or excision of, the anterior pituitary or the stalk. The latter causes diabetes insipidus, which occurs transiently in approximately 10 to 20 percent of surgeries but permanently in only 2 to 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/14,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21307972\"><span class=\"h3\">Damage to parasellar structures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Potential damage to parasellar structures as a result of surgery include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CSF rhinorrhea &ndash; This occurs in 0.5 to 4 percent of reported cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. If lumbar subarachnoid diversion is unsuccessful in allowing the leak to heal, reoperation for repacking of the adenoma bed is required. Failure to stop the leak risks meningitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damage to an internal carotid artery &ndash; This damage results from operating too far from the midline and can result in massive, sometimes fatal, hemorrhage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damage to the optic chiasm or optic nerves &ndash; This can result from direct damage but more commonly results from postoperative hemorrhage into residual adenoma causing compression of the suprasellar chiasm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical mortality &ndash; The complications listed above are serious and can lead to death. In the United States, surgical mortality is estimated to be approximately 0.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], perhaps &lt;0.2 percent in more experienced centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21307978\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison of microscopic versus endoscopic techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comparison of the two techniques is limited because few studies are prospective or randomized. Comparison therefore is based upon reviews and meta-analyses of studies of the individual techniques.</p><p>Several meta-analyses have shown no clear difference between the two techniques in complete removal of the adenoma. The largest of these reviewed 38 papers, of which 24 reported endoscopic results in 2125 patients and 22 reported microscopic results in 3518 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Complete resection rates were similar using the two techniques, 69 percent (64 to 73 percent) endoscopically and 64 percent (58 to 71 percent) microscopically. Reviews and meta-analyses of smaller numbers of patients also reported similar rates of complete resection (gross tumor removal) between the two techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p>Some of these reviews report that the endoscopic approach showed decreased operating time, length of hospital stay, risk of diabetes insipidus, nasal complications, and pain and discomfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>], although for many, the control group is the older, more invasive sublabial approach. The largest meta-analysis reported no significant difference in several complications between the two techniques, with the exception of increased risk of vascular complications with endoscopic procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The studies included in most meta-analyses, however, are retrospective and are neither randomized nor controlled. One meta-analysis included two randomized and three prospective, nonrandomized trials, but the number of patients was too small to draw definitive conclusions about the comparative efficacy or risks of the two techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21307984\"><span class=\"h2\">Perioperative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend evaluation of pituitary function in patients with sellar masses before and after transsphenoidal surgery. Prior to surgery, the evaluation should focus on determining the presence of hormonal hypersecretion, in order to identify, if possible, if the mass is a secretory adenoma. The evaluation should also determine if any hormonal deficiencies exist. Hypothyroidism should be treated before surgery because of the increased anesthetic risk of narcotics and barbiturates in the hypothyroid patient. Acromegalic patients with obvious predictors of difficulty with airway management during anesthesia or with cardiomyopathy may require treatment with a somatostatin analog or growth hormone receptor antagonist for several months prior to surgery. (See <a href=\"#H2640143164\" class=\"local\">'Anesthetic concerns'</a> above.) </p><p>Management during and immediately after surgery involves the evaluation and treatment of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cortisol deficiency &ndash; During and immediately after surgery, some experts routinely treat with glucocorticoids until normal adrenal function is demonstrated, but others wait until postoperative evaluation has demonstrated cortisol deficiency to treat.

Some patients have all three phases, and others have only diabetes insipidus or only SIADH. For this reason, fluid intake and output, serum sodium, and urine osmolality should be measured at least once a day for a few days after surgery. If no abnormalities are found, sodium should be measured one to two weeks after surgery to determine if SIADH has occurred.

All of these reports were from centers where one or two surgeons perform large numbers of procedures.</p><p>The cure rate is lower, however, when surgery is performed at institutions where it is performed less often. For example, in a report of 1344 patients with all sizes of adenomas at 42 centers in the German Acromegaly Registry, the cure rate was 38.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Centers that performed more surgeries had better rates than those that performed fewer.</p><p>Because the surgical remission rate is lower when the adenoma is larger and invasive, treatment algorithms have been developed using medical treatment with somatostatin analogues (SSAs) as primary therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, the overall remission rate (GH &lt;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> and normal IGF-1) for primary medical treatment with SSAs in unselected patient groups (ie, unselected for responsiveness to SSAs) appears to be only 20 to 25 percent in medically na&iuml;ve patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>], and response to SSAs is a function of pretreatment GH levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This author therefore recommends debulking surgery in many patients where surgical cure cannot be achieved, although primary medical treatment in some of these cases is a reasonable option.</p><p>Surgical debulking should definitely be considered if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is visual impairment, as surgery offers a much better chance of restoring vision quickly than a somatostatin analog.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary medical treatment has failed, as surgical debulking appears to increase the responsiveness of somatotroph adenomas to medical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pretreatment of somatotroph adenomas with an SSA has been proposed to reduce the size of the adenoma and thereby increase the chance of complete removal, but the results are unclear. Although randomized, prospective trials have shown an increased cure rate with pretreatment, interpretation is uncertain because the cure rates in the untreated patient groups were much lower than typical by historical standards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. Another possible benefit of pretreatment with an SSA is improvement in the medical comorbidities that increase anesthetic risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2640143164\" class=\"local\">'Anesthetic concerns'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one meta-analysis, recurrence rates for acromegaly after apparent initial cure were approximately 5 percent at six years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21308020\"><span class=\"h2\">Corticotroph adenomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who have corticotroph micro- or macroadenomas, we recommend transsphenoidal surgery as initial treatment. Prior to contemplating surgery, however, the diagnosis of Cushing's disease must be firmly established by demonstration of corticotropin (ACTH)-dependent hypercortisolemia and clear evidence that the pituitary is the source of the ACTH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-the-cause-of-cushings-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing the cause of Cushing's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If surgery is successful, the serum cortisol falls dramatically by the first or second postoperative day, although some patients have delayed remissions from several days to several months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Practice varies as how to balance the need for assessing adrenal status and treating the severe adrenal insufficiency that occurs if surgery has been successful. Some experts do not administer exogenous glucocorticoids during and after surgery; instead, they measure serum cortisol at 8 AM the next morning and administer a glucocorticoid only if the patient has signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> very low serum cortisol. Others administer a glucocorticoid (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> or low dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>) and measure serum cortisol one to several days later, often as an outpatient. Dexamethasone does not interfere with the cortisol assay and therefore need not be discontinued for measurement of cortisol levels. If surgery has been successful, glucocorticoid replacement, in gradually decreasing doses, may be required for up to a year afterwards.</p><p>Success of initial surgery depends on the size of the adenoma. In one report, the success rate for 72 microadenomas was 94.5 percent and, for 11 macroadenomas, 64.0 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In another report, the success rate for 103 microadenomas was 72.8 percent and, for 21 macroadenomas, 42.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In two other reports that did not distinguish between micro- and macroadenomas, the success rates were 82.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] and 72.0 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 5787 patients in 50 papers over a 30-year period, the overall success rate was 71.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In the author's experience, success also depends on whether or not the adenoma can be visualized by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Those visualized offer the best surgical results, but remission is often achieved even if not. In the absence of visualization by MRI, confirmation of a pituitary source of ACTH by inferior petrosal sinus catheterization is mandatory.</p><p>When surgery has been unsuccessful, and even a delayed remission excluded, additional treatment is needed. One option is repeat surgery. Most surgeons, including the author of this topic, favor re-exploration within a few weeks, because postoperative scarring later makes re-exploration more difficult. Early pituitary re-exploration has been reported to achieve remission in an additional 50 to 70 percent of patients, although the incidence of hypoadrenalism is greater [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. Many endocrinologists consider other treatments when initial surgery is unsuccessful, including total adrenalectomy, pituitary radiation, and pharmacologic treatment, based upon on the patients' individual circumstances. For example, a patient who has severe manifestations of cortisol excess may be a potential candidate for total adrenalectomy, while a patient with milder disease may be a candidate for pituitary radiation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-therapy-of-cushings-disease-transsphenoidal-surgery-and-pituitary-irradiation#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary therapy of Cushing's disease: Transsphenoidal surgery and pituitary irradiation&quot;, section on 'Treatment if surgery fails'</a>.)</p><p>Even when initial surgery appears to have been successful, there may be a very small amount of residual adenoma tissue that grows and eventually results in recurrent cortisol excess. Estimates of recurrence rate in the literature vary from 3 to 25 percent at five years but appear to average at approximately 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/16,53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,53-55</a>]. The risk of recurrence depends on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The size of the adenoma &ndash; The chance of recurrence is more common in macro- than microadenomas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Criteria used to determine success of surgery &ndash; More stringent initial remission criteria may be associated with lower recurrence rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], although this is not completely clear, and even patients with initially undetectable postoperative cortisol levels may later have a recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. There is a higher rate of recurrence in patients whose postoperative cortisol levels are normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], as opposed to subnormal, and in those patients whose initial remission was delayed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of follow-up &ndash; Most recurrences occur within five years after surgery, but some occur up to 10 years later and rarely thereafter.</p><p/><p>A recurrence must be treated, and reoperation is one option. Success of reoperation is approximately 40 to 60 percent, but even some of those apparently successful will recur again [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. One cause of persistent recurrence is thought to be invasion of adenoma cells into the dura, which is technically difficult to resect. Dural invasion has been estimated to occur in approximately 34 percent of cases based on dural biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transsphenoidal-surgery-for-pituitary-adenomas-and-other-sellar-masses/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Some pituitary neurosurgeons use an operating microscope, and others use an endoscope. The risk of serious side effects, including visual loss, hemorrhage, and meningitis, are quite low and similar using both techniques. The risks of pituitary hormonal deficiencies are also similar using the two techniques, as is the likelihood of complete removal of the adenoma in most cases. Experienced surgeons have greater success in removing the adenoma completely and a lower incidence of complications.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When surgery has been chosen as the best treatment for a patient with a pituitary adenoma, we recommend that the patient be referred to a surgeon who specializes in pituitary surgery and has extensive experience in either the microscopic or endoscopic approach (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21307960\" class=\"local\">'Experience of the surgeon'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anesthetic concerns for patients who undergo transsphenoidal surgery are most significant for patients who have secretory lesions (ie, patients with acromegaly and Cushing's disease). Airway management during anesthesia may be unexpectedly difficult, and these patients may have comorbidities that affect anesthetic management. (See <a href=\"#H2640143164\" class=\"local\">'Anesthetic concerns'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend hormonal evaluation before surgery to determine the presence of a secretory adenoma and also to determine if hormonal deficiencies exist that may require preoperative replacement (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We recommend re-evaluation of hormonal function after surgery to determine if hypersecretion by the adenoma has been corrected and if hormonal function of the normal gland has improved or worsened (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21307984\" class=\"local\">'Perioperative management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have lactotroph adenomas, no matter how large, we recommend a dopamine agonist, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabergoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabergoline</a>, as initial treatment in most cases (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21308008\" class=\"local\">'Lactotroph adenomas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have lactotroph macroadenomas that impair vision and either do not respond, or have intolerable side effects, to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabergoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabergoline</a>, we recommend transsphenoidal surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). A woman with a large macroprolactinoma may wish to consider surgery before pregnancy because of the risk that it will increase to a clinically important size before delivery, or may require ongoing dopamine agonist treatment during the pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H21308008\" class=\"local\">'Lactotroph adenomas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have a somatotroph adenoma that is entirely or mostly confined to the sella or a larger adenoma that is impairing vision, we recommend transsphenoidal surgery as initial treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We also suggest consideration of surgery for a somatotroph adenoma that is not thought to be entirely resectable, in order to improve the growth hormone (GH) response to pharmacologic treatment. (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21308014\" class=\"local\">'Somatotroph adenomas (acromegaly)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have corticotroph micro- or macroadenomas, we recommend transsphenoidal surgery as the initial treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). If the initial surgery is not successful, we favor re-exploration within a few weeks because postoperative scarring later makes re-exploration more difficult. Early pituitary re-exploration has been reported to achieve remission in an additional 50 to 70 percent of patients, although the incidence of hypoadrenalism is greater. Other treatment options include total adrenalectomy, pituitary radiation, and pharmacologic treatment.
