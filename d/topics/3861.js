All are associated with ANCA and have similar features on renal histology (eg, a focal necrotizing, often crescentic, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis).</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of GPA, MPA, and RLV are reviewed here. EGPA has a different presentation and prognosis compared with the other forms of AAV.

The International Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC) criteria, which were revised in 2012, are the mostly commonly cited (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F90189\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90189 \">table 1</a>). However, as will be described, the classification algorithms have important limitations. (See <a href=\"#H271324763\" class=\"local\">'Limitations of classification algorithms'</a> below.) </p><p>Renal-limited vasculitis (RLV) is considered to be part of the microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) spectrum because the histopathologic findings in the kidney are often indistinguishable from those in MPA or granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. RLV is discussed in more detail below. (See <a href=\"#H647065488\" class=\"local\">'Renal-limited vasculitis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11698517\"><span class=\"h2\">ACR criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 classification criteria were aimed at defining criteria for the vasculitides to facilitate standardization of research in patients with GPA and to help distinguish these patients from those with other forms of vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, these criteria were launched before the widespread recognition of MPA as a separate clinical entity and prior to recognition of the significance of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA) testing as a diagnostic tool. </p><p>While the ACR classification criteria have been helpful and widely used in clinical research in GPA and other vasculitides, they lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as diagnostic criteria, a role they were never intended to fulfill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The ACR criteria for GPA include the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal or oral inflammation (painful or painless oral ulcers, or purulent or bloody nasal discharge)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal chest radiograph showing nodules, fixed infiltrates, or cavities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal urinary sediment (microscopic hematuria with or without red cell casts)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Granulomatous inflammation on biopsy of an artery or perivascular area</p><p/><p>The presence of two or more of these four criteria yielded a sensitivity of 88 percent and a specificity of 92 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Since the ACR did not establish specific criteria for MPA, these criteria did <strong>not</strong> discriminate GPA from either MPA or nonvasculitic diseases that can mimic GPA. (See <a href=\"#H11699683\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11698524\"><span class=\"h2\">Chapel Hill Consensus Conference criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CHCC provided definitions of disease, but not classification criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. These definitions have gained wide acceptance in defining vasculitides by pathology, including the size of affected vessels and the organ systems involved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F90189\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90189 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GPA, MPA, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, Churg-Strauss) were distinguished from other systemic small-vessel vasculitides by the absence of immune deposits</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MPA was distinguished from GPA and EGPA by the absence of granuloma formation and the presence of a necrotizing vasculitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The potential value of ANCA serology was noted but not included as a criterion for diagnosis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11698531\"><span class=\"h2\">European Medicines Agency algorithm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The European Medicines Agency (EMA) algorithm combined, in a stepwise manner, the criteria for EGPA, followed by the ACR criteria and CHCC definitions for GPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The diagnosis of MPA was made only after EGPA and GPA were excluded. Using this algorithm, fixed infiltrates that are present on a chest radiograph for over one month result in a classification of GPA even though fixed infiltrates are most likely to be caused by pulmonary capillaritis on pathologic examination. </p><p>It was suggested that the following surrogate markers might permit the diagnosis of GPA to be made in the <strong>absence</strong> of a biopsy: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower airways: radiograph evidence of fixed pulmonary infiltrates, nodules, or cavitations for more than one month, or bronchial stenosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper airways: bloody nasal discharge and crusting for more than one month or nasal ulceration; chronic sinusitis, otitis media or mastoiditis for more than three months; retro-orbital mass or inflammation; subglottic stenosis; saddle nose <span class=\"nowrap\">deformity/destructive</span> sinonasal disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glomerulonephritis: hematuria associated with red cell casts or &gt;10 dysmorphic red cells; or 2+ hematuria or 2+ proteinuria on dipstick.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ANCA was included as a diagnostic criterion. A positive ANCA in a patient with surrogate markers for GPA allowed a diagnosis of GPA without a biopsy.</p><p/><p>The use of this algorithm permitted the classification of patients with a correlation among observers of 91.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and resulted in fewer unclassified patients than either the ACR criteria or CHCC definitions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, most patients who have MPA would be still be unclassified by this method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H271324763\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations of classification algorithms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CHCC provided definitions for GPA, MPA, and EGPA so that each disorder could be distinguished from the others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Using this approach, patients can be diagnosed with MPA if there is no pathological evidence for GPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In clinical practice, patients are determined to have GPA if they have destruction in their upper respiratory tract <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nodules or cavities in the lower respiratory tract, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if they have granulomatosis on biopsy of any organ. Thus, patients who have nasal disease and necrotizing vasculitis on biopsy but no evidence of granulomatosis are labeled as having MPA.</p><p>None of the algorithms reliably distinguish between GPA and MPA in all patients. The defining pathological difference between GPA and MPA is the presence of granulomatous changes on biopsy, which may be missed due to sampling error. As described below, there is significant overlap in the signs and symptoms and in the ANCA serologies between GPA and MPA. In addition, some patients present initially with only manifestations consistent with MPA but subsequently develop new manifestations that are more consistent with GPA. (See <a href=\"#H11698538\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> below.)</p><p>The inability to establish a specific diagnosis may be clinically important since the extrarenal manifestations, such as lesions of the upper airway, may require different therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and since the rate of relapse is different [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, an analysis of patients followed in the southeastern United States found that the definitions of GPA or MPA did not predict long-term outcome or the propensity for relapse as strongly as serologic tests for MPO-ANCA and PR3-ANCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the absence of clearly accepted criteria for allocation of patients into specific disease categories, the use of the terms &quot;GPA&quot; and &quot;MPA&quot; will remain somewhat imprecise and may differ on the basis of geography and specialty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>An alternative approach to classification is based upon ANCA serology. The rationale for an ANCA-based classification is based upon the dual premises that patients who have PR3- or MPO-ANCA have more closely associated disease findings and that respective ANCA subtypes have better predictive value with respect to long-term outcome and relapse propensity than do either the terms &quot;GPA&quot; or &quot;EGPA.&quot; Patients who are ANCA negative can have a GPA, MPA, or RLV phenotype. However, immunosuppressive therapy is the same for patients with GPA, MPA, or RLV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/6,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identification-and-management-of-relapsing-disease-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identification and management of relapsing disease in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;, section on 'Risk factors for relapse'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial immunosuppressive therapy in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>A proposal has been made to address the problems with the ACR criteria, the CHCC definitions, and the EMA algorithm by using the terms &quot;PR3-ANCA disease,&quot; &quot;MPO-ANCA disease,&quot; and &quot;seronegative ANCA disease.&quot; With this approach, no diagnostic criteria are needed other than serological findings. The fact that PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA have more prognostic significance than the terms &quot;MPA&quot; and &quot;GPA&quot; with respect to response to therapy, propensity for relapse, and patient outcome supports this proposed change in classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16</a>]. In addition, genetic variants that are associated with ANCA disease are more specifically linked with the antigen (proteinase 3 [PR3] versus myeloperoxidase [MPO]) rather than with the clinical phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>In recognition of the foregoing limitations, the ACR and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) have sponsored a large international project (the Diagnostic and Classification Criteria in Vasculitis Study, DCVAS) to develop new criteria for many forms of vasculitis, including GPA and MPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11698538\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) most commonly occur in older adults, although these diseases have been reported at all ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

The recovered samples are visually inspected for any increase in hemorrhagic appearance from the first syringe to the third and are microscopically examined for red cells and leukocytes. Although BAL is a key step in the diagnosis of alveolar hemorrhage, it has limited use in identifying a specific etiology.

However, patients should be treated empirically if the clinical suspicion for AAV is high and a tissue diagnosis cannot be obtained in a timely manner. Tissue for diagnosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prognosis is usually obtained from a skin or kidney biopsy. Biopsy of the skin reveals a &quot;nonspecific&quot; leukocytoclastic vasculitis with little or no complement and immunoglobulin on immunofluorescence. Biopsy of the kidney typically shows a pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. (See <a href=\"#H647065861\" class=\"local\">'Renal histology'</a> below.) </p><p>Less commonly, a lung biopsy can be performed (usually thoracoscopic) in place of a kidney or skin biopsy. We rarely perform transbronchial lung biopsies or nasal biopsies since these tests are often unhelpful.</p><p>Renal biopsies are commonly done in patients with overt manifestations of renal disease (such as reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate or active urine sediment). Many experts, however, feel that a kidney biopsy is not required for the initiation of therapy among patients who have been diagnosed with GPA or MPA (or RLV) using clinical and serologic features and histologic analysis of tissue of another affected organ such as the skin or lung. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical spectrum of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies&quot;, section on 'Others'</a>.)</p><p>Nasal biopsy, although relatively noninvasive, is limited by the high rate of falsely negative or nonspecific results due to the small amount of tissue that can be removed, and, therefore, we rarely perform nasal biopsies in the diagnostic evaluation of AAV. Occasionally, the nasal biopsy may be useful in identifying other causes of upper respiratory track symptoms, such as infection, malignancy, and noninflammatory disease (trauma). A typical finding on upper respiratory tract biopsies in patients with AAV is acute and chronic inflammation either with a capillaritis or, less commonly, granulomatous features. Granulomatous inflammation is diagnostic for GPA. </p><p>In the absence of renal involvement, the diagnosis of AAV may be made by lung biopsy. Lung biopsy most often requires open or thoracoscopic lung biopsy. In a small number of cases (&lt;10 percent), sufficient tissue for diagnosis can be obtained by transbronchial biopsy of the lung; however, the absence of granulomatous vasculitis on transbronchial specimens should not be considered adequate evidence to exclude the diagnosis of GPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Thus, we rarely perform transbronchial biopsy in the diagnostic evaluation of AAV. Among patients with MPA who undergo lung biopsy, the typical histological lesion is pulmonary capillaritis. Among patients with GPA, granulomatous inflammation may be seen. Special stains and cultures should be routinely sent to exclude the presence of infections that can produce granulomas (eg, tuberculosis), vasculitis, or necrosis.</p><p>A positive lung biopsy precludes the need for a kidney biopsy in many cases. However, a renal biopsy is indicated when there is suspicion of an alternative or concomitant disease process occurring in the kidney or if the treatment selected (eg, the use of plasma exchange in addition to immunosuppressive therapy) depends upon the presence of confirmed vasculitis in the kidney.

The cardinal features of classic polyarteritis nodosa include renal infarcts, renal artery stenosis, and visceral microaneurysms, all of which are infrequently observed in MPA.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GPA and MPA most commonly occur in older, white adults, but they can also occur children and younger adults and in non-whites. Both sexes are equally affected. The clinical presentation in patients with GPA and MPA is nonspecific. GPA and MPA can present and progress slowly over months or explosively over days. Patients typically present with constitutional symptoms including fever, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss. Prodromal symptoms may last for weeks to months without evidence of specific organ involvement.

A positive ANCA test strongly suggests the diagnosis of vasculitis, but both diagnostically false-positive and false-negative results may be seen. Histologic examination of tissue obtained by biopsy of an affected organ (generally, skin, kidney, or lung) remains the most definitive method to establish a diagnosis. Prompt diagnosis is important to permit initiation of therapy that may be life saving and organ sparing.

Although making a presumptive diagnosis may allow for early initiation of treatment, efforts should be made to obtain a tissue diagnosis as soon as possible.
