More than 200 years later, cardiac glycosides are still prescribed for patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction.</p><p>While the overall use of digitalis has declined, the number of patients admitted with digitalis toxicity has remained stable and the use of digitalis antibody fragments has increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In 2011, there were 2513 cases of cardiac glycoside exposures reported to United States poison control centers. Of these, 132 patients suffered major toxicity and 27 died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In addition to digitalis, other cardiac glycosides exist and have been associated with toxicity. These include: the xenobiotics ouabain and lanatoside C; various plants, including foxglove, dogbane, red squill, lily of the valley, oleander, and henbane; and bufadienolides, cardioactive steroids found in the skin of toads belonging to the Bufonidae family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In 2011, there were an additional 1376 cases of cardiac glycoside exposure from various plant species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The pharmacology, diagnosis, and management of acute and chronic digitalis poisoning will be reviewed here. The dosing of digoxin-specific antibody (Fab) fragments for the treatment of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> toxicity and the therapeutic use of digoxin are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dosing-regimen-for-digoxin-specific-antibody-fab-fragments-in-patients-with-digoxin-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dosing regimen for digoxin-specific antibody (Fab) fragments in patients with digoxin toxicity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-digoxin-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of digoxin in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Pharmacologic therapy&quot;, section on 'Digoxin'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-with-digoxin-initial-dosing-monitoring-and-dose-modification\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment with digoxin: Initial dosing, monitoring, and dose modification&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGY AND CELLULAR TOXICOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac glycosides all possess a steroid nucleus with an unsaturated lactone at the C17 position, and at least one glycosidic residue at the C3 position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65821\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65821 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Cardiac glycosides are used primarily to increase inotropy in cardiac myocytes but also affect cells in the vascular smooth muscle and sympathetic nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>Normal depolarization of the cardiac myocyte begins with the opening of the fast sodium channels. The resulting increase in intracellular sodium, and subsequent change in the resting membrane potential, opens voltage-gated calcium channels. The initial influx of calcium induces further release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which results in muscle contraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Sodium is then removed from the cell by, among several mechanisms, the sodium-potassium-ATPase. Some calcium is removed from the cell by the sodium-calcium antiporter.</p><p>Cardiac glycosides reversibly inhibit the sodium-potassium-ATPase, causing an increase in intracellular sodium and a decrease in intracellular potassium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. The increase in intracellular sodium prevents the sodium-calcium antiporter from expelling calcium from the myocyte, which increases intracellular calcium. The net increase in intracellular calcium augments inotropy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Cardiac glycosides also increase vagal tone, which results in decreased conduction through the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Excessive intracellular calcium may cause delayed after-depolarizations, which may in turn lead to premature contractions and trigger arrhythmias. Cardiac glycosides shorten repolarization of the atria and ventricles, decreasing the refractory period of the myocardium, thereby increasing automaticity and the risk for arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>The effects of cardiac glycosides on vasoconstriction can vary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Digitalis has been shown to reduce plasma renin concentrations in patients with advanced decompensated heart failure, causing peripheral vasodilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In patients without heart failure, digitalis can increase vasoconstriction. This difference is likely due to enhanced responsiveness of the baroreceptors in patients with chronic heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">KINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Digoxin</a> and digitoxin are the two cardiac glycosides available for clinical use. Important pharmacokinetic properties of these agents are presented in the attached table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60113\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60113 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>While mechanistically equivalent, these drugs have several different pharmacologic properties. Digitoxin is absorbed more readily and has a smaller volume of distribution, a longer half-life, and greater protein binding. In addition, digitoxin is hepatically cleared while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> is cleared renally.</p><p>Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> and digitoxin have a narrow therapeutic index and toxicity is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Furthermore, dosing adjustments must be made whenever significant alterations occur in factors affecting absorption, distribution, or elimination. Such factors are numerous and include changes in volume of distribution due to age or increased adipose stores, diminished protein binding from conditions causing hypoalbuminemia, and renal impairment resulting in decreased elimination.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Digoxin</a> is a substrate of intestinal and renal p-glycoprotein. P-glycoprotein is an efflux pump that excretes many drugs into the intestine or proximal renal tubule, thereby lowering serum concentrations. Drugs that alter p-glycoprotein activity can increase serum digoxin concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Examples of such drugs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73326\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73326 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>The molecular weight of both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> and digitoxin is large, making extracorporeal elimination ineffective for either agent. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Extracorporeal removal'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both pharmaceutical formulations and naturally occurring sources of cardiac glycosides can cause toxicity. Critical clinical manifestations of toxicity are usually cardiac but may include gastrointestinal and neurologic signs. The diagnosis of cardiac glycoside toxicity is based upon clinical and electrocardiographic manifestations rather than isolated elevated serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> concentrations. Presentation can vary depending upon whether toxicity is acute or chronic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determine the agent, amount taken, time of ingestion, and any coingestants whenever possible. The time is especially important because the serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> concentration ideally should be measured at least six hours after ingestion to ensure accuracy. A level drawn prematurely may be falsely elevated due to incomplete drug distribution. Determine also if the patient normally takes digitalis or if it was someone else's prescription. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Serum digoxin concentration'</a> below.)</p><p>Ask about symptoms suggesting an acute illness, such as gastroenteritis, that may have caused dehydration or acute renal insufficiency and contributed to the development of chronic toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Inquire carefully about gastrointestinal, cardiac, and neurologic manifestations, including visual disturbances, because these are the most common findings associated with chronic toxicity.</p><p>Inquire also about symptoms that suggest hypoperfusion, such as confusion and abdominal pain, which may stem from mesenteric ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intestinal-ischemia-in-adults#H1190364515\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intestinal ischemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Obtain a thorough medication history to determine if any recent additions or dosing changes were made. Several medications, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>, can increase serum digitalis concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73326\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73326 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After initial evaluation of the patient's airway and breathing, the clinician should assess the patient's vital signs. Bradycardia is frequently encountered in digitalis toxicity.</p><p>Look for evidence of hypoperfusion and end organ dysfunction. Pay particular attention to mentation and neurologic status, keeping in mind that such effects are often due to direct toxicity but may be secondary to cerebral hypoperfusion. Look for symptoms and signs suggestive of acute mesenteric ischemia, which is a rare complication. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intestinal-ischemia-in-adults#H1190364752\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intestinal ischemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In both acute and chronic digitalis toxicity, cardiac effects are of the greatest concern. The cardiac manifestations of digitalis toxicity can include virtually any type of arrhythmia with the exception of rapidly conducted atrial arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Digitalis-related arrhythmias are discussed below and separately. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiogram'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-arrhythmias-due-to-digoxin-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac arrhythmias due to digoxin toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other symptoms of acute and chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> toxicity may overlap, but a few important differences should be noted. With an acute ingestion, the patient may remain asymptomatic for several hours then develop significant gastrointestinal symptoms, such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Neurologic manifestations such as confusion and weakness, independent of hemodynamic parameters, are common. Electrolyte abnormalities occur with both acute and chronic toxicity and are discussed further below. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Electrolyte abnormalities'</a> below.)</p><p>Chronic toxicity is often more difficult to diagnose, as symptom onset tends to be more insidious and may occur over a period ranging from days to months. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, can occur but may be less pronounced. Neurologic manifestations, such as lethargy, fatigue, delirium, confusion, disorientation, and weakness, may be prominent in chronic toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Often patients are brought to medical attention by family members who note a change in mental status since their last visit, which may have been days, weeks, or even months prior.</p><p>Visual changes associated with digitalis toxicity are varied and may include alterations in color vision (chromatopsia), diplopia, photophobia, decreased visual acuity, photopsia, scotomas, or blindness. Chromatopsia, specifically xanthopsia (objects appear yellow), is classically associated with digitalis toxicity but is frequently absent and not needed for diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY AND ECG EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the patient with suspected <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> toxicity, the following studies should be obtained:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> concentration: For an acute overdose, obtain a serum concentration measurement on presentation and approximately six hours after the ingestion; for chronic toxicity, obtain a concentration on presentation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum potassium concentration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Creatinine and BUN to assess renal function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serial electrocardiograms (ECGs)</p><p/><p>In the setting of an intentional ingestion, the following studies should also be obtained:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fingerstick glucose, to rule out hypoglycemia as the cause of any alteration in mental status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetaminophen</a> and salicylate levels, to rule out these common coingestants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy test in women of childbearing age</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrolyte abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhibition of the sodium-potassium-ATPase, in both heart and skeletal muscle, leads to an increase in extracellular potassium. Thus, hyperkalemia is an important marker of acute digitalis toxicity, and a predictor of mortality. Other electrolyte abnormalities may also occur in the setting of digitalis poisoning. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacology and cellular toxicology'</a> above.)</p><p>In acute toxicity, the degree of hyperkalemia correlates with mortality. This was first shown in a classic study performed before the advent of antidotal therapy using digoxin-specific antibody (Fab) fragments. In this study of 91 patients primarily with acute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> poisoning from intentional overdose, researchers noted that no patient with an initial potassium concentration above 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (or <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> survived, while no patient with a potassium concentration below 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This correlation has also been demonstrated in plant cardiac glycoside ingestions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>In the setting of chronic toxicity, hypokalemia is of greater concern. Several electrolyte abnormalities, including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypercalcemia, increase patient susceptibility to the toxic effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Loop diuretics to treat heart failure are the most common cause of hypokalemia in these patients, but other causes of hypokalemia (eg, diarrhea or vomiting) do occur.</p><p>Renal dysfunction is commonly encountered in the setting of chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> toxicity and is often what precipitates the rise in the digoxin concentration. Therefore, assessment of renal function is essential and should include measurements of BUN and creatinine, as well as urine output to assess renal perfusion. The adjustments needed for digoxin dosing in the setting of renal insufficiency are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-with-digoxin-initial-dosing-monitoring-and-dose-modification#H4682340\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment with digoxin: Initial dosing, monitoring, and dose modification&quot;, section on 'Dose adjustments'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum digoxin concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The therapeutic window of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> is narrow, with substantial overlap between &ldquo;therapeutic&rdquo; and &ldquo;toxic&rdquo; serum concentrations (or levels), and the concentration can be affected by many factors (eg, impaired renal function, other medications). Therefore, determining an appropriate therapeutic serum digoxin concentration can be difficult. Issues related to the therapeutic serum concentration of digoxin are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-with-digoxin-initial-dosing-monitoring-and-dose-modification#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment with digoxin: Initial dosing, monitoring, and dose modification&quot;, section on 'Monitoring serum digoxin'</a>.)</p><p>A quantitative serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> concentration is readily measured in most hospital laboratories, which use a standard radioimmunoassay. The approximate therapeutic range for patients in heart failure is 0.5 to 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (0.65 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> with a typical immunoassay reference range being 0.8 to 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (1 to 2.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span>. Ideally, blood samples should be collected four hours after an intravenous dose or six hours after an oral dose in order to account for drug distribution and obtain an accurate measurement. The serum digoxin concentration is likely to be falsely elevated if the sample is obtained soon after administration or ingestion because of the time required to equilibrate through the large volume of distribution.</p><p>The serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> concentration does <strong>not</strong> necessarily correlate with toxicity. Numerous reports have described asymptomatic patients with a &quot;toxic&quot; level, while others described patients with significant toxicity despite a serum digoxin concentration in the therapeutic range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/22,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,26-28</a>].</p><p>Although they may not correlate with clinical manifestations of toxicity, serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> levels are used in some cases to determine the dosing of antidotal therapy with Fab fragments. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Antidotal therapy with antibody (Fab) fragments'</a> below.)</p><p>Although the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> immunoassay is specifically designed to measure digoxin, cross reactivity with other cardiac glycosides does occur. Consequently, patients poisoned with another cardiac glycoside, such as those found in various plant species, may have an elevated initial digoxin concentration. However, because cross reactivity is incomplete, an elevated digoxin concentration only confirms exposure in such instances and there is <strong>NO</strong> correlation between the numerical measurement and the degree of toxicity. Therefore, in this setting digoxin concentration should not be used to calculate antidotal therapy with Fab fragments.</p><p>Following the administration of Fab fragments, serum immunoassays of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> are unreliable, as they measure both bound and unbound drug. Fab treatment frequently causes an elevation in the measured digoxin concentration despite a free digoxin level approaching zero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Consequently, total digoxin levels should not be obtained or used clinically following Fab fragment administration. The measurement of &quot;free&quot; digoxin concentrations may be helpful in determining when a patient can restart digoxin, if desired. However, the free digoxin level may not be routinely available in some centers.</p><p>Elevated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> levels have been identified in pregnant women, newborns, and patients with acromegaly, subarachnoid hemorrhage, liver disease, and renal failure due to endogenous digoxin-like substances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The clinical significance of endogenous digoxin-like substances remains unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Digitalis toxicity can produce a range of cardiac arrhythmias, and rhythm disturbances may evolve and change rapidly. Thus, performing continuous cardiac monitoring and obtaining serial electrocardiograms (ECG) is important in the setting of toxicity. An ECG should be obtained upon presentation and repeated with any change in the patient's clinical condition or any significant alteration in the rhythm or waveform on the cardiac monitor.</p><p>Premature ventricular contractions are the most common rhythm disturbance caused by digitalis toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Others include bradycardia, atrial tachyarrhythmias with AV block, ventricular bigeminy, junctional rhythms, various degrees of AV nodal blockade, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation. Bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, while not pathognomonic for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> toxicity, is encountered in rare instances; digoxin is one of only a few xenobiotics known to produce this arrhythmia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71796\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef71796 \">waveform 1</a>).</p><p>Ventricular arrhythmias are reportedly more common in chronic toxicity and in patients with chronic heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A detailed description of the arrhythmias caused by digitalis is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-arrhythmias-due-to-digoxin-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac arrhythmias due to digoxin toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The so-called &quot;digitalis effect&quot; on the ECG consists of T wave changes (flattening or inversion), QT interval shortening, scooped ST segments with ST depression in the lateral leads, and increased amplitude of the U waves.

Following an acute overdose, the patient may remain asymptomatic for several hours and then manifest a number of symptoms and signs, including cardiac (arrhythmia), gastrointestinal (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain), and neurologic findings (confusion, weakness, delirium). The cardiac manifestations of digitalis toxicity can include virtually any type of arrhythmia, with the exception of rapidly conducted atrial arrhythmias. Hyperkalemia is an important marker of and prognostic indicator for acute toxicity. Chronic toxicity is often more difficult to diagnose, as symptom onset tends to be more insidious and digoxin concentrations may be minimally elevated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33651379\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poisoning with beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and alpha agonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a>) can present in a similar fashion to digitalis toxicity, with bradycardia and hypotension being prominent features. An elevated serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> concentration distinguishes digitalis poisoning. In addition, significant toxicity from calcium channel blockers generally produces hyperglycemia.

Following the acute ingestion of an unknown amount of digitalis, empiric treatment consists of 10 vials of digoxin Fab fragments for adults or 5 vials for children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. One vial binds approximately 0.5 mg of digoxin. The indications for treatment are described below.

However, some advocate giving Fab fragments if the serum digoxin concentration is greater than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (13 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> at steady state in acute ingestions, or greater than 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (5.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> in chronic ingestions, or when an adult ingests more than 10 mg or a child more than 4 mg acutely.</p><p>Cross reactivity exists between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> and other cardiac glycosides. Therefore, digoxin-specific antibodies can be used to treat poisoning involving cardiac glycosides from both plants and animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/24,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,35,36</a>]. However, the dosing of Fab fragments should be done empirically in such cases because the degree of toxicity in naturally occurring cardiac glycosides does not correlate with the serum digoxin concentration. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Serum digoxin concentration'</a> above.)</p><p>The advent of digoxin-specific antibody (Fab) fragments occurred in 1976 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/26,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,37</a>]. Evidence for the benefit of Fab fragments is found in the many case series that have appeared since that time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/33,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,38</a>]. Prior to the development of this treatment, the management of digitalis overdose was difficult and often resulted in life-threatening arrhythmias.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with pacemakers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It may be impossible to determine the underlying cardiac rhythm and thereby detect early signs of digitalis toxicity in patients with pacemakers. The ECG in such patients may demonstrate a paced rhythm without ventricular ectopy or bradyarrhythmia despite the presence of moderate to severe digitalis toxicity. We suggest treating these patients with digoxin-specific antibody fragments if the serum potassium concentration is above 5 to 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> [&gt;5 to 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]</span> or clinical symptoms are significant (eg, encephalopathy) or progressing.

The standard dose is 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> (maximum 50 g). The decision to administer AC should be made after ensuring that the patient is alert and adequately protecting their airway. We do <strong>not</strong> advocate insertion of a nasogastric tube in a nonintubated patient solely for the purpose of administering AC. AC is unlikely to benefit patients with chronic digitalis toxicity.</p><p>Cardiac glycosides undergo some degree of enterohepatic or enteroenteric recirculation and are adsorbed to activated charcoal. However, there are mixed clinical data regarding the efficacy of AC or multi-dose AC (MDAC) in the setting of yellow oleander poisoning: One randomized trial found a reduction in mortality with AC administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], while another did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>When Fab fragments are not readily available, AC or MDAC are reasonable interventions in patients with yellow oleander poisoning, although their efficacy remains unclear. The extrapolation of data from studies of yellow oleander poisoning to poisonings with other glycosides (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>) should be made with caution. Most importantly, neither AC nor MDAC should ever be considered an alternative to Fab fragment therapy for any cardiac glycoside poisoning when Fab fragments are available. Fab fragment therapy remains the essential treatment for digitalis poisoning.

However, hyperkalemia itself does not cause death, and treatment with potassium-lowering agents such as insulin and dextrose, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>, or ion exchange resins does <strong>not</strong> reduce mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Once treatment with digoxin-specific antibody (Fab) fragments is instituted, hyperkalemia is rapidly corrected as the regenerated sodium-potassium ATPase pumps potassium back into cells. Thus, aggressive treatment with potassium-lowering agents could cause significant <strong>hypo</strong>kalemia following antidotal therapy.</p><p>If a patient with digitalis poisoning is hypokalemic, potassium should be administered since hypokalemia exacerbates digitalis toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The need for potassium repletion is particularly important for patients who are to be treated with Fab fragments, because this treatment leads to a further reduction in the serum potassium. Many hypokalemic patients are simultaneously hypomagnesemic and should be given magnesium as well. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of hypokalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It has been taught that calcium should not be given to patients with digitalis toxicity for the treatment of hyperkalemia. This teaching is based primarily upon five published cases dating back to 1933. Of these five cases, only three patients had a temporal association between calcium administration and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>].

However, the serum calcium levels in these studies exceeded 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> before increased toxicity occurred.

In addition, a large retrospective series of patients with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> toxicity found no ill effects attributable to the administration of calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Nonetheless, because hyperkalemia is not the cause of death and excessive intracellular calcium is present in digitalis poisoning, we do <strong>not</strong> recommend routine administration of calcium in hyperkalemic patients with recognized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> toxicity.
