Many of these features of FTT are actually defined as features of frailty including weight loss, malnutrition, and inactivity. In geriatric practice, FTT describes a syndrome of global decline that occurs in older adults as a worsening of physical frailty that is frequently compounded by cognitive impairment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> functional disability. FTT describes a point further along a geriatric functional continuum that is closer to full dependence and death, with &quot;frailty as a mid-point between independence and pre-death&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The term FTT has long been used in pediatrics to describe infants who are unable to gain weight and have physical and cognitive developmental impairments and depressive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Pediatric patients with FTT have not achieved their expected functional level, while elders with FTT are unable to maintain their functional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; the symptom complex is similar at both ends of the age spectrum.</p><p>FTT describes the late stages of decline and may represent a final common pathway toward death. The goal in evaluation and management of FTT is to identify contributing factors that can be modified or reversed, such as assistance with meals to improve nutrition or treatment of infection that may lead to premature death, while keeping in mind the patient and family&rsquo;s goals and wishes. Some authors cite concerns that the terminology &quot;failure to thrive&quot; impedes appropriate patient evaluation and management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and its use has fallen out of favor. However, we find it a useful term to describe a clinical syndrome encompassing frailty, disability, and neuropsychiatric impairment.</p><p>Due to the difficulty in precisely defining FTT as a syndrome in clinical practice, data are limited regarding its incidence, epidemiology, and outcomes. The individual components associated with FTT, however, are clearly predictive of mortality.</p><p>This topic will discuss an overview of the evaluation of patients with suspected FTT. Management of older patients with FTT is discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Failure to thrive in elderly adults: Management&quot;</a>), as are discussions cited below on individual components of FTT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPONENTS OF FTT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Failure to thrive (FTT) may be considered to result from interaction of three components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical frailty</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired neuropsychiatric function</p><p/><p>Major contributors to decompensation are medication side effects, medical comorbidities, and psychosocial factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82609\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82609 \">figure 1</a>). The key feature that must be present in FTT is frailty, which includes weight loss, malnutrition, and physical inactivity. The elements in this model are commonly seen in patients with FTT; however, all factors are not required to yield a state of functional and medical decline consistent with FTT. For example, an older patient with cancer, weight loss, frailty, and functional decline or disability may have FTT without any element of neuropsychiatric impairment. Another example may be a patient with advanced dementia with increasing disability, frailty, and weight loss due to consequences of the dementia process. In contrast, a patient with a chronic disability and dementia may not have FTT because he does not have physical frailty or weight loss and be at a stable functional level.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Frailty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Frailty, representing decreased physiologic reserve affecting multiple systems, is a vulnerable state for future adverse health outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Frailty is most often identified when aging and disease lead to a critical mass of deficits, resulting in impaired physical function and malnutrition or weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

It has also been associated with decline in activities of daily living (ADLs), increased hospital complications, admissions to nursing homes, and poorer quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Unintentional weight loss has been shown to have a negative effect on functional decline regardless of baseline BMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Normal aging is associated with small amounts of weight loss per year, approximately 0.1 to 0.2 kg per year after age 70 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This slow weight loss is associated with an increased ratio of fat to lean body mass. Physiologic changes with aging, such as decreased olfactory sensitivity, are felt to increase anorexia and promote weight loss.</p><p>Although the frailty phenotype includes weight loss, obese elders may also be considered frail by meeting the other criteria for the frailty phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Even if weight loss is not apparent, the patient should be evaluated for evidence of malnutrition.</p><p>Causes of weight loss may broadly be divided into two categories: inadequate intake and increased energy expenditure. Many elders, especially those in nursing homes, lack adequate intake of calories and nutrients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis for the etiology of weight loss and malnutrition in elders is extensive and includes medical conditions, medications, and socioeconomic factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54156\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54156 \">table 1</a>). Poor oral health and dry mouth are risk factors for decreased oral intake due to changes in taste and difficulty with chewing and swallowing.</p><p>Medications that are most commonly associated with weight loss in older adults are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68249\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68249 \">table 2</a>). The list of associated medical diagnoses is the same as for FTT, with malignancy the most common cause of involuntary weight loss and the most common medical diagnosis in case-series of patients admitted with FTT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59323\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59323 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Neuromuscular function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several physiologic changes with age affect neuromuscular function, including decreases in skeletal muscle mass and strength (sarcopenia), aerobic capacity, and forced expiratory volume. These changes reduce the physiologic reserve and increase vulnerability to stressors.</p><p>A cycle of frailty has been described in which malnutrition associated with frailty adds to age-related loss of lean muscle mass or sarcopenia. This contributes to loss of strength, decreased aerobic capacity, decreased walking speed, and, ultimately, significant disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency is common in both community-dwelling and institutionalized elders and has been associated with falls and gait imbalance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Additionally, low serum 25 (OH) vitamin D is associated with an increased risk for nursing home admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Screening for disability involves asking about activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).</p><p>The Katz ADL scale assesses basic life skills: the patient's ability to bathe, dress, toilet themselves, transfer, feed themselves, and maintain continence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66451\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66451 \">table 4</a>). The Lawton IADL scale is intended for use in community-dwelling elders to identify their current level of independent living skills and how those abilities change over time. It assesses activities required to live independently: using the telephone, shopping and using transportation, preparing meals, doing housework, and managing finances and medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63647\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63647 \">table 5</a>).</p><p>Physical disability is common in older adults. In the 1996 National Health Interview Survey, approximately 20 to 30 percent of community-dwelling elders reported disability in mobility, IADLs, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ADLs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Many adults, however, can compensate for any disabilities and thrive. Additionally, disability is often reversible <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Disability is not synonymous with frailty or with FTT.</p><p>Disability may develop slowly due to progressive comorbidities and frailty, or acutely due to catastrophic events (eg, stroke). Disability is an independent risk factor for mortality, hospitalization, and need for long-term care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuropsychiatric impairment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delirium, depression, and dementia are the most common conditions impairing cognitive status in older adults. The evaluation of any patient with FTT should include attention to the signs or symptoms of delirium, dementia, and depression. These conditions may result from medical comorbidities and medication effects; each may also contribute to the development of disability, malnutrition, and frailty.</p><p>Dementia and depression were among the five leading causes of FTT in a case series of inpatients admitted with FTT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Another case series of FTT admissions found &quot;nervous and mental disorders&quot; to account for 13 percent of the discharge diagnoses, and 54 percent were found to have cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Delirium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delirium is defined as an acute disorder of attention and global cognitive function and is commonly seen in hospitalized patients with FTT, since delirium and FTT have overlapping risk factors. Dementia, sensory impairments, severe illness, depression, volume depletion, and medical comorbidities greatly increase the risk for delirium. The presence of delirium adds to the patient's in-hospital morbidity and mortality and complicates the evaluation of FTT by impairing the clinical team's ability to assess for dementia and depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Dementia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of dementia increases rapidly with age, doubling every decade between the seventh and ninth. Some studies have reported an incidence of dementia as high as 42 percent in seniors &ge;85 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Unintentional weight loss has been reported in up to 50 percent of nursing home elders with dementia and approximately 30 percent of non-institutionalized patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Patients with FTT and dementia may require additional workup for undetected disease due to the patient's inability to communicate well or lack of insight into their symptoms. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depression can be a sole cause, or one of many contributors, to FTT. Depression may lead to disability, malnutrition, and weight loss. Rates of all-cause mortality are higher among elders with depression than their non-depressed counterparts. Depression is common in older adults, with incidence rates ranging from 5 percent in the community to 25 percent in the nursing home population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. All patients with the FTT syndrome should be assessed for depression.

It is also important to try to determine the time of onset of functional deficits and the tempo of decline.</p><p>An assessment of weight loss and malnutrition involves verification of change in weight and body mass index (BMI). A dietary history should include the patient&rsquo;s access to food, number of daily meals, amount of food eaten, need for assistance with eating, difficulty with chewing, and symptoms of anorexia, early satiety, and dysphagia. It is also extremely helpful to observe the patient eating or try to obtain observational reports.</p><p>The Simplified Nutritional Assessment Questionnaires (SNAQ) are a set of three simple tools intended for use in the hospital, nursing homes, and with community dwelling elders to screen for anorexia, malnutrition, and to predict future weight loss. The tools and validation studies are available at www.fightmalnutrition.eu [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

It is important to ask about somatic complaints associated with depression, including loss of appetite, poor sleep, fatigue, and poor concentration. Somatic symptoms of depression may be difficult to separate from those of medical illness, and referral to a psychiatrist or geriatrician is often helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-late-life-unipolar-depression\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of late-life unipolar depression&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Caregivers should be asked about patient problems with memory, including repetition of questions, difficulty with handling finances, getting lost in the community, car accidents, and participation in usual activities.</p><p>A social history should include information about the patient's social network and family supports, living situation, financial resources, education, degree of isolation, and recent deaths or losses. Social isolation is a risk factor for institutionalization and death in elders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Social vulnerability was independently associated with increased mortality and increased levels of frailty in a study of two large cohorts of older adults in Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Elder mistreatment and neglect is common, and clinicians should be alert for signs of these conditions.

Red flags for possible elder abuse include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substance abuse among caregivers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited social supports</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavioral changes in the presence of the caregiver</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained injuries</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to fill medication prescriptions</p><p/><p>The patient should be questioned privately about mistreatment. Interviewing the suspected abuser is more difficult and may require help from providers with experience in this area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination is used to determine and document the level of physical and cognitive impairment, as well as to look for signs of disease that might lead to impairment. Particular interest should be paid to the following components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vital signs &ndash; Including weight and height, and orthostatic blood pressure measurements (heart rate and blood pressure measured supine and standing at one and three minutes)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HEENT exam &ndash; Complete oral cavity examination for signs of dental abscess, dental caries, poorly fitting dentures, or thrush.

The patient is asked to rise from a seated position not using his arms, walk 10 feet, turn, and return to the chair to sit. Normal time to complete the test is 7 to 10 seconds; those who require greater than 10 seconds may be at higher risk for falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Patients who can complete the test in 20 seconds or less are generally independent for basic transfers and able to leave the house unattended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Mental status testing should start with an evaluation for attention. If attention is impaired, a workup for delirium should be initiated. The evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia is discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68789\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef68789 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory and other studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The suspicion of specific disease states developed through the history and physical exam should guide the selection of tests to be ordered. Initial tests should screen for sources of infection, organ failure, and malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Basic laboratory studies to be drawn on all patients with FTT include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CBC with differential</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basic metabolic panel (electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, glucose)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver function studies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinalysis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcium, phosphate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TSH</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin B12 and folate levels</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Albumin and total cholesterol (the most definitive markers of malnutrition)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>25 (OH) vitamin D (if history of falls)</p><p/><p>Additionally, a chest radiograph can assess for tuberculosis, other occult infections, or malignancy. An electrocardiogram may detect silent myocardial infarction or arrhythmia.</p><p>An erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C reactive protein (CRP) level may be considered looking for polymyalgia rheumatica, chronic infection, or malignancy. If risk factors are present, one should consider blood cultures and serologic testing for HIV and syphilis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Consultants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Speech therapists and dietitians can help in the evaluation of unexplained weight loss or malnutrition. Speech therapy may distinguish whether poor oral intake relates to difficulty with swallowing coordination (dementia or stroke), difficulty with chewing (poor dentition or periodontal infection), or difficulty with aspiration. The speech therapy evaluation may lead to therapeutic interventions involving appropriate food textures, positioning, and swallowing techniques. A dietitian can perform a detailed analysis of the patient's current caloric intake and caloric needs for their activity level and illness, leading to therapeutic suggestions.</p><p>The patient with FTT should also be evaluated by physical and occupational therapy. Physical therapy can assess and advise regarding use of appropriate assistive devices, grab bars and other home safety tools, and rehabilitation therapy. Occupational therapy can evaluate the patient's ability to perform activities of daily living and assist in a cognitive evaluation, recommending appropriate therapy and safety interventions.</p><p>A skilled social worker can work with families to address social isolation. Social work interventions may include family and patient education regarding dementia and end-of-life issues, referral to community resources, and counseling for depression and bereavement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to thrive (FTT) in older adults is a syndrome of global decline, often associated with physical frailty, functional disability, and neuropsychiatric impairment. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frailty is defined by the features of weight loss, exhaustion, weakness, slow gait, and decreased physical activity. Medications, medical comorbidities, and socioeconomic factors often play a role (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68249\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68249 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59323\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59323 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Frailty'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disability is difficulty in performing tasks necessary for self-care (ADLs) and independent living (IADLs). Many adults can compensate for their disability, which is not synonymous with frailty or with FTT. Neuropsychiatric impairment commonly relates to one of three conditions: delirium, dementia, or depression. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Disability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The history should be obtained from the patient and his or her caregivers. In addition to a complete history and review of symptoms, the clinician should explore timing of symptom onset and progression, prescription and over the counter medication use, substance abuse, functional status, depression and cognitive issues, and social history. Signs of elder mistreatment and neglect should be kept in mind. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A comprehensive medical examination should be supplemented by the &quot;Get up and go test,&quot; mental status testing, and office-based screening for hearing and vision. Laboratory investigations should be based on suspected underlying diseases. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory and other studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multidisciplinary team approach is recommended for patient assessment and might include a speech therapist, dietitian, physical therapist, occupational therapist, and social worker. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Consultants'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Sarkisian CA, Lachs MS. &quot;Failure to thrive&quot; in older adults.
