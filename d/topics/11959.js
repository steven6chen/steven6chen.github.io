These symptoms can result in loss of appetite, reduced nutrient intake, altered nutrient metabolism, and ultimately impaired nutritional status. Loss of appetite is most likely the result of inflammation and the release of cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor.</p><p>Dietary interventions in IBD focus on maximizing nutritional status, maintaining adequate intake, and avoiding foods that can exacerbate symptoms.</p><p>The prevalence of nutritional deficiencies and malnutrition has been well documented in IBD, especially in Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is important to identify patients who are malnourished in order to identify those patients who may require nutritional intervention. Optimizing nutritional status is important both to prevent long-term health consequences of malnutrition as well as to prevent relapses in patients with IBD.</p><p>This topic review will discuss nutrition and dietary interventions in adults with inflammatory bowel disease. Specific nutrient deficiencies in IBD, as well as growth failure and poor weight gain in children with IBD, are discussed separately. Dietary risk factors for IBD are also discussed separately.

Measuring a patient's nutritional status involves a comprehensive assessment. This may include measuring body composition, dietary intake, energy expenditure, body function, and serum protein markers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-assessment-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary assessment in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Relying exclusively on serum protein levels (eg, albumin and prealbumin) as definitive markers of nutrition is insufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].<strong> </strong>Albumin is a better predictor of a patient's clinical outcome in the hospital than of nutritional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Specific micronutrient (vitamin and mineral) deficiencies may also occur in patients with IBD depending upon their general nutritional status as well as the activity and location of their disease. These can be assessed by specific laboratory measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrient-deficiencies-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrient deficiencies in inflammatory bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Laboratory measures'</a>.)</p><p>Global assessment tools should be used as part of standard nutrition screening to identify at-risk, malnourished patients. One of these tools is a subjective global assessment (SGA) analysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63581\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef63581 \">form 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This global assessment tool takes into account multiple nutrition-related factors including functional status, dietary factors, multiple GI-related symptoms, weight loss, and a brief physical examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-assessment-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary assessment in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The SGA is a useful tool and has been used in conjunction with measuring body mass index (BMI), albumin, and trace elements in assessing the nutritional status of IBD patients. However, in one study, patients with IBD who were well nourished according to this standard nutrition screening were found to have a decrease in body cell mass (a measure of metabolically active tissues) as well as reduced handgrip strength compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A separate study documented that patients with Crohn disease in remission often had a normal BMI (weight in <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/height</span> in meters) but reduced handgrip muscle strength consistent with loss of protein muscle mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These observations suggest that IBD patients may look well or even exhibit excess weight while having alterations in body composition and body function, and as a result, may be candidates for nutritional supplementation as well. Therefore, it is prudent to ensure that all patients with IBD are assessed for adequacy of their nutritional status.

The evaluation and management of growth failure in children with IBD is discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth failure and poor weight gain in children with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H619619406\"><span class=\"h2\">Weight loss and reduced muscle mass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weight loss and protein-calorie malnutrition have become less common among adults with IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/5,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12,13</a>]. Historically, nutritional deficiencies or the inability to maintain ideal body weight occurred in 50 to 70 percent of adults with CD, and 18 to 62 percent of those with ulcerative colitis (UC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. A 2009 study of 102 adults with IBD found 14 percent of those with CD and 5.7 percent of those with UC to be malnourished based upon body mass index (BMI) criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, muscle mass depletion was detected in more than half of the patients.</p><p>Muscle and fat mass depletion is associated with disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Adult patients with CD in remission usually have no differences in body composition compared with healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>The primary mediators of reduced muscle mass are inflammation (excessive catabolism, which accelerates protein breakdown), decreased physical activity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glucocorticoid treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Inadequate protein intake may also affect muscle mass, but this mechanism is not usually relevant in adults unless the deficiency is severe and prolonged (starvation). The protein intake of children with IBD is more likely to be insufficient because of their relatively high protein needs for growth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-failure-and-poor-weight-gain-in-children-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth failure and poor weight gain in children with inflammatory bowel disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients who have lost between 5 and 10 percent of their lean body mass usually have no clinical sequelae. However, loss of lean body mass beyond this threshold is associated with increased morbidity. As an example, reduced muscle mass is associated with poor wound healing and higher rates of infection after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5475741\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone disease (osteoporosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> osteomalacia) is a common problem in IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Its cause is probably multifactorial.

Clinical studies in this area are small in number, often not randomized or placebo-controlled, and contain small numbers of patients. Still, there are some conclusions we can draw from this body of literature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H642207260\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutrition supplementation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nutrition supplementation is the administration of commercially available supplements to increase calorie and protein intake. Oral ingestion is the preferred method of delivery, although tube feedings (nasogastric or nasoduodenal) are used when volitional oral intake is inadequate. Liquid nutritional supplementation may take the form of an elemental, semi-elemental, or polymeric diet. Each consists of liquid nutrients in an easily assimilated form, differing in their protein source; elemental (free amino acids), semi-elemental (oligopeptides), and polymeric (whole protein). The diet selected is usually based on individual preferences, individual tolerance, availability, and cost. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-enteral-nutrition#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Enteral nutrition&quot;, section on 'Formulations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview#H935222\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: An overview&quot;, section on 'Enteral nutrition'</a>.)</p><p>Enteral nutrition (liquid food delivered orally or via tube feeding) in addition to normal food is indicated in malnourished patients with IBD to improve nutritional status. In addition, enteral feeding has some efficacy in inducing remission in patients with active Crohn disease (CD), although glucocorticoids appear to have superior efficacy. Prior to the approval of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> for induction of remission in fistulizing CD, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism guidelines recommended enteral nutrition be used as therapy in active CD, primarily when treatment with glucocorticoids is not feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. A systematic review showed that there was no difference in the induction of remission in CD when different formula compositions (elemental, semi-elemental, and polymeric) were compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A non-significant trend favoring very low-fat <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> long-chain triglyceride content was also found, but remains to be confirmed. Further analysis of six trials found that glucocorticoid therapy was more effective for inducing remission of active CD than was enteral nutrition.</p><p>Supplemental enteral therapy may also be effective in maintaining remission in CD, but this has not been definitively established. It is postulated that an oral supplement reduces exposure to the antigenic properties of normal food while boosting caloric intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

In patients receiving enteral nutrition, it involves introducing one new food at a time to identify foods that precipitate IBD symptoms. Many patients can identify foods that they believe may precipitate or worsen their disease and it is reasonable for them to avoid such foods. Using an elimination diet to identify at-risk foods may decrease the possibility of a &quot;flare&quot; of IBD.</p><p>Three studies provide support for this treatment approach.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One trial compared the use of glucocorticoids versus an elimination diet in 78 patients who had achieved a remission of their IBD flare by the use of an elemental diet feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].<strong> </strong>Patients were instructed to introduce one new food group daily and to avoid foods that they knew previously resulted in precipitating their IBD symptoms.

There is no recommendation from any major healthcare society supporting this intervention and there is little literature in this arena. One study randomized 204 patients with CD in remission to omega-3 fatty acids, a placebo, or a low-carbohydrate diet. In an intent-to-treat analysis, neither the omega-3 fatty acid supplementation nor the low-carbohydrate diet resulted in any improvement in relapse as compared to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) is a very restrictive low-carbohydrate diet that has been promoted for multiple chronic and autoimmune diseases, including IBD, autism, and celiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The diet is built upon the premise that intestinal microbes that contribute to the development of IBD use carbohydrates as their primary energy source, leading to the production of acids and toxins that can injure the small intestine, further impairing carbohydrate digestion and absorption.

It also limits the intake of some legumes and tubers and it does not allow for the intake of processed foods due to additives. The diet does allow for the intake of unprocessed meats, poultry, fish, eggs, honey, non-canned vegetables, some legumes, fruits, nuts, homemade yogurt, and some lower-lactose cheeses (eg, cheddar).</p><p>The data on the SCD are limited to a case report of two patients who improved on the diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-and-dietary-interventions-in-adults-with-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>] and many patients find the diet difficult to follow due to its restrictive nature.
