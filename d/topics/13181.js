Each type of hemodialysis vascular access has advantages and disadvantages, and specific access types are appropriate for certain individuals. There is general agreement that the best vascular access for the dialysis patient is a functioning arteriovenous (AV) fistula. However, this is not possible in all patients and in some patients is not the most appropriate choice. </p><p>The decision as to the type of vascular access that is appropriate for an individual patient is a complex one. Among the issues that affect the decision include the patient's medical status (stage of CKD, life expectancy, presence of comorbidities, psychologic concerns, etc.), anatomic considerations (availability of suitable vessels, presence of arterial disease), and if <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> is already on hemodialysis using a tunneled dialysis catheter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arteriovenous-fistula-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arteriovenous fistula creation for hemodialysis and its complications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arteriovenous graft creation for hemodialysis and its complications&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H595366564\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patient in preparation for the placement of a dialysis access is extremely important. Proper patient selection will materially enhance the opportunity to place the proper access type in the proper patient. This evaluation should be detailed and complete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Such an evaluation should be composed of several components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical history</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>General medical history</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Assessment of risk factors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>General physical examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Examination to detect pathology that might adversely affect access placement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular mapping</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2789990193\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In obtaining a medical history from the patient, emphasis should be placed upon aspects that might affect the placement of the vascular access as well as determining <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> overall general medical status. A prior history of the insertion of central venous catheters, peripherally inserted venous or arterial catheters, and the placement of any type of cardiac rhythm device with transvenous leads should be sought. A history of any previous dialysis vascular access placements needs to be elicited. Also, a planned kidney transplant at an early date can affect some of the decisions concerning vascular access that need to be made. &#160;</p><p>Careful attention should be paid to the detection and evaluation of the severity of risk factors for vascular access placement. The advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) population frequently has multiple comorbidities that can influence decisions related to vascular access (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity,</span> sex, cardiac disease, vascular disease, and pulmonary hypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A history of coronary or peripheral vascular disease can also affect decisions concerning vascular access placement. A history of malignancy, congestive heart disease, or severe coronary artery disease might have implications concerning the patient's life expectancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula#H60136735\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary failure of the hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure#H549425723\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodialysis arteriovenous graft dysfunction and failure&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula failure&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2166270312\"><span class=\"h2\">General physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both a general physical examination and a focused examination directed toward the vasculature used for access creation are important. Special emphasis should be placed on physical aspects that might affect the placement of the vascular access; special attention should be given to an evaluation of the risk factors. Issues requiring special attention include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any physical evidence (scars) from prior central venous access or hemodialysis catheters should be documented (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110396\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110396 \">picture 1</a>). In most but not all instances, the patient will give a positive access history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The presence of other scars indicating prior neck or thoracic surgery or trauma should also be noted and may raise the possibility of anatomic distortions that might affect venous anatomy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient's chest, breast, and upper arms should be evaluated for the presence of swelling or collateral veins. In patients with normal venous pressure, central venous occlusion may not be associated with swelling; however, the presence of collateral veins should alert the examiner to the problem. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central vein stenosis associated with hemodialysis access&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of a permanent cardiac pacemaker or similar device should be noted. The wires associated with such devices rank high on the list of etiologies of central vein stenosis. It is important to avoid ipsilateral transvenous pacemakers and hemodialysis access. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central vein stenosis associated with hemodialysis access&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2001227541\"><span class=\"h2\">Side of access</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2090964872\"><span class=\"h3\">Handedness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The handedness of the individual should be noted. If possible, creating an AV access in the nondominant arm is preferred. During dialysis, the arm with the access will need to be immobile. Having the dominant arm free during the treatment allows patients to engage in activities involving their hand in a more convenient manner. Nevertheless, using the most optimal vessels for the creation of (ideally) an AV fistula takes precedence. In some centers, vascular evaluation is routinely performed bilaterally. In others, the nondominant arm is evaluated first and, if optimal vessels are present, the dominant arm is not evaluated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1397618892\"><span class=\"h3\">Other considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regardless of handedness, an AV access is better suited contralateral to abnormalities of the proximal extremity arterial circulation. Coronary artery steal syndrome has been reported with AV access ipsilateral to inferior mammary artery to coronary bypass graft. Similarly, the patient with subclavian stenosis may develop symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2756697534\"><span class=\"h1\">VASCULAR MAPPING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term vascular mapping refers to the study and evaluation of the vessels (both arterial and venous) in preparation for the creation of a vascular access. In general, these studies are confined to the upper extremity. Vascular mapping should be performed in all patients prior to the placement of an access. Routine preoperative mapping results in a marked increase in placement of AV fistulas, as well as an improvement in the adequacy of forearm fistulas for dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>]. Arterial anatomy is of obvious importance; however, if there is a vascular problem that is going to interfere with the creation of an arteriovenous (AV) fistula, it is more likely to be venous than arterial. Evaluation of both is important to success.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2404404127\"><span class=\"h2\">Arterial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of the arterial evaluation are to identify an artery for the inflow of the AV access that is capable of delivering blood flow at a rate adequate to support hemodialysis. The use of the chosen artery must not jeopardize the viability of the digits and hand. </p><p>The arterial evaluation generally includes pulse examination, differential blood pressure measurement, and the Allen test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In special situations, imaging or other physiologic studies (eg, reactive hyperemia) may be appropriate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110395\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110395 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2981495152\"><span class=\"h3\">Arterial pulses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The axillary, brachial, radial, and ulnar pulses should be examined in both upper extremities to assure that the vessels are patent. A handheld bidirectional Doppler device is very useful for this purpose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76440\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76440 \">picture 2</a>). The quality of these pulses should be scored as either normal (2+), diminished (1+), or absent (0). If a pulse is not palpable, the patient should be referred for a noninvasive vascular imaging, typically duplex ultrasonography. (See <a href=\"#H61222649\" class=\"local\">'Arterial imaging'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3947567721\"><span class=\"h3\">Differential blood pressures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Differences in blood pressure between the two arms (measured sequentially) should be recorded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. A difference of &ge;10 mmHg suggests the possibility of subclavian, brachial, or proximal axillary artery stenosis (vessels above the level of the cuff) in the extremity with the lower pressure. The evaluation and treatment of upper extremity arterial disease is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease#H146789830\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive diagnosis of arterial disease&quot;, section on 'Upper extremity segmental pressures'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>If there is a suspicion for subclavian stenosis, there are two options: move to the opposite arm or initiate a more detailed evaluation of the arterial anatomy with the goal of making a definitive diagnosis and treating the problem while considering dialysis access options in that arm. The choice depends upon the circumstances of the individual case. A combination of both may be appropriate in some cases. It should be noted that since the arterial disease that results in a subclavian lesion is generally systemic, the arm with the higher systolic pressure may also be affected as well. Failure to recognize this early presents a risk for the development of hand ischemia following the creation of an ipsilateral dialysis access. (See <a href=\"#H61222649\" class=\"local\">'Arterial imaging'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1586576450\"><span class=\"h3\">Allen test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Allen test (or, more accurately stated, the modified Allen test) is used to evaluate the blood supply of the hand. The presence of an optimally functioning dual circulation to the hand, as represented by the radial and ulnar arteries communicating distally through the superficial and deep palmar arches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F55221\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55221 \">figure 2</a>), is an important safeguard against hand ischemia. When the radial artery is used for the AV access, a normal and patent ulnar artery can usually support the perfusion of the hand. </p><p>We suggest using pulse oximetry as an aid to the Allen test as this makes the test objective increase in effectiveness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110397\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110397 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. To perform this evaluation, the pulse oximetry probe should be placed on the patient's index finger. Then, the ulnar and radial arteries should be compressed. The loss of the pulse oximeter waveform is an objective indication that compression is adequate. Subsequent return of a pulse wave following the release of the ulnar artery indicates a negative test (ie, a patent ulnar artery). The test can then be repeated with release of the radial artery to demonstrate its patency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. If the radial artery is not patent, then a distal radial artery-based fistula is obviously not possible. If the ulnar artery is dysfunctional, the risk for hand ischemia due to steal is high if the radial artery is used. In these cases, attention should similarly be turned to the opposite arm. When performed with the aid of a pulse oximeter or vascular Doppler, the Allen test has been found to be reliable in 95 to 100 percent of patients being evaluated for future hemodialysis access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2657954772\"><span class=\"h2\">Reactive hyperemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perhaps more important than the diameter of the artery is its functional capacity (ie, its ability to dilate and accommodate the increased blood flow demands of an AV fistula). Reactive hyperemia testing has been advocated as having predictive value for the development of a successful AV fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. </p><p>The reactive hyperemia test is performed by first obtaining a spectral Doppler waveform of the arterial blood flow and then comparing it with one obtained after the patient has clenched his or her fist very tightly for two minutes (some have used three minutes). Normally, the Doppler waveform should change from triphasic high-resistance flow to one that is biphasic, indicating low-resistance flow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110398\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef110398 \">waveform 1</a>). This effect is mediated by nitric oxide released from the endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>One early study reported that a lack of an appropriate reaction after unclenching the fist was significantly associated with increased rates of primary AV fistula failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Later, the same author reported that comparison of the resistive index (RI) before and after the test (as a ratio of RI with reactive hyperemia to RI at rest) improved the predictability of the test, where RI was defined as [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">RI = (peak systolic velocity) - (lowest diastolic velocity) <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> (peak systolic velocity) </p></div></div><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a group of 116 patients, the rate of successful AV fistula creation was higher for an RI ratio (reactive <span class=\"nowrap\">hyperemia/rest)</span> that was &le;0.70 compared with &gt;0.70 (95 versus 39 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p>In another report, the hyperemic response was elicited by inflating a blood pressure cuff placed on the upper arm to 20 mmHg above the systolic pressure for three minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The response in the artery being evaluated was measured by subtracting the peak systolic velocity (PSV) at rest from the PSV obtained after the period of ischemia. The hyperemic response was recorded for both brachial and radial arteries. They concluded that an AV fistula created using an artery with a hyperemic response that is less than a 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/second</span> increase in PSV was twice as likely to fail as was one created with a response greater than that level. In addition, an AV fistula constructed using a radial artery with a hyperemic response that is less than a 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/second</span> increase in PSV was 4.5 times as likely to fail as was one created using a brachial artery with a response &gt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/second</span> increase in PSV.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61222649\"><span class=\"h2\">Arterial imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomy of the artery that will be used to create the AV access is important to the success of the procedure. To avoid the risks and complications associated with arteriography, we suggest using ultrasound as a first-line imaging study, which is adequate given the high degree of concordance between the duplex and arteriography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110399\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef110399 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22</a>].</p><p>A generally recognized standard for arterial diameter does not exist. The most commonly used guideline is taken from the first major publication on this subject [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In this cohort study, a later cohort using a radial artery diameter threshold of 2 mm had an increased rate of AV fistula creation (63 versus 14 percent) with a lower primary failure rate (8 versus 36 percent). Although this threshold has been questioned by other investigators, this 2-mm recommendation for the minimum arterial diameter threshold is the one that is most frequently quoted. Practice guidelines of the Society of Vascular Surgery do not endorse a specific arterial diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. They simply state that studies have shown more than one size to be the minimally acceptable threshold, but that 2.0 mm appears to be the more commonly accepted limit in adults. Some investigators have suggested using a different minimum arterial size threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/18,19,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,23-25</a>]. Unfortunately, these diverse reports are all small and have no randomized controls or are underpowered. The disparities in these studies suggest that while artery size is an important consideration, it is not the only determinant for the development of a successful AV fistula.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1142077478\"><span class=\"h2\">Poor arteries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the increasing age of the dialysis population and the frequency of diabetes and hypertension as comorbidities, arterial occlusive disease is commonly encountered in the patient being evaluated for hemodialysis AV access. The presence of peripheral atherosclerotic occlusive disease affecting the proximal arteries is suggested by abnormal blood pressure testing. (See <a href=\"#H2981495152\" class=\"local\">'Arterial pulses'</a> above.) </p><p>Patients with diabetes commonly display medial calcifications of the peripheral arteries in the forearm that can complicate the technical aspects of creating the surgical anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. In addition, such lesions can hinder the maturation process by preventing the compensatory hypertrophy of the feeding artery and the subsequent increase in the arterial flow. Unrecognized lesions that are hemodynamically significant can also predispose to hand ischemia. Some have suggested obtaining a preoperative plain radiograph of the hand and forearm as part of the evaluation of the diabetic patient to look for vascular calcification as an aid in the planning of the AV access (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F110488\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef110488 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>There are instances in which arteries that are suboptimal for the creation of an AV access are identified in a patient with critical need for the access. There has been only anecdotal experience in prospectively characterizing and treating these cases in an effort to facilitate access creation. In one study, a radial-cephalic AV fistula was created in seven patients in whom radial artery stenosis had been diagnosed by ultrasound evaluation prior to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. At the time of surgery, angioplasty was performed on the radial artery. The AV fistula developed adequately to be cannulated at 15 to 90 days postsurgery in six cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1645544766\"><span class=\"h1\">VENOUS EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Detailed evaluation of the venous anatomy is an important aspect of vascular mapping in preparation for hemodialysis arteriovenous (AV) access placement. Vascular problems affecting access creation are more likely to be venous than arterial. The veins of the extremity are frequently the object of the iatrogenic injury as a result of venipuncture or central venous access. In addition, some studies show that some structural abnormalities can occur in patients with end-stage renal disease independent of any arteriovenous access surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3124558435\"><span class=\"h2\">General characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To ensure the venous outflow of the AV access meets the desired AV access characteristics, the entire extent of the vein and its drainage must be assessed. In addition to evaluating vein diameter and depth, assessment of the capacity to dilate may also be of value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/18,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,31-33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1282769217\"><span class=\"h2\">Vein size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with arterial size, a generally recognized standard for vein size does not exist. The minimum venous diameter threshold most often quoted is 2.5 mm at the point of the anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Some investigators have recommended a different minimally acceptable threshold. </p><p>In one study, 44 consecutive patients were examined with ultrasound prior to the creation of a radial-cephalic fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patient-evaluation-and-vascular-mapping-prior-to-placement-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-access/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Measurements of the forearm cephalic vein were obtained at eight representative sites; the smallest diameter was then analyzed as a preoperative predictor of AV fistula maturation.

The goal of AV access creation is to provide an accessible vascular structure with sufficient blood flow that can be cannulated repeatedly to permit adequate dialysis. Several characteristics must be present for an AV access to be usable for hemodialysis. These include accessibility while the patient is seated; the ability to reliably and repeatedly cannulate the access, which requires a superficial access that is straight for a sufficient length; and adequate blood flow, which relies on unobstructed outflow. (See <a href=\"#H3475778981\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of a patient for hemodialysis AV access is primarily directed toward the creation of an AV fistula. The standard of practice for the creation of an AV fistula is to start distally in the forearm of the nondominant arm and to move proximally. If optimal anatomy is not present in the nondominant arm, then a site on the dominant extremity should be sought. Unfortunately, suitable anatomy may not be present. In these cases, an AV graft should be placed using the same priorities of location.(See <a href=\"#H1142077478\" class=\"local\">'Poor arteries'</a> above and <a href=\"#H156814348\" class=\"local\">'Inadequate veins'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation includes a medical history, a physical examination, and vascular mapping. The medical history is directed toward identifying aspects that might affect the placement of the vascular access and risk factors that are associated with AV access failure (eg, central venous stenosis). (See <a href=\"#H595366564\" class=\"local\">'Patient evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest duplex ultrasound to evaluate the arterial and venous anatomy rather than relying on physical examination alone. The success rates of AV access creation are improved with ultrasound mapping compared with physical examination alone among patients who have not been prescreened. Arteriography or venography may be needed, particularly if proximal arterial (eg, subclavian stenosis) or venous stenosis (eg, central venous stenosis) is suspected. (See <a href=\"#H61222649\" class=\"local\">'Arterial imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1658734573\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The arterial evaluation seeks to identify an artery capable of delivering adequate inflow to the AV access while preserving flow to the digits and hand. Provided the inflow is normal, a normal and patent ulnar artery can usually support perfusion to the hand when the radial artery is used to create the AV access. If there is suspicion of arterial stenosis proximal to the proposed AV access site in the nondominant arm (eg, unequal upper extremity blood pressures), identifying and treating any identified arterial lesions in that arm (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">angioplasty/stenting)</span> is an option. (See <a href=\"#H2404404127\" class=\"local\">'Arterial evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vascular problems affecting AV access creation are more likely to be venous than arterial. To ensure the venous outflow meets the desired characteristics for AV access, the entire extent of the vein and its drainage must be assessed, including vein diameter and depth, and possibly vein distensibility. (See <a href=\"#H1645544766\" class=\"local\">'Venous evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although there are no universally accepted standards for the creation of an AV fistula in adults, we suggest an arterial diameter of &ge;2 mm and a vein diameter of &ge;2.5 mm at the anastomosis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
