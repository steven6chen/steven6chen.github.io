As an example, in a study of 1157 ESRD patients who underwent repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm, the perioperative mortality was 16 percent for those undergoing open repair and 10 percent for those undergoing endoscopic repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-the-dialysis-patient-undergoing-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Thus, elective surgery should not be scheduled to occur on a Monday for a patient who receives maintenance dialysis on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. However, we do not add hemodialysis treatments prior to surgery, since intensive hemodialysis has not been shown to improve outcomes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If dialysis is provided the day of surgery, it is important to institute measures that avoid prolonged anticoagulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-anticoagulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodialysis anticoagulation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The dialysis prescription is generally the same (or as close as possible to) the usual prescription for the individual patient. However, the patient's laboratory values (ie, serum potassium, calcium, and phosphorus) and the dialysate calcium and potassium concentration should be carefully reviewed and adjusted in order to use the dialysate potassium, calcium, and bicarbonate that will allow the patient to go to the operating room with normal or near-normal plasma concentrations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The amount of ultrafiltration should be carefully adjusted to ensure that the patient is at or close to dry weight prior to surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peritoneal dialysis -</strong> For peritoneal dialysis patients, we increase the amount of dialysis approximately a week before surgery. The dialysis time is increased in order to prevent under-dialysis postoperatively in the event that resumption of peritoneal dialysis is delayed (due to an ileus or constipation, for example). Patients who are on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) add an additional exchange each day. Patients who are on automated peritoneal dialysis add one or two hours per day on the cycler.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, there are no published data to support this approach, and some nephrologists do not increase the dialysis time preoperatively for peritoneal dialysis patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As for hemodialysis patients, peritoneal dialysis patients should be at their dry weight prior to surgery. Hypotension secondary to vasodilation and negative inotropy with the use of induction and maintenance agents utilized for anesthesia frequently results in perioperative fluid loading to maintain hemodynamic stability. (See <a href=\"#H649594604\" class=\"local\">'Volume overload'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H649594298\"><span class=\"h1\">MEASURES TO PRESERVE RESIDUAL RENAL FUNCTION PRIOR TO SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preservation of native renal function is extremely important. Many dialysis patients, particularly in the first 6 to 12 months after starting dialysis, rely on residual renal function for fluid balance and solute clearance. Residual renal function has also been associated with increased survival. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urine-output-and-residual-kidney-function-in-kidney-failure#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urine output and residual kidney function in kidney failure&quot;, section on 'Clinical importance of residual kidney function'</a>.)</p><p>We generally discontinue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in dialysis patients prior to surgery. We also generally stop diuretics in dialysis patient, if prescribed preoperatively. Stopping these agents prior to surgery may reduce the hemodynamic instability associated with hypovolemia and vasodilation from anesthetic agents.</p><p>Among patients who are stable, ACE inhibitors and ARBs as well as diuretics may be resumed on the first postoperative day as clinically indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For all dialysis patients who are undergoing surgery, evaluation should include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination and general laboratory evaluation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis access</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment for possible indications for dialysis (hyperkalemia, volume overload)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of anemia status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of nutritional status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation for cardiovascular disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation and possible correction of bleeding diathesis</p><p/><p>In addition, among diabetic patients, there should be a careful review of glucose control and hyperglycemic medical regimen. These issues are individually discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A baseline set of electrolyte values, serum concentrations of glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and albumin, as well as a complete blood count and coagulation profile, should be performed prior to surgery in all patients. This will help to guide the dialysis prescription and provide preoperative baseline values. As an example, phosphorous levels may decrease postoperatively due to decreased oral intake before and after surgery. It is important to monitor phosphorous levels so that medications can be adjusted. Continuing outpatient phosphorous-binding medications can result in dangerously low phosphorous levels.</p><p>Additional laboratory testing should be tailored to the requirements of the individual patient. Patients who are on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> or other medications with a narrow therapeutic index should have drug concentrations checked.</p><p>Blood glucose levels should be reviewed and monitored closely in diabetic patients, prior to, during, and after surgery, particularly when the patient cannot ingest food. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Glycemic control'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H481313195\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As part of the physical examination, the dialysis access (ie, for hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) should be examined to exclude evidence of infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-arteriovenous-graft#H483317\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the arteriovenous graft&quot;, section on 'Infected graft'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula#H30162254\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the mature hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula&quot;, section on 'Infected fistula'</a>.)</p><p>The fistula or graft should be assessed by clinical examination for patency. The site of the access should be marked and staff warned as to its location. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula#H16358064\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the mature hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula&quot;, section on 'Thrombosed fistula'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-arteriovenous-graft#H182035029\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the arteriovenous graft&quot;, section on 'Thrombosed graft'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H649594329\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for dialysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major indications for urgent preoperative dialysis are hyperkalemia and volume overload.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H649594496\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperkalemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potassium concentration that is acceptable for surgery depends on the urgency of the surgery. There are no guidelines that definitively state a maximum safe level of potassium prior to induction of anesthesia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H649594502\"><span class=\"h4\">Elective surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For elective surgery, most anesthesiologists are prepared to induce a patient with a serum potassium level &lt;5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. The potassium concentration that is deemed acceptable for induction of individual patients may vary depending on chronicity of hyperkalemia, location of surgery (freestanding surgery center versus hospital operating room), and type of surgery. The type of surgery varies with respect to blood loss, fluid shifts, and acid-base disturbances, all which affect the rate of rise of the serum potassium concentration.</p><p>We generally dialyze patients who are undergoing elective surgery and have a serum potassium &gt;5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. Hemodialysis can remove 25 to 50 mEq of potassium per hour, with variability based upon the initial serum potassium concentration, the dialyzer, the blood flood rate, and the potassium concentration of the bath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-the-dialysis-patient-undergoing-surgery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In general, two hours of hemodialysis will suffice to prepare a patient for surgery under most circumstances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H649594522\"><span class=\"h4\">Nonelective surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, the approach to hyperkalemic patients who require nonelective surgery is based upon the clinical setting. Important considerations include the anticipated degree of tissue damage and release of potassium during the operation, the urgency for surgery, and determination of whether it is safe to delay surgery for three to four hours while the patient is dialyzed.</p><p>All patients with an elevated serum potassium concentration should have a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Surgery with anesthesia in the face of chronic hyperkalemia (K &lt;6) and no ECG changes is usually well tolerated by the majority of patients. Chronic dialysis patients often have an increased tolerance for hyperkalemia as ECG changes are frequently not seen until the serum potassium concentration exceeds 6.0 to 6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-the-dialysis-patient-undergoing-surgery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Changes in the ECG with hyperkalemia are thought to result from alterations in the transcellular potassium gradient rather than the absolute value of the serum potassium. Dialysis patients often have elevations in total body and intracellular potassium; as a result, the transcellular gradient may not be altered with moderate hyperkalemia, resulting in the absence of hyperkalemic changes on the ECG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-the-dialysis-patient-undergoing-surgery/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there are no ECG changes and the patient is otherwise stable, an individual with a serum potassium of 6.0 to 6.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> should be able to safely undergo emergency surgery with close intraoperative monitoring by anesthesiologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-the-dialysis-patient-undergoing-surgery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In such cases, hyperkalemia may be treated with medical (ie nondialytic therapies) if there is no functioning dialysis access. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Insulin with glucose'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the surgery is elective, some clinicians will place a temporary catheter to provide dialysis prior to surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If ECG features of hyperkalemia are present, we dialyze the patient. As noted above, two hours of hemodialysis is sufficient to reduce potassium. If dialysis <strong>cannot</strong> be performed prior to surgery, medical management should be initiated (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>). However, even a short hemodialysis session would be preferred, if at all possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a true emergency, life-threatening surgical situation, the operation is performed regardless of potassium level. Anesthesiologists will temporize with medical management of the hyperkalemia until a more definitive solution for electrolyte control can be initiated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H649594604\"><span class=\"h3\">Volume overload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal volume status prior to surgery is based in part upon estimates of anticipated fluid to be administered <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lost during surgery. As a result, a discussion with the surgeon and anesthesiologist regarding perioperative volume status goals is desirable:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If euvolemia or estimated dry weight is not achieved <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the patient receives a large volume of fluid during surgery, hypervolemia and possibly pulmonary edema can occur in the immediate postoperative period, thereby necessitating dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If too much fluid is removed, there is the risk of hypotension during anesthesia-induced systemic vasodilatation; this can cause many significant complications, including but not limited to thrombosis of the arteriovenous access.</p><p/><p>Standard practice in anesthesia is to utilize 500 mL infusion bags of normal saline with a micro-dripper to minimize electrolyte and volume loading with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients (depending on the surgical intervention).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Anemia status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally, the preoperative hemoglobin concentration should be at the recommended target for ESRD patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients#H2992892097\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of anemia in hemodialysis patients&quot;, section on 'Target levels'</a>.)</p><p>For patients undergoing elective surgery, if the patient has a hemoglobin less than target, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) may be administered preoperatively to bring the baseline hemoglobin closer to goal. Iron studies should also be performed since iron deficiency can contribute to anemia and ESA resistance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-hemodialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency in hemodialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Protein-energy wasting, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease may increase mortality in the dialysis population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-the-dialysis-patient-undergoing-surgery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It is important to identify patients at high risk and work to reduce these risk factors prior to undergoing surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-the-dialysis-patient-undergoing-surgery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The assessment of the nutritional status of ESRD patients is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-nutritional-status-in-hemodialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of nutritional status in hemodialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since hypertension is common in the dialysis population, significantly elevated blood pressure levels measured prior to surgery may require immediate therapy. With dialysis patients, initial therapy of hypertension should aim to optimize volume status via the fluid removal with dialysis since volume overload is likely to be causative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertension-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertension in dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Antihypertensive therapy may be necessary if the blood pressure remains high despite the attainment of optimal dry weight or if dialysis cannot be performed in the immediate preoperative period because the surgery is emergent or access related. In this setting, parenteral antihypertensive therapy is commonly used. Agents most commonly used include intravenous (IV) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalaprilat-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalaprilat</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a> (which should be given with beta blockers to minimize the effect of reflex sympathetic activation), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nitroglycerine. If the patient is monitored in the intensive care unit, IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a> (or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicardipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nicardipine</a>, and some institutions have access to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clevidipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clevidipine</a> for malignant hypertension) may also be utilized. The benefits of using beta blockers in this setting are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Transdermal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> requires a longer time to achieve adequate blood levels and may not immediately control blood pressure. Transdermal clonidine may be more useful postoperatively or when blood pressure control is less urgent.<strong> </strong>Anesthesiologists avoid long-acting antihypertensives in the perioperative period as they render the patients more hemodynamically unstable, with increased risk of intraoperative hypotension and postoperative fluid shifts.</p><p>We do not initiate beta blockers or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> preoperatively, but we do continue these agents in patients who are already on them in order to avoid withdrawal syndromes.</p><p>Once oral intake is tolerated, the normal antihypertensive regimen may be reinstituted (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertension-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertension in dialysis patients&quot;</a>). In some settings, these medications may have to be gradually introduced <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> staggered; precise blood pressure limits for withholding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> giving medications or doses may be needed as the patient's requirements for antihypertensive therapy may differ in the acute postoperative setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coronary artery disease and myocardial dysfunction are the most common comorbidities in patients with renal failure. In some series, approximately 50 percent of dialysis patients undergoing surgery are thought to have cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-the-dialysis-patient-undergoing-surgery/abstract/7,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14</a>].</p><p>Heart disease results in significant morbidity and mortality in patients with ESRD, even among those not undergoing surgery. As an example, in one prospective study of 305 dialysis patients followed for a four-year period, 114 cardiovascular events and 89 deaths were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-the-dialysis-patient-undergoing-surgery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The mortality was 10 times that of the general population, including 44 times higher in diabetic patients with renal disease.

The risk stratification and screening for cardiovascular disease and myocardial dysfunction in ESRD patients are discussed elsewhere.

This is consistent with the preoperative approach to the non-chronic kidney disease (CKD) general population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-cardiac-risk-for-noncardiac-surgery#H85539203\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of cardiac risk for noncardiac surgery&quot;, section on 'Patients without indications for long-term therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Among patients who are already on beta blockers, we continue them in order to prevent withdrawal. In addition, for all patients, we use beta blockers for rate control in the setting of demand ischemia. The requirement for rate control in the setting of demand ischemia is uncommonly observed intraoperatively but may be observed postoperatively in the setting of high catecholamine levels, exacerbated by pain and fluid shifts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding diathesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An increased tendency to bleeding may be present in dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-the-dialysis-patient-undergoing-surgery/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. This is frequently manifested by bleeding at sites of surgery or trauma. However, not all uremic patients have a bleeding diathesis, and some are actually hypercoagulable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-the-dialysis-patient-undergoing-surgery/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].

Although some studies have found a good correlation between uremic bleeding and the bleeding time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-the-dialysis-patient-undergoing-surgery/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], a normal bleeding time does not predict the safety of surgical procedures, nor does a prolonged bleeding time predict excessive bleeding.

Heparin doses can be reduced and often eliminated with use of saline flushes during the hemodialysis treatment. If heparin is administered, the coagulation profile should return to normal within <strong>four hours</strong> of heparin termination. Thus, if time permits, we wait for the coagulation parameters to normalize prior to beginning surgery.</p><p>After major surgery, heparin with dialysis should be avoided for 24 to 48 hours, particularly if the site of surgery is not easy to assess for evidence of postoperative bleeding or if bleeding would result in catastrophic consequences. Discussion with the surgeon concerning these issues is vital. Alternatives to the administration of heparin are readily available, including no-heparin hemodialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-anticoagulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodialysis anticoagulation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Glycemic control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many dialysis patients have diabetes. Patients usually have better control of blood glucose levels at home than in the hospital because of multiple factors. These include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Change in physical activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute comorbid conditions for which they have been hospitalized, such as infections, vomiting, and diarrhea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to ingest food.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in oral intake and medical regimen based on the surgical schedule, which often changes. As an example, surgery is scheduled at 8 AM but finally takes place at 4 PM.</p><p/><p>Many issues regarding the perioperative care of dialysis patients with diabetes are the same as for diabetic patients without ESRD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of blood glucose in adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, there are important considerations that are specific to diabetic patients who are on dialysis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dialysis patients with type 1 diabetes may be more brittle than patients with type 1 diabetes who do not have ESRD. In some patients, for example, a single unit of insulin can make a difference between a blood glucose level of 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and one of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. Given the wide variations in glucose metabolism with surgery, the management of these patients may therefore be extremely difficult.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among dialysis patients with type 2 diabetes, the potential for hyperglycemia with surgery is often underestimated. This is because glycemic control medications have often been discontinued in such patients when they start dialysis. Oral hypoglycemic agents are discontinued in such patients because insulin requirements decrease with ESRD.</p><p/><p>Among type 2 diabetic patients who are treated with oral hypoglycemic agents, profound hypoglycemia may result in patients who cannot eat because of the increased half-life of some oral hypoglycemics with renal failure. In this setting, the administration of IV dextrose for 48 hours may be necessary to maintain blood glucose.</p><p>General recommendations regarding the care of diabetic patients undergoing surgery are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of blood glucose in adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Issues specific to all diabetic dialysis patients are as follow:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IV fluids should contain dextrose if the patient is fasting; insulin coverage is adjusted accordingly. The use of dextrose-containing solutions will also help to prevent hyperkalemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insulin requirements of peritoneal dialysis patients may change depending on whether or not they are performing exchanges. Unless contraindicated, peritoneal dialysis patients should continue exchanges while awaiting surgery; however, their peritoneum should be drained prior to surgery, computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen, or any endoscopic procedures. In these settings, insulin requirements often change since glucose is absorbed from peritoneal fluid during exchanges (and this source of glucose goes away when exchanges are stopped).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have had years of experience in determining the particular dose of insulin required for their glucose control in different settings should be consulted to help determine the dose of insulin in the hospital.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients in whom diabetic ketoacidosis is suspected, urine ketones are not useful; serum ketones must be measured.</p><p/><p>Glucose intolerance is also a feature of uremia. As a result, nondiabetic dialysis patients may exhibit hyperglycemia in the perioperative period, especially when given glucose-containing solutions such as parenteral hyperalimentation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients require intravenous access. Among ESRD patients, we use small caliber IV catheters that are placed in the hands or feet. If peripheral access is not available, we place an internal jugular central venous catheter. Placement of catheters in the subclavian vein should be avoided, if at all possible, because of the risk of central stenosis, which could imperil the fistula or graft. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-vein-stenosis-associated-with-hemodialysis-access#H204765325\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central vein stenosis associated with hemodialysis access&quot;, section on 'Central venous catheters'</a>.)</p><p>Central lines should also not be placed on the same side as the arteriovenous access.</p><p>Knowledge of the patients' vascular anatomy, such as an occluded internal jugular, subclavian, or femoral vein, may help the anesthesiologist establish central venous access. The use of small, portable ultrasound machines to identify patent veins has decreased complications, including accidental arterial punctures and pneumothorax in high-risk patients with multiple stenotic veins.</p><p>Displaying a sign at the patient's bedside to save the designated arm for proposed or existing accesses (avoiding needle sticks or blood pressure measurements in the arm) is important. Patients need to be taught to remind health care professionals not to use the designated arm. Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines should be avoided in dialysis patients, unless patients have a short life expectancy, so as to preserve the superficial veins for future arteriovenous fistulas. Tunneled PICC lines placed in the internal jugular vein are preferred to peripherally inserted lines.

The optimal choice of the anesthetic agent varies based upon underlying metabolism, concurrent comorbid conditions, and the surgical procedure.

Capillary leak and fluid often start to occur at 48 to 72 hours postoperatively, causing pulmonary edema and demand ischemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1103464995\"><span class=\"h2\">Anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite being at target hemoglobin, patients often require transfusions postoperatively due to substantial intra- or postoperative blood loss.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Surgical morbidity and mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be well dialyzed prior to surgery. Hemodialysis patients should be dialyzed the day before surgery, if possible. If dialysis is provided the day of surgery, it is important to institute measures that avoid prolonged anticoagulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We increase the dialysis of peritoneal dialysis patients approximately a week before surgery. (See <a href=\"#H649594083\" class=\"local\">'Routine dialysis prior to surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We discontinue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and diuretics in most dialysis patients two days prior to surgery. Stopping these agents prior to surgery may reduce the hemodynamic instability associated with hypovolemia and vasodilation from anesthetic agents. (See <a href=\"#H649594298\" class=\"local\">'Measures to preserve residual renal function prior to surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A baseline set of electrolyte values, serum concentrations of glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and albumin, as well as a complete blood count and coagulation profile, should be performed prior to surgery in all patients. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preoperative physical exam should include careful evaluation of the dialysis access (ie, for hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis).

The potassium concentration that is acceptable for surgery depends on the urgency of the surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We generally dialyze patients who have a serum potassium &gt;5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> prior to elective surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If there are no electrocardiographic (ECG) changes and the patient is otherwise stable, an individual with a serum potassium of 6.0 to 6.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> should be able to safely undergo emergency surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If ECG features of hyperkalemia are present, we dialyze the patient prior to surgery.

The optimal volume status prior to surgery depends on estimations of the amount of fluid to be administered <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lost during surgery. A discussion with the surgeon and anesthesiologist regarding perioperative volume status goals is desirable. (See <a href=\"#H649594604\" class=\"local\">'Volume overload'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preoperative hemoglobin concentration should be at the recommended target for ESRD patients. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Anemia status'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Significant hypertension prior to surgery should be treated with fluid removal with dialysis. If the blood pressure remains high despite dialysis, or if dialysis cannot be performed in the immediate preoperative period, hypertension may be treated with parenteral medications. Long-acting antihypertensives should be avoided in the perioperative period as they render the patients more hemodynamically unstable. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preoperative cardiac evaluation depends upon the level of risk. We stratify patients for cardiac risk according to clinical criteria and according to the nature and risk of the surgical procedure. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increased tendency to bleeding may be, but is not always, present in dialysis patients. We do not perform bleeding time prior to surgery, because it is not predictive of safety during the surgical procedure, and the test is subject to technical variability.
