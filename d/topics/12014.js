Patients with OSA are often obese and have an increased prevalence of numerous other cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although OSA is two to four times more common in men, relationships of biomarkers of myocardial injury and incident heart failure in relation to OSA appear to be stronger in women than in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated a consistent association between OSA and hypertension, coronary heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, and heart failure. Although most studies have demonstrated these associations independent of the confounding influence of obesity, whether OSA lies directly along the causal pathway or is linked through common comorbidities such as obesity is not always clear in any given patient, and all of these diseases carry multifactorial etiologic risk. However, accumulating evidence also suggests that successful treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can improve cardiovascular outcomes.</p><p>The association between OSA and cardiovascular disease and the potential impact of OSA-specific therapy on cardiovascular outcomes are discussed here. The evaluation and management of sleep-related breathing disorders in patients with heart failure and stroke are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-disordered-breathing-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-disordered breathing in heart failure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-related-breathing-disorders-and-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-related breathing disorders and stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87370031\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with OSA experience repetitive episodes of apnea or reduced inspiratory airflow due to upper airway obstruction during sleep. These events are associated with intermittent hypoxemia and possibly hypercapnia and usually provoke an arousal from sleep. The arousal is associated with restoration of upper airway patency and ventilation.</p><p>The resulting hemodynamic, autonomic, inflammatory, and metabolic effects of this abnormal breathing and arousal pattern may contribute to the pathogenesis of a range of cardiovascular diseases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F93834\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93834 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>OSA is associated with a significant increase in sympathetic activity during sleep, which in turn influences heart rate and blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Increased sympathetic activity appears to be induced through a variety of different mechanisms, including chemoreflex stimulation by hypoxia and hypercapnia, baroreflexes, pulmonary afferents, impairment in venous return to the heart, alterations in cardiac output, and possibly the arousal response. Endothelial dysfunction may also play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3409642565\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84743934\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical evidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experimental and population-based data identify OSA as a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease and support its association with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. Observational data in men with severe OSA support the benefit of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on reduction of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Therefore, several clinical trials have been designed to examine the effect of CPAP therapy on cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3237340402\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While most studies report improvement in sleep-related respiratory events, daytime sleepiness, blood pressure control, and intermediate cardiovascular endpoints, none has unequivocally shown benefits in the reduction of cardiovascular events (eg, cardiovascular mortality, acute myocardial infarction, stroke) as a whole. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Sleep Apnea Cardiovascular Endpoints (SAVE) study is one of the largest multicenter randomized clinical trials to examine the impact of CPAP on cardiovascular outcomes. In SAVE, 2717 patients with moderate to severe OSA and established cardiovascular disease were randomized to CPAP therapy plus usual care or usual care alone (eg, education, risk factor modification) and followed for 3.7 years (ie, secondary prevention) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Despite a reduction in the apnea-hypopnea index from 29 to 3.7 events per hour per night (ie, indicating overall adequate control of OSA), CPAP was not associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular events (cardiovascular deaths, myocardial infarction, stroke or hospitalizations for heart failure, unstable angina or transient ischemic attack; 17 percent [CPAP] versus 15.4 percent [usual care]). Although the rate of cardiovascular events was slightly improved in those adherent to CPAP (ie, &ge;4 hours per night), the benefit was not statistically significant. However, several aspects limited interpretability and generalizability including the exclusion of patients with &quot;sleepy&quot; OSA, patients at high risk of an accident and patients with severe hypoxemia, as well as use of automated oximetry data rather than polysomnography for diagnosis and an overall low adherence rate to CPAP (mean was 3.3 hours per night), which may have lessened the impact of the therapy on the outcome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a similar population of nonsleepy OSA patients, smaller randomized trials reported a similar lack of benefit from CPAP during several years of follow-up in 725 patients with OSA who did not have established cardiovascular disease (ie, primary prevention), 224 patients who had just undergone coronary revascularization, and 140 patients with recent stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of 10 randomized trials of patients with OSA, compared with no treatment or sham, CPAP did not result in a reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events (acute coronary events, stroke, or vascular death) or all-cause death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The lack of benefit was reported despite OSA severity as well as duration of therapy. &#160;</p><p/><p>Further randomized trials are required to fully elucidate whether or not clinically meaningful cardiovascular benefit can be derived from CPAP in patients with OSA. It also remains unclear whether the &quot;sleepy&quot; OSA patient may derive cardiovascular benefit from OSA treatment and whether considering larger sample sizes with longer duration follow-up may enhance the ability to detect significant cardiovascular benefit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPERTENSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypertension and OSA frequently coexist. OSA-related autonomic dysfunction is evidenced by elevated levels of plasma and urinary catecholamines and also peroneal microneurography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. It has been well established that OSA is associated with lack of the normal pattern of reduction of blood pressure during sleep (ie, a nondipping blood pressure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], even in those with established cardiovascular disease or risk on antihypertensive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1241319\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical evidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cross-sectional population-based studies consistently find an increased prevalence of hypertension in patients with OSA, compared with controls, which remains significant after controlling for potential confounding factors such as age and obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/5,19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,19-23</a>]. The association between hypertension and OSA has been noted across a variety of patient groups, including the general adult population, older adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], those with spinal cord injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and stroke survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Prospective longitudinal studies have also demonstrated an increased risk of incident hypertension in patients with OSA who are normotensive at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/5,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,27</a>], although this finding has not been entirely consistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Most studies support a monotonic, dose-response effect between the severity of OSA and the likelihood of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/5,19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,19-24</a>]. As an example, a prospective epidemiologic cohort study of 709 subjects estimated that patients with mild OSA (apnea hypopnea index [AHI] of 5 to 15 events per hour of sleep) had twice the risk of newly identified incident systemic hypertension, compared with those with an AHI of 0 (adjusted odds ratio 2.03, 95% CI 1.29-3.17), while subjects with an AHI of &ge;15 events per hour of sleep had nearly three times the risk (adjusted odds ratio 2.89, 95% CI 1.46-5.64) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65555\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65555 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Another large study found that OSA was only modestly associated with incident systolic hypertension after adjusting for relevant confounders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, those with a body mass index of &lt;27 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> and a severe burden of apnea had an almost threefold higher odds of incident hypertension.</p><p>Some studies have also found that OSA is not as strongly related to isolated systolic hypertension as it is to isolated diastolic or combined <span class=\"nowrap\">systolic/diastolic</span> hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Others have found that the severity of OSA during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is more strongly associated with both prevalent and incident hypertension than OSA severity during non-REM sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Observational data examining the natural history of the effect of continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP) on incident hypertension suggest a benefit of OSA treatment. As an example, a prospective epidemiologic cohort study that followed 1889 individuals for a median of 12 years identified an increased risk of incident hypertension among those with OSA untreated with CPAP due to refusal (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.0), nonadherence (HR 1.8), or ineligibility (HR 1.3), compared with controls; patients with OSA treated with CPAP had a lower risk of incident hypertension, compared with controls (HR 0.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The association between OSA and hypertension appears to be particularly prominent in patients with resistant hypertension. In one study, OSA was found in 71 percent of patients with resistant hypertension, compared with 38 percent of patients with controlled systemic hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In another study, severe compared with moderate OSA in those with increased cardiovascular risk was associated with increased blood pressure despite use of an intensive antihypertensive regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-risk-factors-and-evaluation-of-resistant-hypertension#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, risk factors, and evaluation of resistant hypertension&quot;, section on 'Obstructive sleep apnea'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Randomized trials and meta-analyses have found that effective treatment of OSA using positive airway pressure reduces systemic blood pressure, regardless of whether the patients are hypertensive at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/34-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-45</a>].</p><p>Four key observations can be made on the basis of these trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First, the reduction in systemic blood pressure due to positive airway pressure therapy is usually small, albeit clinically relevant. In a 2014 meta-analysis that included 30 randomized trials and over 1900 patients, CPAP therapy was associated with a mean net lowering in systolic blood pressure of 2.6 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The clinical relevance of this level of reduction is highlighted by data demonstrating that a 1 to 2 mmHg reduction in blood pressure is associated with a reduction in major cardiovascular events, stroke, and heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a large, randomized trial of 194 patients with resistant hypertension, those randomized to CPAP had a greater reduction in 24-hour mean blood pressure (3.1 mmHg) and 24-hour diastolic blood pressure (3.2 mmHg), but not 24-hour systolic blood pressure (3.1 mmHg, 95% CI -0.6-6.7), compared with those who did not receive CPAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. A meta-analysis using patient-level data from eight randomized trials also found that the presence of uncontrolled hypertension at baseline was an important predictor of reduction in blood pressure with CPAP therapy, independent of OSA severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second, the reduction in systemic blood pressure due to positive airway pressure therapy appears to be less than that due to antihypertensive medication. In a randomized crossover trial of 23 patients with both untreated hypertension and untreated OSA, antihypertensive medication (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=valsartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valsartan</a> 160 mg per day) lowered mean 24-hour blood pressure significantly more than CPAP therapy (-9 versus -2.1 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Moreover, for patients whose blood pressure was not controlled with CPAP or valsartan, an extended trial of treatment that combined the two therapies showed further significant reduction in blood pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third, although the finding that positive airway pressure therapy reduces systemic blood pressure has been fairly consistent, findings have not been universal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/51-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-55</a>]. The conflicting results may be related to methodological differences among the trials, including different study populations, co-interventions, CPAP adherence rates, sample sizes, outcome measures (single time point or 24-hour blood pressure), and durations of follow-up. Some of the more common or important methodological differences include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Use of antihypertensive medications &ndash; Studies have differed in terms of whether antihypertensive medications were allowed during the study and, if so, how they were initiated, maintained, or discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Studies have also differed in terms of how antihypertensive therapy was accounted for in the analysis, which may contribute to the conflicting results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Excessive daytime sleepiness &ndash; Most studies are comprised primarily of OSA patients with excessive daytime sleepiness. In those that have evaluated patients without excessive daytime sleepiness, most have found no reduction in the blood pressure or incidence of hypertension following the initiation of CPAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/11,52,54,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,52,54,57</a>]. One trial found only a small reduction in the diastolic blood pressure and may have been confounded by the inclusion of patients with OSA-related sleepiness that was not severe enough to be defined as excessive daytime sleepiness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Taken together, these trials suggest that blood pressure reduction achieved by CPAP therapy is less in nonsleepy patients than in sleepy patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>OSA severity &ndash; The decrease in blood pressure in response to treatment with CPAP has been shown to be related to the severity of sleep apnea (as measured by the degree of nocturnal hypoxemia), with a greater decrease in blood pressure among those with more severe OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The severity of hypoxemia varies among studies and may influence the results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Follow-up duration &ndash; Most trials have performed follow-up assessments at two to three months. However, a randomized trial of 83 males with moderate to severe OSA, coronary heart disease, and verified hypertension showed a reduction in systolic blood pressure, but not diastolic blood pressure, compared with controls over a median follow-up period of 36 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. These results support a long-lasting benefit of systolic blood pressure reduction in patients with moderate to severe OSA treated with CPAP therapy. However, CPAP withdrawal may be associated with a rebound increase in blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fourth, alternative or CPAP-adjunctive approaches to improve blood pressure have also been studied. A multicenter randomized trial in 318 patients with moderate to severe OSA and increased cardiovascular risk demonstrated that CPAP was more effective than supplemental oxygen in reducing 24-hour mean arterial blood pressure (-2.8 mmHg, 95% CI -5.1 to -0.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. These results suggest that pathways independent of hypoxia play a role in augmentation of blood pressure in OSA. In a per protocol analysis that included those with a prespecified CPAP adherence threshold, another randomized trial demonstrated a more pronounced reduction of mean arterial and systolic pressures with CPAP plus a weight loss intervention, compared with either approach alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p/><p>Among the therapies, the impact of positive airway pressure, the most common therapy used for sleep apnea, is the most widely studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/34-39,41,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-39,41,45</a>].</p><p>In contrast, the effects of alternative therapies (eg, oral appliances or upper airway surgery) on blood pressure are less well studied but suggest similar benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/45,62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,62,63</a>]. One meta-analysis of 51 studies of patients with hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea reported that compared with patients on placebo or not receiving therapy, mandibular advancement devices were associated with a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP; -2.1 mmHg, 95% CI -0.8 to -3.4) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP; -1.9 mmHg; 95% CI -0.5 to -3.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In addition, the level SBP and DBP reduction was similar to that reported in patients treated with CPAP.</p><p>Taken together, the evidence indicates that treatment of OSA with positive airway pressure reduces systemic blood pressure in many patients. However, the reduction is usually modest and may not occur in patients with longstanding systemic hypertension or without excessive sleepiness. Despite this small reduction, it should be noted that a decrease of only 2 mmHg in blood pressure is enough to significantly reduce cardiovascular risk. Such modest reductions may be attributable to limited ability to reverse vascular pathology in those with chronic exposure to OSA and underscore the notion that early and prolonged OSA treatment may be required as a more effective therapeutic preventative approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1243533\"><span class=\"h1\">CORONARY HEART DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is increasing evidence that severe (but probably not mild) OSA is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events related to coronary heart disease, independent of obesity and other shared risk factors, and that comorbid OSA is a risk factor for worse outcomes in patients with established coronary heart disease. This effect may be mediated by the association between OSA and multiple vascular risk factors, including hypertension, decreased high density lipoproteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], increased C-reactive protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>], increased homocysteine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>], elevated blood glucose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>], and insulin <span class=\"nowrap\">resistance/diabetes</span> mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>Concentrations of high-sensitivity troponin-I have been associated with increasing severity of OSA (defined by the apnea hypopnea index [AHI]) as well as nocturnal hypoxia (percentage sleep time &lt;90 percent oxygen saturation), suggesting that increasing OSA burden may result in low-grade myocardial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].

Patients with untreated, severe OSA (mean AHI of 43 events per hour of sleep) had a higher incidence of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events than untreated patients with mild-moderate OSA, simple snorers, and healthy participants, even after adjustment for confounding variables.

In a prospective cohort study, polysomnography was performed on 89 consecutive patients who had undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention for acute coronary syndrome (53 with acute myocardial infarction and 36 with unstable angina) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. OSA (defined as AHI &ge;10 events per hour of sleep) was detected in 51 patients (57 percent). During a mean follow up of 227 days, the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, reinfarction, target vessel revascularization) was higher among patients with OSA than those without OSA (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 11.6, 95% CI 2.2-62.2).</p><p>While the evidence above supports the association between untreated, severe OSA and the development of adverse cardiovascular events (eg, myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome), the reverse may also be true; that is, myocardial infarction may be associated with worsening of sleep-disordered breathing. This was demonstrated by a prospective cohort study of 2721 individuals (mean age 62 years) without known cardiovascular disease who were followed for a mean of five years, which included polysomnography performed at baseline and at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Fifty-seven subjects (2 percent) had a myocardial infarction during the study. The adjusted AHI increased a mean of 6.37 respiratory events per hour of sleep among those who had a myocardial infarction, compared with only 2.71 respiratory events per hour of sleep among those who had not had a myocardial infarction. It was not determined whether the increased respiratory event rate among individuals who had a myocardial infarction only was due to an increase in obstructive events, central events, or both, although, among patients who developed either a myocardial infarction or heart failure, the rates of both obstructive and central respiratory events increased.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observational data suggest that treatment of OSA with positive airway pressure may reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events, including events related to coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/10,74,76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,74,76,77</a>].

Patients with OSA who were treated with CPAP (mean AHI of 42 events per hour of sleep prior to therapy) had a lower incidence of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events than patients with untreated, severe OSA (mean AHI of 43 events per hour of sleep). In fact, the incidence of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events among patients treated with CPAP did not differ significantly from that in individuals without OSA. Cardiovascular events included myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, and stroke.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective cohort study followed 449 patients with mild or moderate OSA for a median of six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Treatment of OSA (primarily CPAP) was associated with a reduction of the likelihood of a cardiovascular event (adjusted HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.21-0.62), compared with no treatment. Cardiovascular events were defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, or acute coronary syndrome requiring a revascularization procedure. An important limitation of this study was that combining patients with mild and moderate OSA made it impossible to determine whether treatment benefited only patients with moderate OSA, mild OSA, or both.</p><p/><p>A limitation of these studies is the nonrandomized design and the possibility that those who were not adherent with CPAP represent a group at increased cardiovascular risk due to engaging in unhealthy lifestyle behaviors or nonadherence with other aspects of their medical care.</p><p>The potential benefit of OSA therapy on reducing cardiovascular events has not yet been confirmed in randomized trials. For the most part, randomized trials of positive airway pressure therapy in patients with OSA have been short-term studies that have not measured endpoints related to coronary heart disease. One exception was a multicenter randomized trial in which 725 patients without a history of cardiovascular events who had moderate to severe OSA (AHI &ge;20 events per hour) and no daytime sleepiness (Epworth sleepiness scale [ESS] score &le;10) were randomly assigned to receive CPAP therapy or no active intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. After a median follow-up of four years, there was no significant difference in the rate of systemic hypertension or cardiovascular events (including nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, transient ischemic attack, hospitalization for unstable angina or arrhythmia, or cardiovascular death) in patients treated with CPAP, compared with controls (incidence density ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.63-1.1).

In a study that included 400 patients with moderate to severe OSA, the prevalence of AF on 24-hour Holter monitoring was 3 percent, which was approximately threefold higher than the expected prevalence in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. In another large, cross-sectional study, there was an increased prevalence of AF in patients with and without sleep-disordered breathing by polysomnogram (5 versus 1 percent), which was independent of age, sex, body mass index, and prevalent cardiovascular disease including heart failure (odds ratio 4.0, 95% CI 1.0-15.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>Dose-response relationships have been observed in a cohort of nearly 3000 older men, with increasing severity of sleep-disordered breathing associated with increasing prevalence of AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Such findings were more pronounced with central versus obstructive sleep apnea. Although not definitive, support for an immediate causal temporal relationship of respiratory events (mainly hypopneas) preceding paroxysms of AF has been demonstrated using a case crossover design [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. These findings suggest that discrete episodes of upper airway compromise may lead to proximate arrhythmia generation.</p><p>Conversely, the prevalence of OSA in patients with AF is much higher, with estimates ranging from 30 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/80,86-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,86-88</a>]. Most, but not all, studies have found that the association is independent of shared risks factors such as increased age, obesity, hypertension, and heart failure.

In a large clinic-based cohort, nocturnal hypoxia predicted a threefold increased risk of incident AF in those less than 65 years of age, even after adjustment for confounding by obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Another retrospective cohort study of nearly 7000 middle-aged adults demonstrated that those with an AHI &gt;5 had a 55 percent increased risk of incident AF over a median follow-up period of 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Prospective data involving older men support an approximate twofold increase in odds of AF associated with baseline central sleep apnea or Cheyne-Stokes respirations over a 6.5-year mean follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>Accumulating data implicate OSA as a risk factor for recurrent AF after cardioversion or ablation. In a meta-analysis of six observational studies, a diagnosis of OSA increased the risk of recurrent AF after radiofrequency catheter ablation by 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87368701\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited data suggest that treatment of OSA reduces the risk of recurrent AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/91-96\" class=\"abstract_t\">91-96</a>]. As an example, in an observational study of 130 patients who had been electrically cardioverted from AF, the rate of recurrent AF in patients with untreated OSA, with treated OSA, and without OSA was 82, 42, and 53 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. In another observational study that included 62 patients with OSA undergoing pulmonary vein isolation, use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy was associated with a lower rate of recurrent AF (28 versus 63 percent for CPAP users versus nonusers; p = 0.01) and a higher arrhythmia-free survival rate off antiarrhythmic drugs (66 versus 33 percent; p = 0.02) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].

The bradycardia-tachycardia phenomenon may be observed with respiratory events (apneas and hypopneas). During the apnea, there is absence of ventilation and hypoxic stimulation of the carotid body is vagotonic, resulting in bradycardia. Subsequent to the respiratory event, sympathetic activation occurs due to synergistic influences of hypoxia, hypercapnia, and increasing thoracoabdominal efforts resulting in tachycardia. Although it is unknown whether or not the relationship is causal, there may be a temporal relationship, with arrhythmias occurring more frequently after a respiratory event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Arrhythmogenesis is also enhanced in OSA due to intermittent hypoxia, which may result in delayed depolarization, respiratory acidosis resulting in triggered automaticity, and re-entrant mechanisms likely due to autonomic nervous system fluctuations.</p><p>Although conduction delay arrhythmias including atrioventricular block and sinus pauses have been highlighted in older reports and anecdotally observed in OSA, multicenter epidemiologic data do not demonstrate a significant association of OSA and these arrhythmias compared with those with lesser degree or without OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. As these bradyarrhythmias are likely more pronounced in severe OSA, older reports may reflect historical case finding selection bias during a time when primarily severe cases of OSA were detected and diagnosed. For example, bradyarrhythmias, including atrioventricular (AV) block, sinus pause, and asystole, occur in up to 18 percent of patients with severe OSA (ie, apnea hypopnea index [AHI] &gt;30 events per hour) and lower oxygen saturation nadirs during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. Bradyarrhythmias anecdotally appear to be more common during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep due to enhanced parasympathetic tone. In extreme cases, asystole can last longer than 10 seconds. The contribution of asystole to the increase in mortality associated with OSA is unclear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permanent-cardiac-pacing-overview-of-devices-and-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Permanent cardiac pacing: Overview of devices and indications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bradycardia and asystole in patients with OSA may result from enhanced vagal tone, structural disease of the conduction system, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. In one study, 15 patients with OSA and asystole who underwent electrophysiology exams all had normal (or only slightly abnormal) sinus and AV node function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Activation of the parasympathetic nervous system may result from hypoventilation, hypoxemia, respiratory acidosis, or repeated intrathoracic pressure changes due to airway obstruction during sleep.</p><p>Ventricular ectopy and tachyarrhythmias have also been associated with OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. In an observational study, 228 patients with a sleep-related breathing disorder (respiratory disturbance index [RDI] &ge;30 events per hour of sleep) were compared with 338 control subjects (RDI &lt;5 events per hour of sleep) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. The sleep-related breathing disorder group had a higher prevalence of nocturnal atrial fibrillation (AF; 4.8 versus 0.9 percent), nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (5.3 versus 1.2 percent), and complex ventricular ectopy (25 versus 14.5 percent). These relationships persisted after adjustment for confounding variables. Examples of complex ventricular ectopy include nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, bigeminy, trigeminy, and quadrigeminy. In a large cohort of older men, severity of obstructive versus central sleep apnea appeared to be more closely related to ventricular arrhythmias than atrial fibrillation, as did the extent of hypoxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p>In a cohort study of more than 10,000 patients that identified nadir oxygen saturation as a predictor of sudden cardiac death (SCD), it is noteworthy that 31 percent of those with SCD had definite ventricular arrhythmia as a verified cause, and ventricular ectopy or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was an independent risk factor for SCD among those with OSA (hazard ratio [HR] 4.1, 95% CI 1.6-10.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p>The biologic plausibility of the relationship of OSA with clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias is supported by data demonstrating that OSA is associated with QT prolongation corrected for heart rate in patients with congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), a familial arrhythmogenic cardiac channelopathy associated with prolonged ventricular repolarization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1207100\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preliminary data support a role for positive airway pressure therapy in abolishing nocturnal ventricular asystole and improving other arrhythmias in patients with OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/100,104,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,104,105</a>].</p><p>In a prospective cohort study, a loop recorder capable of monitoring the heart rhythm for 16 months was implanted in 23 patients with moderate or severe OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].

In the absence of OSA or other sleep disorders, sleep is considered to be cardioprotective, typically associated with a nadir of cardiovascular risk.

OSA may be underdiagnosed in this population since typical symptoms of heart failure, such as nocturnal dyspnea and nocturia related to diuretics, may be ascribed to heart failure when they actually represent signs and symptoms of OSA. The pathophysiology of sleep-disordered breathing and heart failure involves a variety of mechanisms including obstructive apneas which increase left ventricular transmural pressures in response to increasingly negative intrathoracic pressure. This results in reduction of left ventricular preload and increased afterload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. Neurohumoral effects involve pulmonary congestion which stimulates pulmonary vagal irritant receptors resulting in hyperventilation and elicitation of central apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. Rostral neck edema is an important factor in both obstructive and central apnea generation in heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>].

An observational study of 83 patients with OSA (defined as clinical suspicion plus an AHI &gt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">events/hour)</span> who underwent pulmonary artery catheterization for unspecified reasons found that one-, four-, and eight-year survival rates were lower among patients with pulmonary hypertension (93, 75, and 43 percent, respectively) than among those without pulmonary hypertension (100, 90, and 76 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>].

The resulting hemodynamic, autonomic, inflammatory, and metabolic effects of this abnormal breathing and arousal pattern may contribute to the pathogenesis of a range of cardiovascular diseases. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although OSA is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, there is no convincing evidence that treatment of OSA with CPAP is associated with a reduction on cardiovascular events as a whole (cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke) has been reported. (See <a href=\"#H3409642565\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular events'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension and OSA frequently coexist. Evidence that OSA may be a cause of hypertension includes the increased prevalence and incidence of hypertension among patients with OSA, an observed dose-response effect between the severity of OSA and the likelihood of hypertension, and the fact that treatment of OSA can lower blood pressure, albeit modestly, but by levels that are clinically significant. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is increasing evidence that severe (but probably not mild) OSA is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events related to coronary heart disease, independent of obesity and other shared risk factors, and that comorbid OSA is a risk factor for worse outcomes in patients with established coronary heart disease. It is not yet clear whether treatment of OSA with positive airway pressure therapy or other modalities can improve outcomes related to coronary heart disease. (See <a href=\"#H1243533\" class=\"local\">'Coronary heart disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with OSA have an increased prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF), compared with the general population and control subjects, and patients with established AF have a high prevalence of comorbid OSA. Limited observational data suggest that OSA may be a modifiable risk factor for recurrent AF after cardioversion or ablation. (See <a href=\"#H1242522\" class=\"local\">'Atrial fibrillation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>OSA has been associated with prolongation of the QT interval in those predisposed to prolonged ventricular repolarization, the latter providing a potential mechanism for the observed sudden nocturnal cardiac death observed in OSA. (See <a href=\"#H1243945\" class=\"local\">'Other arrhythmias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep-disordered breathing is common in patients with heart failure, and OSA and possibly central sleep apnea (CSA) may be risk factors for incident heart failure in men. Bidirectional relationships are likely at play in terms of these sleep-disordered breathing subtypes and heart failure. (See <a href=\"#H27159755\" class=\"local\">'Heart failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary hypertension is present in approximately 20 percent of patients with moderate to severe OSA and may be associated with decreased survival. (See <a href=\"#H1243649\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H389964292\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Renaud Tamisier, MD, and J Woodrow Weiss, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Roca GQ, Redline S, Claggett B, et al.
