The risk of developing an infection and the types of pathogens isolated during infection differ depending upon the underlying disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65091\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65091 \">table 1</a>). The management of children with fever and chronic neutropenic disorders is reviewed here.

This difference is not seen in children with bacteremia, suggesting an intact leukocytic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-fever-in-children-with-non-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

A temperature &ge;38&deg;C (100.4&deg;F) for longer than one hour or two elevations &ge;38&deg;C during a 12-hour period are definitions of fever that also are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-fever-in-children-with-non-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Fever often is the sole sign of occult infection in the neutropenic host. However, this sign may be absent in some infected patients who instead may be hypothermic, hypotensive, listless, or confused. Thus, infection must be considered and treated empirically if any signs of clinical deterioration are present in a neutropenic child, regardless of the recorded temperature.</p><p>Measuring the temperature orally is preferred, although an axillary temperature is acceptable if the patient is unable to use an oral thermometer. Generally, no adjustment is made when comparing axillary and oral temperatures. However, more conservative guidelines suggest that adding 0.5&deg;F (0.3&deg;C) to the axillary temperature reading may be warranted. Because of associated risks of mucosal trauma and bacteremia, measurement of rectal temperature should be avoided in neutropenic patients. Infected children who are receiving glucocorticoids may present with lower <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intermittent temperature elevation &ndash; or may be afebrile.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6211924\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk category</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of infection among children with non-chemotherapy-induced neutropenia can be categorized as low, low to moderate, and high, based upon the clinical appearance and underlying disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65091\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65091 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low risk &ndash; Otherwise healthy, well-appearing child with transient, isolated neutropenia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low to moderate risk &ndash; Well-appearing child with chronic benign neutropenia or cyclic neutropenia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High risk &ndash; Ill-appearing child with neutropenia (of any etiology); well- or ill-appearing child with severe congenital neutropenia (Kostmann syndrome) or aplastic anemia; children with a previous episode of complicated febrile illness or life-threatening infection</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with fever and neutropenia should be evaluated promptly because they may be at substantial risk of developing a life-threatening infection. In ill-appearing patients or those at highest risk of infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65091\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65091 \">table 1</a>), the evaluation ideally should occur at a hospital with subspecialty services or at a facility that can arrange for transport to such a facility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H736498159\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important aspects of the history in a child with fever and neutropenia include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-fever-in-children-with-non-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New site-specific symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antimicrobial prophylaxis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection exposures, including illness (eg, cough, influenza, etc) in family members</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of documented infections or colonization</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concomitant noninfectious cause of fever (eg, receipt of blood products)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Underlying comorbid conditions (eg, diabetes, recent surgery)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of intravascular catheters or other devices</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunization history (deficient immunizations or questionable immunization history)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete physical examination should be performed, with particular attention to common sites of infection, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin, especially folds, areas surrounding nail beds, and central venous catheter sites including the subcutaneous tunnel, if present</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinuses; sinus tenderness should be evaluated</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oropharynx, especially the gingival line and buccal mucosa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lungs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdomen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perineum, especially the perianal and labial regions</p><p/><p>Mild erythema or tenderness should not be ignored because signs of inflammation in the neutropenic patient may be subtle. <strong>Periodic repeated physical examinations are essential</strong>.

It is particularly important that the blood culture be obtained without delay in ill-appearing patients and those at highest risk of serious bacterial infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65091\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65091 \">table 1</a>). Anaerobic blood culture may be warranted patients with abdominal signs and symptoms, particularly abdominal pain, and in patients with buccal and perianal infections. A blood culture should be obtained from central catheter ports when such access is available. Opinions vary as to whether blood should also be cultured from peripheral sites in these patients and practices vary from institution to institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-fever-in-children-with-non-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. The rationale for culturing both peripheral and central sites is to differentiate a catheter-related infection from bacteremia from another source.</p><p>In addition to providing information necessary for diagnosing catheter-related blood stream infection, obtaining more than one blood culture can be helpful in distinguishing between blood culture contamination and true blood stream infection. As an example, true bacteremia is more likely when coagulase-negative staphylococci are isolated from two or more blood cultures than from a single culture, which may be reflective of a contaminated specimen.</p><p>The only other site that may be useful to culture routinely is urine in febrile neutropenic girls, especially those younger than three years. In one study, urinary tract infections accounted for 11 percent of all documented infections in febrile neutropenic patients, and 76 percent of these occurred in girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-fever-in-children-with-non-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional studies should be obtained <strong>as clinically indicated</strong>.

The 2017 updated International Pediatric Fever and Neutropenia guidelines for the management of fever and neutropenia in children with cancer and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation provide a weak recommendation against routine use of serum galactomannan to guide initiation of empiric antifungal therapy because of its poor positive predictive value and inability to exclude non-<em>Aspergillus</em> molds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-fever-in-children-with-non-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H736498253\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6211957\"><span class=\"h2\">Guidelines for treatment of fever and neutropenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Guidelines for the management of fever and neutropenia in the cancer patient have been derived from controlled clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-fever-in-children-with-non-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12</a>]. Similar validated therapeutic approaches to fever in the patient with other forms of neutropenia have not been developed because of the rarity of the primary neutropenic disorders. Thus, management of the high-risk patient with chronic neutropenia generally is extrapolated from the care of the patient with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. However, the risk for viral, fungal, and parasitic infections differs depending upon the cause and severity of neutropenia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65091\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65091 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6213838\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The appropriate treatment setting for children with fever and non-chemotherapy-induced neutropenia depends upon their risk of infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65091\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65091 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children at high risk for infection generally are initially treated in the hospital with broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics.

The risk of developing an infection and the types of pathogens isolated differ depending upon the underlying disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65091\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65091 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever in the neutropenic patient may be defined as a single oral or axillary temperature &ge;38.3&deg;C (101&deg;F), a temperature &ge;38&deg;C (100.4&deg;F) for longer than one hour, or two elevations &ge;38&deg;C during a 12-hour period. Measuring the temperature orally is preferred in neutropenic patients; rectal thermometry should be avoided. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Fever'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with fever and neutropenia should be evaluated promptly because they may be at substantial risk of developing a life-threatening infection. Serial examination of the most common sites of infection (eg, skin, sinuses, oropharynx, lungs, abdomen, and perineum) is essential. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blood culture should be obtained without delay. We also suggest that a urine culture be obtained in febrile girls with neutropenia. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Cultures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional studies (eg, chest radiograph, viral studies, stool studies) should be obtained as clinically indicated. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Additional studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to the treatment of fever in the high-risk child with non-chemotherapy-induced neutropenia typically parallels that for the child with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fever in children with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with fever and non-chemotherapy-induced neutropenia who are at high risk for bacterial infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65091\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65091 \">table 1</a>), we recommend prompt initiation of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Empiric therapy should ensure both gram-negative and gram-positive coverage. The choice of antibiotic is guided by the site of infection if a specific infection is present. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Suggested initial regimens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For uncomplicated fever episodes (ie, fever without hemodynamic instability, gastrointestinal symptoms, neurologic or mental status changes, concern for catheter infection, pneumonia, or skin or soft tissue infection), we suggest monotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cefepime</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">meropenem</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H84649247\" class=\"local\">'Uncomplicated fever episodes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For hemodynamically unstable children, we suggest empiric combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vancomycin</a>, an aminoglycoside (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">gentamicin</a>), and a broad-spectrum antipseudomonal agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cefepime</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). If a multiply-drug-resistant gram-negative infection is suspected, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">meropenem</a> should be initiated while the results of cultures are pending. Once the pathogen causing illness has been identified and susceptibility data are known, definitive monotherapy based on susceptibility results is appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H84649024\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic instability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For children with abdominal symptoms, particularly abdominal pain or blood per rectum, we suggest the use of an antibiotic with activity against anaerobes (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Acceptable regimens include monotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">meropenem</a>; as an alternative, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metronidazole</a> may be added to other broad-spectrum coverage to provide activity against anaerobes. (See <a href=\"#H25528788\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vancomycin</a> should be reserved for febrile neutropenic patients with (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Vancomycin'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypotension or other signs of cardiopulmonary deterioration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Radiographically documented pneumonia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Evidence of meningitis or new onset of neurologic signs and symptoms suggestive of meningitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Clinically suspected central venous catheter site infection (eg, chills or rigors with infusion through the catheter and cellulitis around the catheter entry or exit site)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Skin or soft tissue infection at any site</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Known colonization with methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA), or penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When a blood culture is reported to be growing gram-positive bacteria, and identification and susceptibility testing are pending</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial empiric regimen should be modified if there is a change in clinical status or vital signs, fever persists for &gt;48 hours, an organism is isolated from the blood, the patient develops signs or symptoms of a localized infection, or there is recurrent fever after initial defervescence. In addition, for those patients in whom a site of infection has been defined and in whom fever has resolved, therapy can be adjusted to the most appropriate treatment for the particular infection. (See <a href=\"#H7428430\" class=\"local\">'Modifications to initial regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that antifungal therapy be administered to patients who remain febrile and profoundly neutropenic after four to seven days of broad-spectrum antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Antifungal therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The duration of antimicrobial therapy is determined by the site of infection (eg, pneumonia, cellulitis), the clinical response (including resolution of fever) and the pathogen identified. When the source of the fever remains unknown, empiric antibiotic therapy (with the exception of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vancomycin</a>) usually is continued until clinical response and, preferably, until bone marrow production of granulocytes has recovered. Empiric vancomycin should be discontinued after 48 to 72 hours if there continues to be no clinical focus of infection and no pathogens have been identified in cultures.
