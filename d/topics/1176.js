The underlying mechanism is global hypoperfusion of both the cerebral cortices or focal hypoperfusion of the reticular activating system. It is not to be confused with loss of consciousness associated with altered mental status or stroke and similarly in vague dizziness and chronic lightheadedness in patients with pre-syncope. To address this issue an international consortium gathered to define syncope and standardize the reporting of outcomes to guide future research [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Syncope is a common complaint in the emergency department (ED), accounting for 1 to 3 percent of all ED visits and hospital admissions in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. Although most potential causes are benign and self-limited, others are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The differential diagnosis is broad, and management focuses on the underlying cause when this is discernible. However, during the ED evaluation the cause of syncope often remains unclear and management must focus on risk stratification to differentiate among patients safe for discharge and those who require emergent investigation and in-hospital management. Presyncope (ie, near loss of consciousness) and true syncope should be considered a spectrum of the same symptom. Although near syncope is less dramatic and some of the studies and guidelines about its significance less compelling, clinicians should approach them in similar fashion.</p><p>When researchers have made a clear effort to distinguish true presyncope from dizziness and vague lightheadedness the outcomes of syncope and near or presyncope parallel on another in terms of significant underlying causes and serious outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In a recent study, researchers in Canada specifically addressed a presyncopal cohort and concluded that patients with pre-syncope can have significant underlying causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>This topic review will discuss how to evaluate and manage patients presenting to the ED with syncope. Detailed discussions of specific types of syncope and the evaluation of syncope in children and adults are found elsewhere.

After reviewing the history, physical examination, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) physicians in the ED are able to determine a clear underlying diagnosis only about 50 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Patients often remain undiagnosed despite exhaustive diagnostic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/4,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11</a>]. Tables listing the most dangerous and most common etiologies of syncope are provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81820\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81820 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62074\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62074 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F108983\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108983 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Life-threatening conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary responsibility of the emergency clinician is to assess whether a life-threatening cause of syncope is present, and to provide appropriate management and disposition. The most important causes to consider are: cardiac syncope, blood loss, pulmonary embolism, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Other conditions, such as seizure, stroke, and head injury, do not meet the technical definition of syncope but should be considered during the initial assessment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac syncope &ndash; Cardiac causes are the most common life-threatening conditions associated with syncope and thus the most important to diagnose or predict. They include arrhythmia, ischemia, <span class=\"nowrap\">structural/valvular</span> abnormalities (eg, aortic stenosis), cardiac tamponade, and pacemaker malfunction. Prospective studies of short term and one year outcomes following syncope have found patients with cardiac syncope to be at significant risk for sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/3,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12</a>]. Patients with a history of cardiac disease, particularly heart failure, were at greatest risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Important potential causes include: trauma, gastrointestinal bleeding, ruptured aortic aneurysm, ruptured ovarian cyst, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, and ruptured spleen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-the-adult-trauma-patient-and-management-of-non-hemorrhagic-shock\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in the adult trauma patient and management of NON-hemorrhagic shock&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of ruptured ovarian cyst&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-splenic-injury-in-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of splenic injury in the adult trauma patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-symptomatic-non-ruptured-and-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H53322839\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of symptomatic (non-ruptured) and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary embolism &ndash; Hemodynamically significant pulmonary embolism is a relatively uncommon but well documented and important cause of syncope. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism#H456585787\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subarachnoid hemorrhage &ndash; Patients presenting with syncope associated with headache require evaluation for a possible subarachnoid hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Common conditions</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurocardiogenic syncope &ndash; Often referred to as vasovagal or vasodepressor syncope, neurocardiogenic syncope is the most common cause of syncope, accounting for 25 to 65 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients diagnosed with neurocardiogenic syncope have an excellent prognosis with no increase in long-term mortality or morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Autonomic activation causes neurocardiogenic syncope. Three types of responses are seen: a cardioinhibitory response, a vasodepressor response, and a mixed response with features of both. Significant bradycardia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypotension accompany the acute loss of consciousness. Potential triggers are numerous and often determination of the underlying cause is made in the outpatient setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reflex syncope in adults and adolescents: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Most patients with neurocardiogenic syncope experience a prodrome that may include some combination of dizziness or lightheadedness, a sense of warmth, pallor, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, or diaphoresis, associated with some precipitating event. Examples include micturition or defecation syncope, situational syncope (eg, while having blood drawn), or cough-mediated syncope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carotid sinus hypersensitivity &ndash; Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is a variant of neurocardiogenic syncope, resulting from pressure at the carotid sinus. External pressure to the neck can induce this reflex response. Common causes include shaving, a tight collar, and turning of the head. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carotid sinus hypersensitivity and carotid sinus syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orthostasis &ndash; Orthostatic syncope comprises between 5 and 24 percent of syncope cases and can be defined by a drop in blood pressure of more than 20 mmHg, or a reflex tachycardia of more than 20 beats per minute. Orthostasis is most often caused by a loss of intravascular volume, which can be exacerbated by instability of the autonomic nervous system. Nevertheless, clinicians should remain cautious because orthostasis can occur with cardiac syncope. Syncope from orthostatic hypotension should be a diagnosis of exclusion in the emergency department, reserved for low risk patients who have symptoms consistent with the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-causes-and-evaluation-of-orthostatic-hypotension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms, causes, and evaluation of orthostatic hypotension&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Orthostatic vital signs are neither sensitive nor specific in assessing volume status or diagnosing orthostatic syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Symptomatic orthostasis is most important. Many patients become symptomatic if their systolic blood pressure drops below 90 mmHg without a corresponding drop in blood pressure or elevated heart rate to meet the criteria for orthostatic syncope, while a large portion of the population who meets the definition of orthostasis does not have syncope. Elders, pregnant women, and patients taking drugs with vasodilating effects are predisposed to develop symptomatic orthostasis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications &ndash; The effects of medications account for 5 to 15 percent of syncopal events. The mechanism can be orthostasis or cardiotoxicity. Medications often implicated include calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, alpha blockers, nitrates, antiarrhythmics, diuretics (affecting volume status and electrolyte concentrations), and medications affecting the QTc interval (eg, antipsychotics and antiemetics) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62074\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62074 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Other conditions</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic syncope &ndash; True syncope is defined by an immediate, spontaneous return to baseline function following loss of consciousness, without new focal neurologic findings. Thus true neurologic syncope reflecting underlying neurovascular disease is rare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Examples of neurologic syncope include: subarachnoid hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, subclavian steal syndrome, and complex migraine headache. Stroke and transient ischemic attacks generally cause focal neurologic deficits that do not recover rapidly or completely. Often, patients with cerebrovascular disease convey a history of nonsyncopal episodes featuring neurologic deficits. Syncope may be misconstrued as seizure because many patients with transient loss of consciousness have brief convulsive episodes, particularly if bystanders or objects keep them upright. Syncope can usually be differentiated from seizure by the brevity of the convulsions and the lack a true postictal phase. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiologies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and etiologies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychiatric syncope &ndash; Anxiety and panic disorders can cause situational syncope. Emergency clinicians must be cautious when attributing syncope to psychiatric causes. Patients with hypoxia, inadequate cerebral perfusion, or other medical conditions may appear confused or anxious. Patients with psychiatric syncope are generally young, without cardiac disease, and complain of multiple episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug induced loss of consciousness &ndash; Drugs of abuse and alcohol may cause a transient loss of consciousness, but generally these patients manifest signs of toxicity, and do not spontaneously return to normal neurologic function immediately after regaining consciousness. Alcohol can also cause symptomatic orthostasis by impairing vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic &ndash; Metabolic causes of syncope include hypoglycemia and hypoxia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rare causes &ndash; Rare causes of syncope include atrial myxoma, Takayasu's arteritis, systemic mastocytosis, and carcinoid. Anaphylaxis can involve syncope and loss of consciousness, and both patients and witnesses sometimes overlook or forget the more subtle, earlier symptoms, such as flushing, itching, hives, cough, bronchospasm, or abdominal cramping. In addition, these less dramatic symptoms may have resolved by the time the patient is evaluated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough history is essential to determine accurately the underlying cause of syncope. Several studies suggest that history and physical examination lead to the diagnosis in approximately half of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Other studies have assessed specific signs and symptoms to determine which patients are at increased risk for serious outcomes, particularly sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/12,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,21-24</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Young patients are more likely to experience neurocardiogenic syncope. Nevertheless, the emergency clinician must consider the possibility of dysrhythmia, particularly if other concerning factors exist (eg, exertional syncope, family history of sudden death). Electrocardiogram findings consistent with dysrhythmia include a short or prolonged QTc or short PR interval.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Elderly patients appear to be at greater risk for adverse outcomes following syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Elderly patients are more likely to have autonomic dysfunction, orthostasis, and multiple medications, increasing the risk for syncope. However, several studies suggest that while age correlates with death and other adverse outcomes, age itself is nonspecific and a history of underlying heart disease is more predictive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. As an example, one prospective observational study of 45 consecutive patients 50 years and older with syncope found no significant events at one month among those whose emergency department evaluation was unremarkable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].The use of a number of different age thresholds to define the &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; age makes it difficult to interpret the data. One study used 45 years as a cutoff, another 75 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], while consensus opinions have used 60 or 70 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/9,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We believe there is little utility in using any absolute age threshold to determine increased risk. Risk of adverse outcomes after syncope gradually increases with age and should be considered in the context of other risk factors, particularly heart disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated symptoms and triggers &ndash; Concomitant symptoms can provide important diagnostic clues. As an example, chest pain may indicate an acute coronary syndrome or pulmonary embolism. Palpitations suggest an arrhythmia. Dyspnea raises concern for pulmonary embolism or heart failure. Headache raises the possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Symptoms such as headache, paresthesias, or weakness may suggest a neurologic cause.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The emergency clinician should seek a history consistent with neurocardiogenic syncope. If this diagnosis can be made, the patient is low risk. A prodrome generally precedes neurocardiogenic syncope, and often includes a sense of warmth, nausea and vomiting, diaphoresis, and pallor, either just prior to or shortly after the event. Inquiring about potential neurocardiogenic triggers is also helpful. Triggers commonly associated with neurocardiogenic syncope include strong physical or emotional stress, micturition, defecation, coughing, swallowing, and prolonged standing in a warm environment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Position &ndash; Patients who lose consciousness with prolonged standing (ie, minimum of 15 to 20 minutes) are more likely to have neurocardiogenic syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Patients who lose consciousness while moving from a lying to a standing position are more likely to have orthostasis. Syncope while sitting or supine is suspicious for arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/25,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset &ndash; Sudden loss of consciousness without warning or prodrome suggests arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A prospective observational study of patients with recurrent syncope found that 64 percent of patients sustained an arrhythmia at the time of their sudden loss of consciousness when studied with a loop recorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Patients with prodromes are more likely to have neurocardiogenic syncope and have repeatedly been shown to be low risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of symptoms &ndash; The duration of a syncopal event is difficult to quantify. Patients are generally unaware of the duration of their loss of unconsciousness and events are often unwitnessed or poorly quantified if they are witnessed. As a rough guide, an &quot;event&quot; or loss of consciousness persisting for more than four or five minutes should raise concerns for seizure or other causes of altered mental status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exertional syncope &ndash; Syncope with exertion raises the possibility of arrhythmia or cardiac outflow obstruction (eg, aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or pericardial tamponade). These patients warrant a thorough cardiac evaluation, including chest radiograph, electrocardiogram and echocardiography.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizure versus syncope &ndash; Often clinicians have difficulty determining whether their patient suffered a seizure or syncope. Patients with certain seizure disorders do not manifest generalized convulsions, and patients with syncope may have brief <span class=\"nowrap\">tonic/clonic</span> episodes. Approximately 5 to 15 percent of patients thought to have syncope may have a seizure disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Factors suggestive of seizure include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prodrome (aura) different from that described for vasodepressor syncope</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Episode of abrupt onset associated with injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Presence of a tonic phase before the onset of rhythmic clonic activity</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Head deviation or unusual posturing during the episode</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tongue biting (particularly involving the lateral aspect of the tongue)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Loss of bladder or bowel control</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prolonged post event (postictal) phase during which the patient is confused and disoriented</p><p/><p>Despite these guidelines, the differentiation of seizures from syncope can be difficult, especially in the patient with a brief seizure where the postictal phase is minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications &ndash; A review of the patient's medications may reveal the cause of syncope. This is particularly important with elderly patients. Medications often implicated include calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, alpha blockers, nitrates, antiarrhythmics, diuretics (affecting volume status and electrolyte concentrations), and medications affecting the QTc interval (eg, antipsychotics and antiemetics) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62074\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62074 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior episodes &ndash; A history of syncopal episodes may be of value. A single episode or multiple episodes over many years suggests a benign etiology. Several episodes over a short period of time in someone with no history of syncope suggest a more significant cause, such as dysrhythmia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history &ndash; A family history of unexplained sudden death or early cardiovascular disease (ie, in close relatives less than 50 years old) places patients at increased risk for cardiac syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated injury &ndash; Acute loss of consciousness may result in significant injury or events that predispose to injury. Motor vehicle accidents, hip fractures, and subdural hematomas can result. Emergency clinicians should assess the patient for potential injuries. Although patients with prodromal symptoms have less risk of death and other adverse outcomes following syncope, there is no evidence they have less risk of acute injury from syncope (eg, from falls). Such patients may ignore warning signs and may be just as likely to incur injury as patients without a prodrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical exam should focus on vital signs and a focused cardiac and neurologic exam, as well as any specific complaints.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vital signs &ndash; Transient hypotension or bradycardia occur during most syncopal events.

In patients with active bleeding or suspected anemia, a hematocrit should be obtained, and coagulation studies may be useful.

Natriuretic peptides and troponin are markers, respectively, for heart failure and ischemic heart disease, both of which are established risk factors for adverse events following syncope. In addition, BNP may be chronically elevated in some patients with a history of heart failure. None of the studies included in the review described above looked at the value of obtaining a BNP or high-sensitive troponin routinely in addition to a careful history and physical examination in all patients presenting to the ED with syncope.

Emergency department (ED) clinicians should keep in mind that despite exhaustive testing a clear diagnosis will ultimately not be found for many patients with syncope. A subset of these patients may have occult cardiac syncope.</p><p>When evaluating the syncope patient, emergency clinicians should keep in mind three questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is this true syncope or does some other serious condition account for the patient's loss of consciousness (eg, stroke, seizure, head injury)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If this is true syncope, is there a clear life-threatening cause?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If this is true syncope and the cause is not clear, is the patient at high risk?</p><p/><p>Life-threatening causes of syncope include: hemorrhage (eg, gastrointestinal, subarachnoid), pulmonary embolism, and cardiac syncope from arrhythmia or acute coronary syndrome.</p><p>Patients with syncope from major hemorrhage usually have a low hematocrit. This may not be the case if bleeding is severe and acute, in which case the hematocrit can be misleading. Gastrointestinal bleeding is the most common cause, and often the rectal exam or a stool guaiac test will be positive for blood. The emergency clinician must consider other sources of hemorrhage, including: ruptured aortic aneurysm, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, ruptured ovarian cyst, and ruptured spleen. Appropriate diagnostic testing should be performed. Obtain a pregnancy test in all women of child-bearing age. Bedside ultrasound can be invaluable in determining the presence of abdominal aortic aneurysm, ectopic pregnancy, and intraabdominal blood.

Patients with pulmonary embolism often present with dyspnea and chest pain, and may be hypoxic. An electrocardiogram (ECG) with evidence of right heart strain is suggestive. Most often the diagnosis is made by helical CT scan. When suspecting PE, clinicians should perform a work-up based on the patient's baseline risk. Evaluation and management of pulmonary embolus are discussed separately. Patients whose presenting symptom of pulmonary embolism is syncope are not at increased risk of death compared with other patients with pulmonary embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].

Should historical features or examination findings suggest transient ischemic attack or stroke, clinicians should obtain a CT with angiography or MRI, and neurologic consultation. Suspected seizure should be evaluated with neuroimaging (head CT or MRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG), as an in-patient or out-patient. A less extensive evaluation may be appropriate for patients with an established seizure diagnosis and no concerning features in their presentation.

We suggest clinicians obtain an ECG in all syncope patients. The emergency clinician should study the ECG for evidence of ischemia, arrhythmia, and conduction abnormalities. An abnormal ECG or concerning history should prompt further workup, including echocardiography and cardiac monitoring as indicated.

Syncope patients should be placed on a cardiac monitor while evaluated in the ED. Myocardial infarction (MI) is a rare but important cause of syncope. Most such patients have atypical presentations without ST segment elevations on initial ECG's. MI occurs in about 3 percent of patients with syncope and the negative predictive value of a &quot;normal&quot; ECG is greater than 99 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Several historical factors raise concern for cardiac syncope, including: a strong family history (eg, close relative with sudden death or MI before 50 years old), a history of heart disease (eg, heart failure, MI, valvular disease, arrhythmia), and symptoms consistent with heart disease (eg, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath).</p><p>Examination findings suggestive of cardiac syncope include abnormal vital signs, including orthostatic changes and discrepant pulses or blood pressure, and abnormal heart sounds. If the history or physical examination suggests structural heart disease, an echocardiogram should be obtained. Review the patient's medication list for drugs that may affect the heart rate or rhythm or blood pressure. The elderly and patients taking multiple medications are at greater risk of syncope from medication effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients diagnosed with neurocardiogenic (vasovagal) syncope are at very low risk of adverse outcomes. Historical factors, including a prodrome (eg, sense of warmth, dizziness, pallor, diaphoresis, abdominal pain, or nausea), may suggest the diagnosis. Clinicians may be able to identify potential triggers, such as micturition, defecation, cough, prolonged standing, or a stressful event (eg, blood draw). A history suggestive of neurocardiogenic syncope coupled with an unremarkable physical examination and a normal ECG constitute a reassuring presentation, with little risk of life-threatening complications.</p><p>Note that determining the cause of syncope in patients presenting to the ED can be difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Using a careful history, physical examination, and an electrocardiogram (ECG), along with selective ancillary testing based on clinical findings, clinicians can identify the cause in approximately 50 percent of patients in the ED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

Even 24 to 72 hours of assessment with a Holter monitor, while it diagnoses more arrhythmias, misses important arrhythmias that can only be detected with long term monitors. Newer, portable, longer wear cardiac monitors are available and can easily be applied in the emergency department. The results from prospective observational studies suggest that the time needed to detect an arrhythmia is often longer than that provided by a standard 48 hour Holter monitor and that these newer monitors may improve diagnostic accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK STRATIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emergency clinicians will be unable to determine a diagnosis in a significant number of patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with syncope.

A treatment algorithm is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69774\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69774 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Using the risk factors identified in the studies described below can help clinicians determine patient risk and appropriate disposition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F108983\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108983 \">table 3</a>). While individual studies may be limited by such factors as the size of the cohort, the number of adverse events, and the definition of an event, a consistent theme emerges: patients with an abnormal ECG on presentation or a history of heart disease, particularly structural heart disease (eg, CHF), are at greater risk for adverse outcomes.</p><p>Risk stratification tools should be used to assist clinical judgment, but cannot replace it. When applying such tools, clinicians must be careful to include only appropriate patients. Patients with significant underlying pathology and patients who do not reflect the population in which the risk stratification tool was studied are not appropriate subjects. As examples, a syncope patient with associated acute coronary syndrome may not meet any high risk criteria but obviously requires admission, while patients with loss of consciousness from head trauma or illicit drug use cannot be assessed using a decision rule if such patients were excluded from the rule's derivation and validation studies.</p><p>Several research groups have attempted to identify variables associated with increased risk for short-term and one-year morbidity and mortality following a syncopal episode. According to systematic reviews, each approach has limitations and no one decision rule should be used in isolation to determine patient risk or disposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>].

Significant predictors of adverse events (primarily arrhythmia) included a history of acute decompensated heart failure (ie, congestive heart failure, CHF), an abnormal ECG (nonsinus rhythm or new changes), a hematocrit of less than 30, a complaint of shortness of breath, and a systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mmHg at triage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Further study is needed to determine whether the SFSR can be applied to all ED patient populations. A systematic review of external validation studies of the SFSR found that it is the most thoroughly investigated prediction rule for the assessment of syncope and that validation studies have reported inconsistent results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Such inconsistencies may be due to the use of different definitions for arrhythmia, different definitions for an abnormal ECG, and differences in the clinicians interpreting the tracing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The OESIL (Osservatorio Epidemiologico sulla Sincope nel Lazio) study group developed a risk score based on predictors of death at one year, which they found to be an abnormal ECG, a history of cardiovascular disease (including heart failure), age over 65, and syncope without prodrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other researchers developed and validated a prediction score for subsequent arrhythmia in patients with unexplained syncope following a standard ED evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. They found the significant variables to be an abnormal ECG, a history of heart failure, and age above 65 years. The prevalence of arrhythmia was nearly identical in each cohort, though each phase of the study was performed in a different country (Switzerland and the United States).</p><p/><p>In addition to the results of these prospective studies, findings from a number of large retrospective studies further support the importance of structural heart disease as an important risk factor for adverse outcome following syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) has published evidence-based guidelines on the management and disposition of patients with syncope. This policy statement is based primarily on the risk stratification data presented above and suggests admission for patients with evidence of acute decompensated (ie, congestive) heart failure or structural heart disease and patients at high risk for adverse outcomes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F108983\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108983 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The American College of Physicians, European Society of Cardiology, American College of Cardiology, and American Heart Association have also established guidelines and algorithms for management and disposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/9,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,36</a>]. A group of international experts created guidelines for the ED management of syncope patients that generally reinforces these guidelines and algorithm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. We suggest emergency clinicians use the ACEP guidelines and the attached ED syncope algorithm, which are better suited to the conditions of their practice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69774\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69774 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>In a study to assess their decision-making, emergency clinicians demonstrated excellent judgment regarding patient risk, but often did not determine disposition based on their judgment, choosing to admit close to 30 percent of patients whom they felt had a less than 2 percent chance of a serious adverse outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The researchers concluded that using clinical judgment augmented by risk stratification may reduce hospital admissions and save some of the estimated two billion dollars spent on syncope each year in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT DISPOSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with obvious cardiac or neurologic causes of syncope, as well as those with concerning symptoms or signs, should be investigated thoroughly in the emergency department (ED) and likely admitted for further in-hospital testing or treatment.

Patients at risk for significant arrhythmias should be admitted to cardiology for pacemaker or automatic implantable defibrillators as indicated. Low risk asymptomatic patients may be discharged, provided out-patient follow-up can be arranged and the clinician has no other concerns. Patients with obvious neurocardiogenic syncope who have returned to baseline and are asymptomatic without injury should be discharged. Outpatient evaluation of syncope, including the use of ambulatory monitors, tilt table testing, and other diagnostic techniques, is discussed in detail separately.

The disposition of intermediate risk patients will vary depending upon local healthcare practice and resources, including the availability of consultants, in-hospital or observation unit beds, and timely outpatient follow-up, the ability to initiate ambulatory monitoring from the emergency department, and risk tolerance. The clinician and patient should discuss the clinical findings and possible approaches, and the patient&rsquo;s goals and preferences should be incorporated into the determination of disposition for those deemed to be at intermediate risk.</p><p>In some emergency departments, patients identified as intermediate risk are managed in a syncope observation unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. In one observational study, 103 consecutive patients presenting to an emergency department with syncope were randomly assigned to standard care or care in a syncope observation unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Patients in the observation unit required fewer admissions and no significant differences in mortality or recurrent syncope were detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-syncope-in-the-emergency-department/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

Conventional therapy consisted of explaining the mechanism underlying fainting and providing advice about lifestyle modifications (eg, avoiding known triggers, increasing fluid and salt intake, lying down when symptoms occur). PCM consisted of one or more of the following: (1) leg crossing combined with tensing of the muscles of the legs, abdomen, and buttocks; (2) arm tensing by grasping one hand with the other and forcibly abducting the arms; or (3) squeezing an object clasped in the dominant hand.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1748756183\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The most important causes to consider are: cardiac syncope, blood loss, pulmonary embolism, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Other conditions, such as seizure, stroke, and head injury, do not meet the technical definition of syncope but should be considered during the initial assessment. An algorithm outlining emergency department management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69774\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69774 \">algorithm 1</a>) and a table listing dangerous causes of syncope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81820\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81820 \">table 1</a>) are provided. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common but less dangerous causes of syncope include: neurocardiogenic, carotid sinus sensitivity, orthostasis, and medication-related (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62074\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62074 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Common conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Historical features that reflect increased risk of a dangerous cause of syncope include: concomitant symptoms (eg, shortness of breath, headache, chest pain), sudden loss of consciousness without prodrome, exertional syncope, older age, and family history of sudden death. The clinician should carefully review the patient's medications. Medication reactions account for a significant percentage of syncopal episodes. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syncope and seizure can be difficult to differentiate. Characteristics to help clinicians make this distinction are described in the text. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform a careful physical examination focusing on vital signs and the neurologic and cardiac examination. Patients with syncope often fall and sustain secondary injuries, which may include the head (eg, subdural hemorrhage), wrist, or hip. Perform a symptom-guided examination looking for injuries. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain an electrocardiogram (ECG) on all syncope patients. Significant findings include: prolonged intervals (QRS, QTc), severe bradycardia, preexcitation, and evidence of myocardial infarction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78397\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78397 \">table 4</a>). Other notable findings include low voltage in the standard limb leads, suggesting pericardial effusion, and abnormal conduction syndromes (eg, Wolf-Parkinson-White, Brugada, and short QT syndromes). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiogram'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergency clinicians rely on information garnered from the history, examination, and ECG to assess the patient with syncope. While performing their assessment, they should keep in mind three questions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69774\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69774 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Is this true syncope or does some other serious condition account for the patient's loss of consciousness (eg, stroke, seizure, head injury)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If this is true syncope, is there a clear life-threatening cause?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If this is true syncope and the cause is not clear, is the patient at high risk? (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with obvious cardiac or neurologic causes of syncope, as well as those with concerning symptoms or signs, should be investigated thoroughly in the ED and likely admitted to inpatient or observation units. Patients with obvious neurocardiogenic syncope who have returned to baseline and are asymptomatic without injury can be discharged. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Patient disposition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For well-appearing asymptomatic patients with an unclear cause, clinicians should determine the risk for adverse outcome. Clinicians determine risk on the basis of patient history, examination and electrocardiogram (ECG) findings, and evidence-based guidelines. We suggest augmenting clinical judgment with validated decision tools. A composite table of high risk features based on findings from several studies is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F108983\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108983 \">table 3</a>). High risk patients should be investigated in the ED and likely admitted. Low risk asymptomatic patients may be discharged, with appropriate outpatient follow-up. The disposition of intermediate risk patients will vary depending upon local healthcare practice and resources, including the availability of consultants and timely outpatient follow-up, the ability to initiate ambulatory monitoring from the emergency department, and risk tolerance. Patient goals and preferences should be incorporated into the determination of disposition for those deemed to be at intermediate risk.
