In this situation, increases in serum PSA over the baseline after initial treatment are not accompanied by symptoms or signs of locally recurrent or metastatic disease. Many of these men are relatively young and otherwise healthy. For men in whom there is a significant likelihood that disease is confined to the prostate gland, salvage therapy may result in prolonged disease-free survival (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F100471\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100471 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a confirmed rise in serum PSA following prior definitive radiation therapy (RT), careful evaluation is required to rule out the possibility of distant metastases.

Thus, serum PSA levels are unlikely to fall to undetectable levels following a course of RT.</p><p>The most widely accepted definition is the so-called Phoenix criteria, established by the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-after-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer-salvage-local-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. According to this definition, a PSA rise of &ge;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> above the nadir PSA is considered a biochemical failure in a man who was previously treated with definitive RT, with or without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Although an increase of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or more is defined as a biochemical relapse, repeat confirmation is generally carried out to rule out a PSA bounce.

The decision of whether or not to proceed to local salvage therapy requires a consideration of the likelihood that disease is locally confined, in combination with an assessment of the patient's age and overall health. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinical and pathologic parameters at the time of original diagnosis, as well as subsequent events, are helpful in predicting those men who are most likely to benefit from aggressive salvage therapy and least likely to develop distant metastases and die from their disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men who were classified as high-risk at their original presentation are at increased risk for developing distant disease following initial therapy and are less likely to benefit from local salvage therapy. In particular, this includes men who originally had histologic grade group 4 or 5 (Gleason score &ge;8), a clinical tumor stage &ge;T2c, or a serum PSA level &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-after-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer-salvage-local-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

As an example, in one study, a PSA doubling time &lt;8 months was associated with a 54 percent risk of distant metastases at seven years, and in another report a PSA doubling time &lt;3 months correlated with a 49 percent risk of distant metastases at three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-after-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer-salvage-local-therapy/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A serum PSA &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> at the time of evaluation for salvage therapy correlates with a poorer outcome following therapy for a PSA-only recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-after-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer-salvage-local-therapy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p/><p>Although long-term outcomes are better with early treatment for a PSA-only recurrence, these results may reflect the natural history of the disease and do not necessarily reflect a benefit from therapy. Men with a PSA-only relapse and relatively low PSA levels (particularly those with a low Gleason score, clinical stage T1 or T2 tumors, a long PSA doubling time, and a long interval to PSA recurrence) are more likely to have a prolonged disease course even without treatment. The lack of randomized trials comparing surgery or another form of local therapy versus observation makes it difficult to know whether these men would have remained free of clinical metastases even without salvage therapy.

There are no randomized trials that compare different therapeutic options (ie, radical prostatectomy, cryotherapy, brachytherapy) with each other or with observation in this setting. A systematic review of the literature found biochemical response rates to be similar with different modalities, although there are differences in toxicity profiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-after-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer-salvage-local-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In the era of improved multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate, it might be tempting to offer salvage therapy based on MRI alone, but this is not recommended, and biopsy confirmation of a local recurrence remains indicated.</p><p>High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has also been used as salvage therapy for the treatment of biopsy-proven recurrent prostate cancer following radiation therapy (RT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-after-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer-salvage-local-therapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In the pre-PSA era, surgery was not widely used because of concerns about operative morbidity and frequent development of disseminated metastases. More contemporary experience utilizing better patient selection criteria and improved operative techniques has made radical prostatectomy an important option for appropriately selected patients, particularly those with a life expectancy of 10 to 15 years or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-after-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer-salvage-local-therapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Although most of the literature is based upon open radical prostatectomy, minimally invasive techniques appear to be an option for experienced surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-after-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer-salvage-local-therapy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

These included rectal injury, bladder neck contractures, hemorrhage, ureteral injury, vesicorectal or vesicoperineal fistulas, venous thromboembolism, and chronic urinary incontinence.</p><p>These series included many patients who had undergone staging pelvic lymph node dissection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> open radioactive seed implantation. The degree of fibrosis after modern conformal external beam RT or transperineal brachytherapy is much less, permitting the majority of men to undergo a salvage operation that is similar to the standard nonsalvage prostatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-after-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer-salvage-local-therapy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

These rates are substantially higher than those observed after radical prostatectomy as initial therapy. This may reflect the persistence of radiation-induced sphincter dysfunction. When the assessment is based upon patient-reported data, even higher rates of incontinence have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-after-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer-salvage-local-therapy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Brachytherapy is typically given by a low-dose rate methodology using iodine-125 (I-125) or palladium-103 (Pd-103) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-after-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer-salvage-local-therapy/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>], but can also be given using a high-dose rate technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-after-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer-salvage-local-therapy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

The results with brachytherapy are illustrated by the following retrospective observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the largest series, 49 men with biopsy-proven local recurrence after external beam RT underwent salvage low-dose rate brachytherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-after-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer-salvage-local-therapy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. At 64 months average follow-up, the biochemical relapse-free survival rates at three and five years were 48 and 34 percent, respectively. Men whose PSA nadir was &lt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> after salvage brachytherapy (47 percent of the cohort) fared better than those whose nadir was higher (five-year biochemical relapse-free survival 56 versus 15 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the series with the longest follow-up, 37 men were treated with low-dose rate brachytherapy after initial RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-after-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer-salvage-local-therapy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. At a median follow-up of seven years, the 10-year freedom from biochemical failure and cancer specific survival rates were 54 and 96 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the largest reported series using high-dose rate brachytherapy, 21 men were treated for recurrent prostate cancer after external beam RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-after-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer-salvage-local-therapy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. At a median follow-up of 60 months, the five-year biochemical control rate was 51 percent.

Evidence of a further biochemical recurrence is not uncommon in this situation.</p><p>The primary approach to management of a subsequent biochemical recurrence is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The optimal timing for the initiation of ADT in this situation is not clear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-after-treatment-for-localized-prostate-cancer-systemic-therapy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA after treatment for localized prostate cancer: Systemic therapy&quot;, section on 'Androgen deprivation therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The routine monitoring of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after treatment of early stage prostate cancer has led to the identification of men with a PSA-only (biochemical) recurrence without symptoms or signs of locally recurrent or disseminated prostate cancer. The most widely accepted definition of biochemical failure following radiation therapy (RT) is the Phoenix criteria. According to this definition, a PSA rise of &ge;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> above the nadir PSA following definitive RT (external beam or brachytherapy) is considered a biochemical failure. (See <a href=\"#H81458203\" class=\"local\">'Definition of biochemical failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Men meeting the Phoenix criteria for biochemical recurrence should only be considered for salvage therapy in the absence of disseminated disease and after tissue confirmation of recurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rising-serum-psa-following-local-therapy-for-prostate-cancer-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rising serum PSA following local therapy for prostate cancer: Diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men with a positive prostate biopsy more than 18 months after RT and no evidence of disseminated disease after definitive RT as their initial treatment, there are no clinical trials that define the optimal therapeutic approach. Standard options include observation or definitive therapy (radical prostatectomy, cryotherapy, brachytherapy). Key factors in choosing an approach include age, comorbidity, and patient preferences. The choice of a specific intervention should also consider the available experience and expertise.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-serum-psa-after-radiation-therapy-for-localized-prostate-cancer-salvage-local-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Roach M 3rd, Hanks G, Thames H Jr, et al.
