In the US, it is the most commonly reported bacterial infection and a common cause of urethritis in men and cervicitis in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The largely asymptomatic reservoir of infections provides an ongoing source for efficient disease transmission and also allows for silent disease. <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection can result in scarring of the Fallopian tubes, ovaries, endometrial lining, and occasionally, the adjacent perineum, which increases the risk of future ectopic pregnancy and tubal infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These consequences are the main reason that <em>C. trachomatis </em>is estimated to be the most costly nonviral sexually transmitted infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. With this in mind, screening programs aimed at preventing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women began in the late 1980s in the US, and were formally endorsed by the US Preventive Screening Task Force (USPSTF) and other major organization in the mid-1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other countries also have national chlamydia screening programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The epidemiology of <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection in adolescents and adults is discussed in this topic. The screening, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of chlamydial infections in adolescents and adults are discussed in detail elsewhere.

It has a distinct life-cycle consisting of two major phases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The small elementary bodies attach and penetrate into cells, changing into the metabolically active form, called the reticulate body, within six to eight hours. These forms create large inclusions within cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The reticulate bodies then reorganize into small elementary bodies, and within two to three days the cell ruptures, releasing newly formed elementary bodies. Release of the elementary bodies initiates the replicative process, since this is the form that can infect new epithelial cells. The long growth cycle explains why treatment with agents with long half-lives or a prolonged course of antibiotics is necessary to eradicate infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Chlamydia cannot be cultured on artificial media; tissue culture is required to grow the organism. Culture methods are now limited to research and reference laboratories in favor of more sensitive and practical diagnostic methods. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections#H22688671\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infections&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis of chlamydial infections'</a>.) </p><p>One critical feature of chlamydial organisms is that immunity to infection is not long-lived. As a result, reinfection or persistent infection is common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H662314833\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most countries, <em>C. trachomatis</em> infections among adults and adolescents are virtually all sexually transmitted. The risk of transmitting <em>C. trachomatis</em> from an infected individual to an uninfected one has been difficult to establish. In a study that included 101 couples in which at least 1 partner was diagnosed with chlamydia by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 53 percent of the other partners also had chlamydia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The rate of transmission from female to male and from male to female appeared to be equivalent. Unfortunately, more specific data on the likelihood of infection after a known exposure or rates of transmission from symptomatic versus asymptomatic persons are not available. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H577206010\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE AND INCIDENCE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10758584\"><span class=\"h2\">United States</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H577206229\"><span class=\"h3\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>C. trachomatis</em> is the most commonly reported bacterial infection in the US. In 2016, 1,598,354 chlamydial infections were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), reflecting an incidence rate of 497.3 cases per 100,000 people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This was the highest number of cases of any disease ever reported to the CDC over the course of one year. The rate in women and men overall increased by 2.9 and 26.8 percent, respectively, from 2012 to 2016. Nevertheless, the rate of infection among women has remained more than twice that among men (657.3 versus 330.5 cases per 100,000 persons), probably because women are considerably more likely to be screened than men. The increase in the chlamydia rate among men over time suggests that more men are probably being tested as urine-based assays are increasingly used.</p><p>Since the majority of urogenital <em>C. trachomatis</em> infections are asymptomatic, these rates undoubtedly underestimate the true burden of disease. Moreover, there has been considerable debate as to how much of the apparent increase in disease burden is related to enhanced screening efforts and whether there is a true increase in the incidence of infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H577206235\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some features of chlamydia epidemiology have remained constant since surveillance was initiated in the US. Prevalence is consistently highest among young women (15 to 24 years of age), whereas rates peak among men at a slightly older age (20 to 24 years) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F94517\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94517 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In one prospective study of 14,322 individuals between the ages of 18 and 26 years, the prevalence of chlamydia was 4.2 percent and, overall, was higher among women than men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The highest rates were in African American women (14 percent). In a study of a sample of households in the US conducted from 2007 to 2012 as a part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the prevalence of chlamydia was 1.7 percent among participants ranging in age from 14 to 39 years; this corresponded to 1.8 million prevalent infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The overall prevalence in this study was slightly higher among women than men (2 versus 1.4 percent). Among sexually active women, the prevalence increased with decreasing age. </p><p>Among both men and women, race, ethnicity, economic disadvantage, and geographic region also modify the likelihood of infection being detected. As an example, the prevalence among black individuals reported in 2015 was almost six times that among white individuals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F97570\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97570 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. State-specific prevalence was highest in Alaska, where disease is heavily focused in the Native Alaskan population. In a separate analysis, Native Alaskans and American Indians were estimated to have an incidence of chlamydia 1.4 times higher than the US average in 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Among women nationwide, prevalence was particularly high among women aged 16 to 24 years who entered the National Job Training Program, an educational program for socioeconomically disadvantaged youth; median state-specific prevalence was 11.0 percent (range 5.5 to 19.4 percent). Among men entering this program, median state-specific prevalence was 7.0 percent (range 0.6 to 13.5 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H662314517\"><span class=\"h2\">Worldwide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chlamydia is a common infection worldwide. In general, the age-specific prevalence described in the US, with younger individuals bearing the brunt of the disease, also appears evident in other countries, although systematically collected, nationally representative data are limited in lower resource countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated the global prevalence of several sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among individuals aged 15 to 49 years based on data from regions that have good case-based surveillance systems as well as data from population-based studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In 2008, there were an estimated 100 million prevalent cases and an estimated 105.7 million incident cases of chlamydia that occurred worldwide, which represented a 4.1 percent increase in new cases compared with the previous comprehensive assessment in 2005. The degree to which improved diagnostics and increased availability of chlamydia diagnostics in resource-limited settings have influenced this reported increase is unknown.</p><p>However, in support of the general increasing global trend in genital chlamydia, population-based studies in certain regions also demonstrate a surprisingly high prevalence of <em>C. trachomatis</em>. In an observational study of almost 3500 individuals in China randomly selected by region to provide a nationally representative sampling, the estimated prevalence of <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection was 2.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a population-based screening study in the Netherlands, in which 21,000 men and women ages 15 to 29 years underwent home based urine testing, the prevalence of Chlamydia was 2.6 percent in women and 2.0 percent in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>One interesting feature of <em>C. trachomatis</em> global<em> </em>epidemiology is the so-called Swedish new variant, first reported in 2006 in Sweden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This variant contained a mutation so that nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) used at the time of its emergence did not detect the microorganism. This diagnostic test failure allowed infections caused by this strain to go undiagnosed, leading to a nationwide network of related infections. Subsequent modification of testing protocols has resulted in a relatively lower proportion of chlamydial infections due to this strain, and it remains rarely reported beyond the Nordic countries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H320339991\"><span class=\"h2\">Extragenital infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extragenital sites are not typically specified in surveillance studies of <em>C. trachomatis</em> in heterosexual populations, but may serve as reservoirs for ongoing transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. As an example, in a study of 4402 women attending a Baltimore STI clinic, the prevalence of rectally detected <em>C. trachomatis</em> was 3.7 percent; 13.8 percent of all chlamydial infections in women would have been missed with testing only at urogenital sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Age &le;18 years was the strongest predictor of rectal infections in women. These data have not yet prompted recommendations to screen women at the rectal site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10758621\" class=\"local\">'Selective screening'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1092027694\"><span class=\"h1\">COINFECTION WITH OTHER PATHOGENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Co-infections with <em>C. trachomatis</em> and other urogenital sexually transmitted pathogens have frequently been reported among high-risk men and women. As an example, in a study of men with urethritis, 35 percent of those with <em>C. trachomatis </em>were also infected with <em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In certain high-risk populations, such as adolescents entering juvenile detention centers, reported rates of coinfection with <em>C. trachomatis</em> and <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> have been as high as 50 percent, but appear to be considerably lower in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Trichomoniasis is especially prevalent in sexually active women, and may also occur with <em>C. trachomatis </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These findings highlight the importance of evaluation for other sexually transmitted infections, particularly <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> in patients with known <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection.

Some experts believe that a decline in prevalence with age may be related to development of partial immunity through periodic repeated exposures, in addition to changes in behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Report of a new sex partner or more than one sex partner in the prior three months &mdash; These are not specific for <em>C.</em> <em>trachomatis</em>, but denote a risk for common sexually transmitted infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of previous <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection &mdash; This is a highly predictive factor for newly detected infection, probably because it identifies persons at high risk for reinfection from a previously untreated sex partner or from a new partner involved in the same sexual network as the original source partner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10758596\" class=\"local\">'Risk of repeat infection'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inconsistent use of condoms &mdash; Although report of inconsistent condom use is often associated epidemiologically with increased likelihood of infection, the utility of this history to assess risk for the individual is limited.</p><p/><p>History of a different sexually transmitted infection (STI), including HIV, is also associated with a higher risk of chlamydia. (See <a href=\"#H10758596\" class=\"local\">'Risk of repeat infection'</a> below.)</p><p>Socioeconomic and racial disparities also exist with chlamydia prevalence, with higher prevalences noted among certain ethnic minorities and among socioeconomically disadvantaged youth. (See <a href=\"#H577206235\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p>In general, less is known about the risk factors for chlamydia in men than in women. There is a high prevalence of both genital and extragenital chlamydia among men who have sex with men (MSM) (see <a href=\"#H10758608\" class=\"local\">'Risk in men who have sex with men'</a> below). Other risk factors may be similar to those in women. In a population-based study from the Netherlands, infection in men was associated with young age, multiple sex partners, <span class=\"nowrap\">low/intermediate</span> education status, and infrequent condom use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a population-based study from China, unprotected sex with a commercial sex worker was a significant risk factor for infection among men aged 20 to 44 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10758596\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of repeat infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several prospective studies have documented high rates of repeat infection in the months after an initial chlamydial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. </p><p>In one rigorous study, participants with <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection underwent a test-of-cure approximately 30 days after antibiotic treatment in order to document successful therapy before returning at three months for repeat screening. In this way, repeat infection could be distinguished from treatment failure. In a study of 272 men aged 15 to 35 years, diagnosed with chlamydia, and subsequently followed for four months in three urban sites in the US (Baltimore, Denver, and San Francisco), repeat infection occurred in 13 percent (an estimated incidence of 45 infections per 100 person-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Among 897 female adolescents diagnosed with an initial <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection at school-based health centers, 236 (26 percent) had one or more subsequent positive tests over the next year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>A prior history of any urogenital sexually transmitted infection (STI) also appears to be associated with a risk of future <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection. An analysis of data on individuals who visited an STI clinic and participated in a counseling trial (Project RESPECT) estimated the incidence of repeat infection during the subsequent year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Among 1236 women, 25.8 percent had one or more new infections (11.9 percent <em>C. trachomatis</em>, 6.3 percent <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>, and 12.8 percent <em>Trichomonas vaginalis</em>), and among 1183 men, 14.7 percent had one or more new infections (9.4 percent acquired <em>C. trachomatis</em> and 7.1 percent <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10758608\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk in men who have sex with men</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to data reported from the 2006-2008 National Survey of Family Growth, 5.2 percent of men aged 15 to 44 reported same sex behavior in their lifetime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].&nbsp;Notably, there is a high incidence and prevalence of STIs, including <em>C. trachomatis</em>, among MSM. As an example, in 2016, the median site-specific prevalence of urogenital <em>C. trachomatis</em> among MSM tested at select STI clinics in the US was 6 percent (range by site: 3 to 15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although this may represent a sampling of a higher risk population, it may also underestimate the total burden of disease since extragenital <em>C. trachomatis</em> infections among MSM are common, asymptomatic, and not frequently sought using recommended diagnostic tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. </p><p>In one study of nearly 22,000 MSM included in a US national STI clinic surveillance network, only 46 percent were tested for rectal chlamydia infection, but 14 percent of those tested were positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Similarly, in another study of MSM screened for chlamydia at urethral, rectal, and pharyngeal sites, rectal infections accounted for 53 percent of chlamydial infections and 86 percent of them were asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In both studies, the majority of men with rectal infections did not have concurrent urethral infection and thus would have missed had urethral testing only been performed. </p><p>In addition to asymptomatic rectal infections, which are most commonly caused by <em>C. trachomatis</em> serovars D-K, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), caused by serovars L1, L2, and L3, can cause symptomatic proctitis in men who engage in receptive anal intercourse with other men. LGV-causing strains of <em>C. trachomatis</em> continue to cause discrete outbreaks of ulcerative proctitis in resource-rich countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. Nearly all cases reported in such outbreaks are among HIV-infected MSM who report unprotected receptive anal sex, and the L2 serovar is the dominant pathogen. As an example, in a study of 1353 MSM with LGV in the UK from 2003 to 2012, 98 percent had symptomatic proctitis (many with either severe or systemic symptoms) and 82 percent were HIV infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In addition, 20 percent were also infected with hepatitis C virus. Although unprotected receptive anal sex is the key risk factor for rectal LGV, other high-risk sexual behaviors, such as sex under the influence of drugs, anonymous sex, and rectal douching, have also been associated with LGV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Additionally, in some studies, a higher proportion of women who have sex with both women and men report high-risk sexual behavior, such as multiple lifetime and recent sexual partners and sex with injection drug users, compared with women who have sex with only men. Nevertheless, even women who have sex exclusively with women remain at risk for STIs, including <em>C. trachomatis</em>.</p><p>In a study of women aged 15 to 24 years attending family planning clinics in the US Pacific Northwest during 1997 through 2005, the rate of <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection was unexpectedly higher among those who reported same sex behavior compared with those who reported exclusively heterosexual behavior (7.1 versus 5.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].&nbsp;Over the study period, women who have sex exclusively with women and reported risky sexual behavioral (new, multiple, or symptomatic sexual partners) had higher chlamydia rates than women who reported similar behavioral risks but have sex with only men or with both men and women.&nbsp;Possible explanations for these observations relate to differences in use of reproductive health care services (including chlamydia screening) by WSW, altered biological susceptibility to lower genital tract infection, infrequent use of barrier methods to prevent STI transmission with female partners, trends towards higher risk behaviors in WSW, and particular characteristics of their respective sexual networks.</p><p>Of note, there were also high chlamydia rates among American Indian and Native Alaskan WSW relative to other races, a finding that is consistent with <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> disparities among women in general. (See <a href=\"#H577206235\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10758621\"><span class=\"h1\">SELECTIVE SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because only the minority of chlamydial infections present as syndromes, including cervicitis, urethritis, proctitis, or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), screening of asymptomatic persons plays a critical role in detecting the majority of infections. Screening for chlamydia is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections#H88323163\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for sexually transmitted infections&quot;, section on 'Chlamydia and gonorrhea'</a>.)</p><p>The premise of selective screening approaches relies on the identification of risks that are specific and sensitive for detection of asymptomatic infection. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Women</strong> &ndash; Most experts agree that selective screening of appropriate women has been associated with widespread declines in reproductive tract sequelae; whether it has affected declines in prevalent infection remains debatable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US Preventive Services Task Force recommend that sexually active women &le;25 years of age be screened for genital chlamydial infection annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Pregnant women should also undergo screening to prevent maternal and neonatal complications. Screening of women older than 25 years is based on behavioral risk criteria. Because women who have sex with women remain at risk for chlamydial infection, sexual orientation should not affect the decision to screen if other risk factors are present. (See <a href=\"#H577206290\" class=\"local\">'Risk of infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are no recommendations to routinely screen for rectal chlamydia infections in women, which are typically asymptomatic, as the adverse consequences of undetected, untreated infection at this site are not known.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Men</strong> &ndash; The major rationale for screening among men is to reduce infection or reinfection of existing partners and transmission to new partners. Given the high rates of chlamydia detection among men who have sex with men (MSM), these men should undergo routine screening of sexually exposed sites (urethra and rectum) (see <a href=\"#H10758608\" class=\"local\">'Risk in men who have sex with men'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Routine screening of HIV-uninfected men who have sex with only women is not recommended unless they are seen in settings with known high prevalence, such as sexually transmitted infection (STIs) clinics or some correctional setting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Individuals with other STIs</strong> &ndash; Other indications for screening include the presence or history of other STIs. HIV-infected individuals should be screened for chlamydia at baseline and at least annually thereafter if sexually active (with more frequent screening if high-risk sexual behavior is reported) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Additionally, individuals diagnosed with chlamydia, gonorrhea, or, in women, trichomonas, are at relatively higher risk of infection with chlamydia in the subsequent several months. Thus, screening for chlamydia several months after a diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis detects substantial numbers of new infections and is recommended as a population-level prevention method. (See <a href=\"#H10758596\" class=\"local\">'Risk of repeat infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Despite recommendations for routine screening, rates of appropriate screening in the above populations remain suboptimal, and interventions to enhance screening in target populations are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. </p><p>Diagnostic testing for screening and treatment of identified infections are discussed elsewhere.
