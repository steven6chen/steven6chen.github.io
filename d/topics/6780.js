The bilirubin can be either unconjugated or conjugated. Conjugated bilirubin is water soluble and is also known as &quot;direct&quot; bilirubin. Disorders causing unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia are more common in children, and are largely distinct from those causing conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. However, some diseases increase both unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin because they affect several different aspects of hepatocyte function.</p><p>This topic will present an overview of the causes of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in children and infants beyond the neonatal period and discuss the evaluation and management of such patients, which varies with the underlying disease.</p><p>The evaluation of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in neonates and the causes and diagnostic approach for the adult with jaundice, which are somewhat different, are discussed separately.

Carotenemia is usually found in infants and toddlers whose diets consist of large amounts of strained yellow vegetables, particularly carrots. Unlike jaundice, the sclerae are not discolored. In carotenemia, the skin color characteristically is more yellow-orange rather than yellow, and more noticeable over the palms and soles (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above). Although the diet is a major cause of carotenemia in childhood, other causes include nephrotic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, anorexia nervosa, liver disease, and hypothyroidism.

Causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia include biliary obstruction (eg, gallstones), liver disease causing hepatocellular dysfunction (eg, hepatitis, sepsis, or hepatotoxic drugs), and several inherited disorders (eg, Dubin Johnson or Rotor syndrome) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55607\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55607 \">table 2</a>).
