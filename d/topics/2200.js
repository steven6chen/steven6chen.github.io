Though the vast majority of headaches are caused by primary headache disorders, more ominous etiologies, such as cerebral neoplasm or metastatic disease, may also be heralded by headache. This topic will review headache related to brain tumors. Other clinical aspects of brain neoplasms are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-brain-tumors-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical features and diagnosis of brain tumors in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-brain-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for brain tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The approach to evaluating headache in adults and children is reviewed elsewhere.

Of note, the brain parenchyma is insensitive to pain. Structures that are sensitive to pain include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The large arteries at the base of the brain and the first few centimeters of their immediate branches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The meningeal arteries</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The large venous channels of the brain and dura</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parts of the dura, including the tentorium and the diaphragma sellae</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cranial nerves that carry pain fibers (V, VII, IX, X)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin and subcutaneous tissue, muscle, vessels, and periosteum of the skull</p><p/><p>Tumors and other mass lesions can cause headache by direct pressure on any of the above structures. Pain arising from the intracranial cavity is a form of visceral pain, and therefore referred to more superficial structures; it is not perceived as coming directly from the compressed region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In general, unilateral lesions refer pain ipsilaterally, supratentorial lesions refer pain to the frontal regions, and posterior fossa masses refer pain to the occiput [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, these associations have poor localizing value in clinical practice. As an example, in a study that evaluated 37 patients with infratentorial tumors, 73 percent of patients had headache in the frontal, temporal, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parietal regions, while nuchal and occipital pain occurred in only 27 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Acute or severe headache from a brain tumor can potentially be caused by elevated intracranial pressure resulting from hydrocephalus, mass effect of the tumor itself, or hemorrhage into or around the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A tumor can distort or displace structures distant from its locale, resulting in referred pain that does not correspond with its location. In such cases of &quot;distant traction,&quot; elevated intracranial pressure may be the cause of the headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, the relationship between elevated intracranial pressure and headache in brain tumor remains uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4463038\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Headache at presentation is observed in approximately 20 percent of patients with brain tumor, and headache occurs during the course of the disease in 48 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Several reports have noted that a prior history of headache is a probable risk factor for headache associated with brain tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], though this may apply only to a longstanding primary headache history and not to a remote history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The most frequent primary intracranial tumors are gliomas, meningiomas, and pituitary adenomas. The most frequent sources of metastatic tumors are lung and breast cancer, followed by malignant melanomas and carcinomas of the kidney, and gastrointestinal tracts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Though headache is a common symptom of brain tumor, it is infrequently seen in isolation, as described in the following sections. Furthermore, among all patients with headache who have normal neurologic examinations, the prevalence of intracranial neoplasm is exceedingly low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In contrast, the prevalence of intracranial involvement is relatively high in patients with known systemic malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of brain metastases&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20626029\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The features of brain tumor headache are generally nonspecific and vary widely with tumor location, size, and rate of growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/6,11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,15</a>]. The headache is usually bilateral, but can be on the side of the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. Supratentorial tumors impinging on structures innervated by the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve may produce a frontotemporal headache, while posterior fossa tumors compressing the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves can cause occipitonuchal pain. There is generally little radiation, except in posterior fossa tumors. Nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting accompany the headache in 40 to 60 percent of adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/5,9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,12</a>]. Headache exacerbation with Valsalva, change in position, or exertion occurs in a substantial minority of patients.</p><p>The evidence regarding the phenotypes of brain tumor headache is inconsistent. In most series, tension-type headache is the most common phenotype in patients presenting with primary or metastatic brain tumors, accounting for 40 to 50 percent of all headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/11,12,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,17,18</a>]. Classic brain tumor headache, atypical migraine-type headache, and worsening of a preexisting headache are less common phenotypes.</p><p>Other studies have also reported tumors that produced migraine-like headaches with visual aura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. In addition, brain tumor headache can also mimic cough or exertional headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], stabbing headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], cluster headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>], cluster variants such as short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform pain with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], orthostatic headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and chronic paroxysmal hemicrania [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Secondary trigeminal autonomic cephalgias appear to have a stronger association with pituitary tumors than other types of brain tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>Though headache is a common symptom of brain tumor, it is infrequently seen in isolation. In the majority of cases, brain tumor headache is associated with other neurologic symptoms such as seizures, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, or focal weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In pediatric patients with brain tumor, isolated headache at presentation has been reported in 0 to 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Among adults, only 2 to 16 percent of patients with brain tumor present with headache alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/12,17,37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,17,37-39</a>]. Isolated headache of more than 10 weeks duration is seldom caused by brain tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>The classic &quot;brain tumor triad,&quot; comprising nocturnal or early morning occurrence, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting,</span> and severe nature, has not been borne out as a typical pattern in modern studies. In one series of 53 adults with brain tumor headache, this triad occurred in only nine patients (17 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Morning worsening of headache was observed in 19 (36 percent). The patients described most headaches as &quot;moderate to severe,&quot; rather than severe. In children, the prevalence of nocturnal or morning headaches appears to be higher than in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/35,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20626036\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor type and location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumor location and pathology may influence the presentation of the headache. Primary brain tumors and metastatic tumors are equally likely to cause headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/12,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,41,42</a>]. In general, slow-growing supratentorial tumors, such as low-grade gliomas, cause headache less frequently than tumors with more rapid growth. With slower-growing tumors, seizures are more common than headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Meningiomas are usually slowly progressive, and cause headaches significantly less often than gliomas. Headache occurs in approximately one-third of patients with supratentorial meningiomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16</a>]. The meninges may also be involved in diffuse tumor infiltration (leptomeningeal carcinomatosis), which results in a generalized headache.</p><p>Tumors in the posterior fossa, such as medulloblastomas and ependymomas, cause headache in 60 to 83 percent of patients, and earlier in the clinical course than supratentorial ones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. Though a study of brainstem gliomas, excluding ependymomas, found only 44 percent of patients with headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], this lower figure might reflect the slower growth of low-grade gliomas or the presence of other symptoms that led to diagnosis before the onset of headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Within the posterior fossa, location seems to be a more important determinant of headache than tumor type, probably because posterior fossa lesions tend to obstruct cerebrospinal fluid pathways early and lead to increased intracranial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Headache is the first symptom of posterior fossa tumors in most cases, with the notable exception of cerebellopontine angle tumors. Many of those tumors are vestibular schwannomas, which usually present with hearing loss or tinnitus before the onset of headache. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tumors in the sellar and parasellar regions, usually pituitary adenomas and craniopharyngiomas, are usually heralded by the presence of visual or endocrine symptoms. Nevertheless, headache is a common accompaniment of pituitary tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In one study of 63 patients with pituitary tumors, the prevalence of headache was 70 percent, but there was no relationship between headache features and pituitary volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In a longitudinal cohort study of 133 consecutive patients with pituitary lesions (mostly macroadenomas), the prevalence of headache was 63 percent, and the group with headache was more likely to be younger, female, and to have a prior history of headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In children, headache is usually the presenting complaint, as they are often unaware of the other symptoms.</p><p>Third ventricle tumors, such as colloid cysts, are associated with paroxysmal headaches. Patients report sudden onset of severe headache, which reflects blockage of the cerebrospinal fluid pathway by the tumor in a ball-valve mechanism. The headache can be worsened or relieved by changes in position. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with thunderclap headache&quot;, section on 'Colloid cyst of the third ventricle'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20626043\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Though only a small minority of patients with headache have brain tumor as the cause, it is crucial to recognize those headache characteristics that are associated with tumors.

In addition, intrathecal infusions of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and cytosine arabinoside can cause aseptic meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. Antiemetics used in conjunction with chemotherapy, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=granisetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">granisetron</a>, are reported to cause headache in 14 to 39 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postcraniotomy headache is another potential complication of brain tumor treatment. One study found that the majority of patients who undergo craniotomy had headaches similar to tension-type headache or site-of-injury headache, most of which resolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Hemicrania continua-like headache has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Surgery can also result in cerebrospinal fluid leakage and subsequent low pressure headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracranial-hypotension-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracranial hypotension: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4462344\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traction on the large blood vessels and dura as well as direct compression of cranial and cervical nerve fibers by the tumor itself are the likely mechanisms for headaches attributed to brain tumors. (See <a href=\"#H4462249\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of headache'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache at presentation is observed in approximately 20 percent of patients with brain tumor, and headache occurs during the course of the disease in 48 to 60 percent. Though headache is a common symptom of brain tumor, it is infrequently seen in isolation. Furthermore, among all patients with headache who have normal neurologic examinations, the prevalence of intracranial neoplasm is very low. (See <a href=\"#H4463038\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Though only a minority of patients with headaches have brain tumor, it is crucial to recognize those headache characteristics that may be more commonly associated with tumors. The features of brain tumor headache are generally nonspecific and vary widely with tumor location, size, and rate of growth. The headache is usually bilateral, but can be on the side of the tumor. Brain tumor headache often resembles tension-type headache, but may resemble migraine or a variety of other headache types. (See <a href=\"#H20626029\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain tumors should be considered in patients presenting with headaches associated with meningismus, focal neurologic signs, fever, or systemic symptoms. New-onset headaches in adults over age 50 should prompt further work-up as well. A prior history of headache does not rule out the possibility of brain tumor, and indeed, a change in headache pattern is a diagnostic &quot;red flag.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H20626043\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the diagnostic test of choice in evaluating for brain tumor, especially if a posterior fossa or dural-based abnormality is suspected. (See <a href=\"#H20626050\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of brain tumor headache depends on tumor type, the patient&rsquo;s functional status, and the extent of disease progression. In cases where treatment is palliative, pain should be managed aggressively with simple analgesics, opioids, glucocorticoids, and the assistance of a palliative care team. (See <a href=\"#H20626071\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/brain-tumor-headache/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Northfield DWC.
