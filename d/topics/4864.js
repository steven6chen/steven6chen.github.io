By age 4, most children can control their bladder and stay dry during the day. But children ages 4 to 6 &ndash; and even older &ndash; can still have &quot;accidents&quot; during the day and wet themselves.</p><p>Daytime wetting can be very upsetting and stressful for children, especially when they go to school or daycare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12826035\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes daytime wetting?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different things can cause daytime wetting, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child's behavior or habits &ndash; For example, children who are very active might wet themselves because they wait too long to use the toilet.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constipation, which is when children have trouble having a bowel movement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary tract problems or infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65630\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65630 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nervous system problems</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12826042\"><span class=\"h1\">Should my child see the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child should see the doctor or nurse if he or she:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is upset or stressed by the daytime wetting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Starts having daytime wetting after he or she was able to stay dry all day before</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has pain when urinating or feels the need to urinate often</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leaks urine after he or she has finished urinating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has many urinary tract infections, constipation, or another condition that could be causing daytime wetting</p><p/><p>The doctor or nurse will talk with you about your child's symptoms and do an exam. He or she might also do a urine test. Before the appointment, he or she might ask you to keep a record for a few days of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much your child drinks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How often your child urinates and has bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the daytime wetting happens</p><p/><p>Most of the time, daytime wetting is not caused by a medical problem. In some cases, though, it is. If your doctor finds a medical problem, he or she might treat the problem, order more tests, or have your child see a specialist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12826049\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to try to stop my child's daytime wetting?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can try different things at home to stop your child's daytime wetting.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make a schedule and have your child urinate every 2 to 3 hours during the day. Give your child rewards for following the schedule.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child follow the doctor's advice about how to sit when urinating.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remind your child not to hold in urine and to urinate before he or she feels the urge to.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child sit for a few minutes after he or she urinates to let all the urine drain from the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid bubble baths or using soap on the genital area (in girls). These can irritate the genital area and worsen daytime wetting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat your child's constipation, if your child is constipated. Ask your doctor or nurse about ways to do this.</p><p/><p>For any of these plans to work, both you and your child must want the daytime wetting to stop. Stopping daytime wetting can be very hard and can take a long time.</p><p>Remember that children cannot help their daytime wetting. You should never punish, tease, or get mad at your child for it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12826056\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there other treatments for daytime wetting?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child still has daytime wetting after trying the tips above, talk with the doctor or nurse.
