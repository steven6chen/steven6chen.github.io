In most instances, the arrhythmia is ventricular tachycardia (VT), but polymorphic VT and ventricular fibrillation (VF) can also result in electrical storm. The arrhythmias can be self-terminating but frequently are terminated using antiarrhythmic drugs or device-related therapies (defibrillation or anti-tachycardia pacing).</p><p>In contrast to repetitive ventricular arrhythmias occurring in electrical storm, incessant VT is defined as hemodynamically stable VT which persists for longer than one hour.</p><p>This topic will discuss the incidence, triggers, clinical significance and treatment of electric storm and incessant VT. The general approach to the diagnosis and management of VT, as well as the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, are discussed separately in various topics.

Rarely, when patients have incessant VT at slower rates (&lt;150 beats per minute), they may remain asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable for days or longer. In such cases, the initial presentation may be heart failure symptoms, suggesting that the incessant VT has resulted in tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy.

In most instances, the arrhythmia is monomorphic VT, but polymorphic VT and ventricular fibrillation (VF) can also result in electrical storm. The definition of electrical storm is different in patients with and without an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When electrical storm is defined by &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> episodes requiring device intervention over a 24-hour period, the incidence is approximately 2 to 10 percent per year follow-up period in patients with ICDs. Monomorphic VT is the predominant ventricular arrhythmia in the vast majority of patients with electrical storm. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13768151\" class=\"local\">'Type of ventricular arrhythmia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common triggers of electrical storm or incessant VT include drug toxicity, electrolyte disturbances, new or worsened heart failure, and acute myocardial ischemia, although a single inciting factor is not identified in the majority of patients. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Triggers of electrical storm'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentations of electrical storm and incessant are highly variable but rarely if ever asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H5922518\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients <strong>without</strong> an ICD, the range of clinical presentations due to electrical storm spans from relatively minor symptoms such as repeated episodes of palpitations, presyncope, or syncope if the patient remains hemodynamically stable to cardiac arrest in those patients with hemodynamically unstable ventricular arrhythmias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients <strong>with</strong> a pre-existing ICD, electrical storm typically presents with multiple ICD therapies (some combination of anti-tachycardia pacing and ICD shocks depending on how the device is programmed to deliver therapy). However, patients with ventricular arrhythmias that are slower than the detection settings of the ICD may present in similar fashion as patients without an ICD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with incessant VT may present with similar symptoms (eg, presyncope, syncope, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, etc), which again will vary depending on the ventricular rate and hemodynamic instability related to the VT. Rarely, when patients have incessant VT at slower rates (&lt;150 beats per minute), the initial presentation may be heart failure symptoms, suggesting that the incessant VT has resulted in tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of electrical storm is made when a patient has three or more confirmed episodes of ventricular tachyarrhythmia resulting in symptoms or ICD therapy within a 24-hour period. Typically the episodes of arrhythmia are confirmed using continuous telemetry monitoring or by reviewing stored intracardiac electrograms from a patient's ICD. The diagnosis of incessant ventricular tachycardia is made by confirming the presence of continuous VT for greater than one hour.
