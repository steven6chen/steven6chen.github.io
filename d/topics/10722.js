It can result from congenital defects in the membrane transport systems of the small intestinal epithelium or from acquired defects in the epithelial absorptive surface. Another factor that can interfere with nutrient absorption is maldigestion, which is due to impaired digestion of nutrients within the intestinal lumen or at the terminal digestive site of the brush border membrane of mucosal epithelial cells.</p><p>Although malabsorption and maldigestion are pathophysiologically different, the processes underlying digestion and absorption are interdependent, so that in clinical practice, the term malabsorption has come to denote derangements in either process.</p><p>Three steps are required for normal nutrient absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-nutrient-absorption-and-malabsorption/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Luminal processing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absorption into the intestinal mucosa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transport into the circulation</p><p/><p>Malabsorption can result from defects in any of these three phases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54743\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54743 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-nutrient-absorption-and-malabsorption/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Furthermore, one or more mechanisms may exist concurrently. Thus, while the clinical sequelae may be the same, the underlying pathophysiology and treatment may be different.</p><p>Malabsorption may either be global or partial (isolated). Global malabsorption results from diseases associated with either diffuse mucosal involvement or a reduced absorptive surface. An example is celiac sprue in which diffuse mucosal disease can lead to impaired absorption of almost all nutrients. Partial or isolated malabsorption results from diseases that interfere with the absorption of specific nutrients. An example is pernicious anemia, a disease that leads to defective cobalamin (vitamin B12) absorption.</p><p>This topic will review the mechanisms leading to the absorption of fats, carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. It will illustrate the many interdependent steps that are required for normal absorption, and some of the various perturbations that can exist leading to malabsorption of these nutrients. The clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of malabsorption are discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76166\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76166 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of malabsorption&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of malabsorption&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FAT ABSORPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most dietary lipids are absorbed in the proximal two-thirds of the jejunum. Absorption is influenced by several factors, including the types of dietary lipids consumed and the presence of other ingested nutrients. In normal children and adults, more than 94 percent of dietary fat is absorbed, although healthy neonates may absorb as little as 85 percent. As a result, on a diet containing 100 grams of fat per day in all but neonates, the presence of &gt;6 grams of fecal fat in a 24-hour collection indicates fat malabsorption.</p><p>Central to the mechanism of fat absorption is the problem of solubilizing lipids in an aqueous environment. The process begins by the generation of a suspension of fat in water, known as an emulsion. Dietary lipids, consisting mostly of triglycerides, must be emulsified to expose a large surface area to lipolytic enzymes. Emulsification begins in the upper gastrointestinal tract through mastication and gastric mixing. Fat droplets released by these mechanical means are coated with phospholipids to form a stable emulsion. Ingested phospholipids (mostly phosphatidylcholine) exist in a ratio to triglycerides of approximately 1:30, which is adequate for coating. Additional phospholipid from bile is added once the emulsion reaches the duodenum.</p><p>Fat hydrolysis begins in the stomach by the actions of lingual lipase, which is secreted from von Ebner's glands near the circumvallate papillae, and gastric lipase. In adults, lingual lipase is much less important than in newborns in whom it contributes to as much as 50 percent of lipid hydrolysis. The lipid emulsion enters the duodenum and is exposed to pancreatic lipase, which enzymatically degrades each triglyceride molecule into a 2-monoglyceride and two fatty acids. Optimizing the activity of pancreatic lipase depends upon the presence of another enzyme, colipase, which appears to anchor lipase to triglyceride droplets and prevent bile salts from deactivating lipase. Free fatty acids released by gastric lipolysis contribute to stimulating the secretion of pancreatic lipase and colipase, and it is these last enzymes that are responsible for the majority of lipid hydrolysis. Two other factors optimize the effect of these pancreatic enzymes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The entry of gastric hydrogen ions into the duodenum stimulates the release of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a>, which enhances pancreatic bicarbonate secretion. This raises the intraluminal pH to approximately 6.5, which is optimal for fat digestion. Diseases that substantially decrease duodenal pH, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, can selectively inhibit fat absorption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bile salts further enhance fat solubilization, producing an emulsion of microscopic micelles consisting predominantly of fatty acids, 2-monoglycerides, cholesterol esters, and some diglycerides coated by phospholipid.</p><p/><p>Dietary and biliary phospholipids and cholesterol are further hydrolyzed by the action of phospholipase A2 and pancreatic cholesterol esterase.</p><p>The resulting mixture is a complex soup of lipolytic products. These products, along with other lipids and fat soluble vitamins, are mixed with bile salts forming small aggregates known as micelles or larger aggregates known as liposomes. In this form, 2-monoglycerides and fatty acids readily enter the unstirred water layer that lies adjacent to the enterocyte and are then absorbed across the apical membrane of the cell. The bile salts themselves remain in the intestinal lumen, eventually reaching the terminal ileum where they are actively resorbed, enter the portal circulation, and are then re-secreted into bile. This cycle is known as the enterohepatic circulation.</p><p>Disease, or resection, of greater than 100 cm of terminal ileum commonly results in severe impairment of the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts such that the liver's ability to upregulate de novo bile acid synthesis is inadequate to meet normal physiological needs for bile production, resulting in fat malabsorption. Similarly, deconjugation of bile acids by florid small bowel bacterial overgrowth defunctionalizes the bile acids, and can also result in fat malabsorption.</p><p>A much milder form of bacterial overgrowth often accompanies atrophic gastritis or the use of proton pump inhibitory (PPI) drugs, but this condition does not typically result in fat malabsorption. However, sustained administration of PPIs does interfere with the absorption of vitamin B12, sometimes to a degree sufficient to generate a clinically-significant deficiency syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-nutrient-absorption-and-malabsorption/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proton-pump-inhibitors-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-acid-related-disorders#H59976227\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proton pump inhibitors: Overview of use and adverse effects in the treatment of acid related disorders&quot;, section on 'Vitamin B12 malabsorption'</a>.)</p><p>Loss of shorter segments of the terminal ileum may still result in chronic diarrhea even though it may not result in fat malabsorption since the bile acids not absorbed in the small intestine may stimulate water secretion in the colon (which is called 'cholerrheic diarrhea').</p><p>Although the absorption of fatty acids was once believed to occur entirely by passive diffusion, more recent evidence indicates that protein-mediated transport processes also contribute. Three proteins that have been implicated are fatty acid transport protein 4 (FATP4), CD36, and caveolin-1. The precise roles played by each of these proteins have yet to be understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-nutrient-absorption-and-malabsorption/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. Further characterization of the roles played by these three proteins may produce novel drugs for the treatment of obesity.</p><p>Once within villus absorptive cells, fatty acids are transported intracellularly to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum where triglycerides are resynthesized. Triglycerides, cholesterol esters, phospholipid, and apoproteins form an aggregate known as a chylomicron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-nutrient-absorption-and-malabsorption/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], which binds to the basolateral membrane and is transported to the intestinal lymphatics to enter the general circulation.</p><p>Disturbances in any of the above mentioned steps in fat assimilation can lead to fat malabsorption and steatorrhea. These include impaired production or activity of pancreatic lipase or colipase, disorders of bile acid metabolism, a decrease in the absorptive surface area, defective apoproteins necessary for the packaging of chylomicrons, or abnormalities in lymphatic flow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CARBOHYDRATE ABSORPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Starch, sucrose, and lactose are the most abundant digestible carbohydrates in the human diet. Dietary starch and disaccharides must be broken down into their constituent monosaccharides prior to absorption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70035\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70035 \">figure 1</a>). Some plant polysaccharides, such as cellulose, cannot be digested in the small intestinal lumen, although they are fermented to a degree in the colon.</p><p>Dietary starch consists of the two principal polysaccharides: amylose and amylopectin. Both salivary and pancreatic amylase contribute to their digestion. The products of digestion by amylase are oligo- and disaccharides that are then further degraded at the level of the microvillus membrane. At this site, brush border enzymes (primarily disaccharidases) hydrolyze both digested and ingested oligo- and disaccharides into monosaccharides, which can be absorbed by either active or passive transport processes.</p><p>Impaired absorption of carbohydrates may result from a deficiency in pancreatic amylase, reduced disaccharidase activity in the small intestinal epithelium, or decreased absorptive intestinal surface area. In primary carbohydrate malabsorption, single functional elements of carbohydrate digestion or absorption are missing, such as in congenital lactase deficiency and sucrase-isomaltase deficiency. Secondary carbohydrate malabsorption can occur from diseases leading to a reduced intestinal absorptive area, such as celiac disease.</p><p>Carbohydrates that are not digested and absorbed in the small intestine undergo bacterial degradation in the colon. The terminal phase of bacterial carbohydrate degradation is fermentation, which results in the formation of short-chain fatty acids (butyrate, propionate, acetate, lactate), as well as carbon dioxide, hydrogen (H2), and methane. Excessive bacterial fermentation is the reason for acidic stools, abdominal distension, and flatulence in patients with carbohydrate malabsorption.</p><p>Short-chain fatty acids are available as an additional energy source as they are efficiently absorbed from the colon, and are a preferred energy source for colonic epithelial cells. This allows the body to recover a portion of the potential energy contained within indigestible food fiber and other undigested carbohydrates.</p><p>The production of hydrogen and methane, resulting from the fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates, and their subsequent excretion through the lungs constitutes the basis of a number of noninvasive breath tests designed to look for malabsorption of particular carbohydrates. The most common of these tests is the lactose breath test, which accurately defines those who are deficient in lactase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-nutrient-absorption-and-malabsorption/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactose-intolerance-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lactose intolerance: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Lactose breath hydrogen test'</a>.)</p><p>With the rising use of fructose as a sweetener in commercially prepared foods, often as high-fructose corn syrup, concern about fructose intolerance has emerged, although the clinical syndrome remains a matter of controversy. Some individuals seem to develop symptoms of carbohydrate malabsorption when sufficiently large quantities of fructose are consumed, particularly if the fructose is in a form other than as one of the monosaccharide components of sucrose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of malabsorption&quot;, section on 'Fructose intolerance'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PROTEIN ABSORPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Protein digestion begins in the stomach by the action of gastric pepsins, which are released as proenzymes (pepsinogen 1 and 2), and undergo autoactivation at low pH. The amount of proteolysis achieved by gastric pepsins depends upon the composition of other dietary constituents, gastric motility, and pH. The observation that patients who are achlorhydric or have lost control of gastric emptying can still digest proteins suggests that proteolysis within the stomach is not essential for protein digestion. However, amino acids released from gastric digestion play a role in releasing cholecystokinin (CCK) from duodenal and jejunal endocrine epithelial cells. CCK is critical for stimulating the release of pancreatic enzymes responsible for nutrient absorption.</p><p>In the duodenum, several proteases act together to digest proteins into amino acids, or dipeptides and tripeptides. Like gastric pepsinogens, pancreatic enzymes are secreted as inactive proenzymes, which are activated by hydrolysis of a peptide bond. Central to this process is enterokinase, which is released from the microvillus membrane of duodenal absorptive cells by the action of bile salts. Enterokinase converts trypsinogen to trypsin, which then catalyzes the conversion of all other pancreatic proteases to their active forms, as well as auto-catalyzing the activation of additional trypsinogen.</p><p>Following pancreatic enzyme digestion, amino acids, dipeptides, and tripeptides can be absorbed through highly efficient sodium-dependent amino acid co-transporters at the brush border membrane; this step is passive but is called secondary active transport since the energy is indirectly provided by the sodium-potassium ATPase pump. By maintaining a low intracellular sodium concentration and a cell interior negative potential, the pump provides a strong inward gradient for sodium entry which can drive the absorption of amino acids.</p><p>Different classes of amino acid transporters exist on the brush border, as evidenced by selectivity expressed for neutral, basic, and acidic amino acids. Transporters for dipeptides and tripeptides are also distinct from those responsible for free amino acid transport. Additional peptidases are located within the brush border membrane and the cytoplasm of absorptive cells.</p><p>Impaired digestion and absorption of dietary protein occurs when pancreatic protease secretion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> activity is impaired, as in chronic pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis. Protein malabsorption can also occur in diseases associated with a generalized reduction of the intestinal absorptive surface. Possible clinical consequences include hypoalbuminemia and protein malnutrition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">VITAMIN, MINERAL, AND TRACE ELEMENT ABSORPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vitamins and minerals represent a wide array of compounds, possessing an equally wide array of biochemical properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-nutrient-absorption-and-malabsorption/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It is therefore not surprising that the intestine has many types of transport mechanisms to facilitate assimilation of these nutrients across the intestinal barrier. Some nutrients, such as the carotenoids, appear to be absorbed solely by passive diffusion, while others are absorbed by carrier-mediated, non-energy requiring processes, and some by active transport systems (ie, energy-requiring transporters that can work against a chemical gradient), such as folate and calcium. The type of transport varies in different portions of the small intestine for many micronutrients.</p><p>A more detailed discussion of the transport mechanisms for each nutrient is beyond the scope of this discussion but a few general remarks can be made that have implications in regard to the clinical management of malabsorption:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) require solubilization in a mixed micellar phase in order to be absorbed. As a result, factors that adversely impact on fat absorption will usually affect absorption of these vitamins in a parallel manner.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The proximal half of the small intestine is the predominant site for the absorption of most vitamins and minerals. A notable exception is vitamin B12, which is absorbed by a specific ileal receptor that recognizes the B12-intrinsic factor complex. Thus, extensive ileal disease or resection decreases B12 absorption and often leads to a deficiency state. As a general rule, ileal disease or resection exceeding 100 cm is associated with a high risk of B12 deficiency. As mentioned above, this degree of ileal impairment is also associated with fat malabsorption and may thereby interfere with assimilation of fat-soluble vitamins. Another exception is magnesium. The mechanism responsible for the intestinal absorption of magnesium remains ill defined, but it occurs avidly in the distal intestine (including the colon). Patients with distal small intestinal and colonic disease are thus particularly susceptible to hypomagnesemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-hypomagnesemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of hypomagnesemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The excess fatty acids present in the intestinal lumen of patients with untreated fat malabsorption bind divalent cations, such as calcium and magnesium, creating soaps and causing undue losses of these minerals. Clinically significant deficiencies of these minerals are common in untreated fat malabsorption and create a substantial risk for metabolic bone disease. The problem of calcium depletion in this setting will be further magnified if vitamin D deficiency is also present. Magnesium is needed for both the secretion and peripheral action of parathyroid hormone. As a result, refractory hypocalcemia in the setting of fat malabsorption occasionally responds to magnesium replacement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypocalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypocalcemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The avidity with which some nutrients are absorbed in the intestine is regulated by the nutritional status of the individual in regard to the specific nutrient. Examples include calcium, for which the upregulation of transport appears to be primarily a vitamin D-mediated process, and inorganic (ie, non-heme) iron absorption, for which systemic iron deficiency causes a remarkable increase in the efficiency of iron absorption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The number of surgeries done to correct obesity continues to rise, underscoring the need to appreciate nutrient deficiencies that commonly accompany the resulting weight loss. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is presently the most common procedure of this type performed in the United States. In addition to discouraging the intake of food, this surgical procedure produces mild malabsorption of a multifactorial nature. Vitamin B12, iron, calcium, and vitamin D deficiencies are the most commonly observed; more rarely ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and copper deficiencies have been described. Routine <span class=\"nowrap\">multivitamin/mineral</span> supplementation is indicated, although it is not sufficient to prevent micronutrient deficiencies in some instances, so ongoing monitoring is indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Late complications of bariatric surgical operations&quot;</a>.) In the weeks to months immediately following such surgery, there have been many reports of thiamin deficiency, with classical symptoms of beriberi, arising in the setting of persistent vomiting and poor food intake. </p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77722886\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malabsorption can result from defects in any of the three phases of nutrient absorption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54743\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54743 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Luminal processing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Absorption into the intestinal mucosa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Transport into the circulation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disturbances in the steps in fat assimilation can lead to fat malabsorption and steatorrhea.
