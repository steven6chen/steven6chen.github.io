It is highly associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), occurring in 50 percent of individuals at some time during the course of their illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Optic neuritis is the presenting feature of MS in 15 to 20 percent of patients.</p><p>The prognosis and treatment of demyelinating optic neuritis will be reviewed in this topic. The epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of optic neuritis are discussed separately.

Improvement can continue over many months; 90 percent have <span class=\"nowrap\">20/40</span> or better vision at one year. Some patients may have a more or less favorable prognosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower visual acuity at the time of presentation is associated with less complete recovery; however, even those who have no light perception at presentation can recover normal vision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT), 64 percent of patients whose vision at presentation was no better than light perception achieved a final visual acuity of <span class=\"nowrap\">20/40</span> or better [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Severe vision loss at one month, however, is less likely to be associated with good visual recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Longer lesions in the optic nerve, as demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly those extending into the optic canal, are associated with poorer visual outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. A number of studies have found that reduced axial diffusivity on diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) correlates with prolonged latency of visual evoked potentials and worse visual outcome on follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>African American patients have a worse prognosis for visual recovery in comparison with Caucasian Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Data on 86 patients from one center found that African American patients had more severe visual loss both at presentation (worse than <span class=\"nowrap\">20/200</span> in 93 versus 39 percent) and at one year (worse than <span class=\"nowrap\">20/200</span> in 17 versus 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. At one year, only 61 percent of African Americans had better than <span class=\"nowrap\">20/40</span> acuity compared with 92 percent of Caucasians.

In one series, patients with aquaporin-4-specific serum antibodies were found to have poorer visual outcomes than those with seronegative findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p>Visual recovery is typically measured by acuity. However, one study found that patients with recovery of full visual acuity after optic neuritis may have persistent deficits in tasks that require visual motion perception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the ONTT, there was a 35 percent recurrence of optic neuritis at 10 years: 14 percent in the original eye, 12 percent in the other eye, and 9 percent in both eyes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Individuals with recurrent optic neuritis have a greater risk of developing MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/22,28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,28-31</a>]. Recurrent optic neuritis in combination with seropositivity for the aquaporin-4-specific serum autoantibody was predictive of subsequent neuromyelitis optica (NMO) in a number of studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32</a>]. Patients with recurrent optic neuritis that is not associated with MS or NMO should be investigated for other causes.

The cumulative incidence increased to 40 percent at 12 years and 50 percent at 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/28,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,34</a>]. The median time to diagnosis of MS was three years. Other series have reported similar results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/29,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,35,36</a>].</p><p>Demographic characteristics associated with risk of MS include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age. In many series, the risk of MS appears to be lower if the initial attack of optic neuritis occurs in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>]. In one investigation, MS occurred in 13 percent of 94 children at 10 years and in 19 percent at 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, in two other case series, the cumulative two-year risk of MS in children with optic neuritis was much higher, 36 to 45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/24,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,37</a>].<br/><br/>Among adults, patients who present with optic neuritis at an older age (greater than 35 to 40 years) may be somewhat less likely to develop MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/29,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,38,39</a>]. Optic neuritis itself is relatively uncommon in individuals over 40 years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=optic-neuritis-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Optic neuritis: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gender. Women may be somewhat more likely to develop MS after optic neuritis than men. In one prospective investigation of patients with optic neuritis followed for 15 years, MS developed in 74 percent of women and 34 percent of men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. A higher risk in women was also reported by the Optic Neuritis Study Group and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/28,29,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29,34</a>]. Others have not found that gender influences MS risk in multivariate analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ethnic and regional influences. In the United States, Asians appear to be less likely to develop MS after optic neuritis than are Caucasians. In one case series, African Americans appeared to be particularly susceptible to the neuromyelitis optica (Devic's disease) form of multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].<br/><br/>The lower incidence rates of MS after optic neuritis in Mexican and South American populations are consistent with the regional variation seen in MS overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. Similarly, the reported risks are also lower in Asian countries, while in Australia and Western Europe, incidence rates are similar to those reported in the ONTT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/29,39,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,39,44,45</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-multiple-sclerosis#H548438808\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and epidemiology of multiple sclerosis&quot;, section on 'Geographic factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Clinical and laboratory features at the time of presentation with optic neuritis are also helpful in determining prognosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRI abnormalities. The presence of characteristic demyelinating lesions on MRI is a strong predictor of developing MS. In the ONTT, the risk of MS after 15 years was 72 percent among those with one or more lesions on MRI versus 25 percent among those with no lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/28,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,34</a>]. The risk did not significantly differ between those with single versus multiple lesions. Other studies report similar results, including two in pediatric populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/24,38,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,38,46,47</a>]<br/><br/>In the ONTT, an abnormal brain MRI dominated other clinical and demographic risk factors, which were useful in prognosis only among those with a normal brain MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. No patient developed MS after 10 years of follow-up if they had no white matter lesions on brain MRI along with any one of the following clinical features considered atypical for optic neuritis: no pain, no light perception vision at presentation, severe disc swelling, peripapillary hemorrhage, or retinal exudates.<br/><br/>MRI findings also predict future MS-related disability. In one prospective series of 106 patients with optic neuritis, the presence of baseline gadolinium-enhancing lesions, and the presence and number of infratentorial and spinal cord lesions were predictive of disability among those who developed MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent episode of optic neuritis. Recurrent optic neuritis is more common among those destined to develop MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/28,29,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29,35</a>]. Patients with recurrent optic neuritis may be particularly at risk for NMO or Devic's disease. This is particularly true for patients with a normal brain MRI and those with optic neuritis events in rapid succession, as well as those with seropositivity for the aquaporin-4-specific serum autoantibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/30,32,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32,48</a>].<br/><br/>In contrast, simultaneous bilateral involvement of the optic nerves at the initial presentation is associated with a lower risk of MS in most but not all studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/22,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Funduscopic examination &mdash; The presence of papillitis, especially if it is severe, is associated with a lower risk of MS, particularly among those with normal brain MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/28,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,34</a>]. Retinal perivenous sheathing is not a common finding in optic neuritis but when present does suggest a higher risk of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebrospinal fluid &mdash; Studies have had somewhat conflicting results regarding the association between abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings (eg, oligoclonal bands [OCB], pleocytosis, myelin basic protein, IgG synthesis) and subsequent risk of MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/29,38,46,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,38,46,49,50</a>]. Most studies find that individuals who have OCB in the CSF at the time of the optic neuritis event are at higher risk of developing MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/29,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,38</a>]. However, OCB are also associated with the presence of white matter lesions on MRI and may not represent an independent risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/49-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-54</a>]. The combination of a normal brain MRI and absent OCB identifies individuals at very low risk of MS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human leukocyte antigen &mdash; The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type has been reported to affect the relationship between optic neuritis and MS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. One prospective study of patients with optic neuritis found a higher risk for conversion to MS among those with HLA-DR2 alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Some investigations have corroborated this association, but others have not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/29,38,55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,38,55,56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum antibodies &mdash; Investigators have sought a specific serum marker for multiple sclerosis. In one case series of 103 individuals with clinically isolated syndromes (40 were optic neuritis), seropositivity for antibodies against myelin basic protein and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein identified patients at high risk for MS in adjusted multivariate analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, a subsequent study did not find this association in a patient population with optic neuritis only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. <br/><br/>As discussed above, seropositivity for aquaporin-4-specific serum antibody in patients with recurrent episodes of optic neuritis identifies patients at risk for NMO.

At 10 years, the risk of recurrent optic neuritis remained higher in the oral prednisone group when compared with the intravenous-treated group (44 versus 29 percent), but there was no longer a significant difference between the oral prednisone and placebo groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/7,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,28</a>].</p><p/><p>A small randomized trial found that oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> 500 mg for five days had a beneficial effect on visual function at one and three weeks compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

We use intravenous corticosteroid treatment in patients with abnormal white matter lesions on their brain MRI, since this treatment may delay the onset of MS. We also use intravenous corticosteroid therapy in those patients with either severe or bilateral vision loss, as this may hasten the speed of visual recovery. In the rare circumstance when intravenous corticosteroids are not available, we suggest the administration of high-dose oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The observed risks associated with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> were seen in just one trial, were unexpected, and their pathologic basis is not understood. However, we do not use oral prednisone for treatment of optic neuritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Other acute immunomodulatory therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alternative treatments used for acute neuroimmunologic disease include intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) and plasma exchange. These do not have established efficacy in the treatment of optic neuritis.</p><p>Two randomized trials studied the potential benefit of IVIG in 55 and 68 patients with optic neuritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. Neither study found a difference in visual outcomes at six months. MRI outcomes and the incidence of subsequent demyelinating events at six months were also similar between treatment groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Another report of IVIG treatment in 23 patients with corticosteroid refractory optic neuritis found that 78 percent achieved vision <span class=\"nowrap\">20/30</span> or better, compared with 12.5 percent in a nonrandomized, matched control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The benefit appeared sustained at one year.</p><p>Ten patients with severe optic neuritis underwent plasma exchange between 11 to 73 days after presentation and after failing to respond to intravenous corticosteroid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Seven patients appeared to respond with improvements in visual acuity; however, improvement was not sustained in two of these.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic immunomodulatory therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We offer treatment with immunomodulatory therapies to patients with optic neuritis and abnormal brain MRIs. Such patients are considered to have a clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of multiple sclerosis. If such patients can tolerate treatment, potential benefits as demonstrated by randomized clinical trials include a longer attack-free interval, reduced number of demyelinating attacks, and a delay to MS-associated disability. The management of patients with clinically isolated syndromes is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinically-isolated-syndromes-suggestive-of-multiple-sclerosis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment in children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All of the clinical trials of treatment discussed above were limited to adults. No clinical trial data are available to guide the treatment of children with optic neuritis. Given their lower risk of MS, some modifications in the treatment approach seem reasonable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> can be considered for acute treatment for severe debilitating bilateral vision loss in hopes of hastening recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/1,67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,67,68</a>]. The risk of short-term treatment is low in children. While some clinicians recommend a longer taper rate (four to eight weeks) than is used in adults because of anecdotal reports of relapses of vision loss occurring with a shorter taper in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>], this practice did not appear to lead to improved relapse rates according to one retrospective cohort study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. As with adults, case series suggest that the final visual outcome is not altered by this treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optic-neuritis-prognosis-and-treatment/abstract/19,20,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20,69</a>]. </p><p>The evaluation and use of chronic immunomodulatory therapy in children who present with clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis is discussed separately.
