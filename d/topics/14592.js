PTSD is seen in some children (and not others) after exposure to traumatic experiences involving actual or threatened injury to themselves or others. </p><p>PTSD is characterized by intrusive thoughts and reminders of the traumatic experience(s), avoidance of trauma reminders, negative mood and cognitions related to the traumatic experience(s), and physiological hyperarousal that lead to significant social, school, and interpersonal problems. PTSD can occur even in toddlers (one to two years old) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>This topic will address psychosocial treatment of PTSD in children, including early intervention to prevent the development of PTSD. Pharmacotherapy for PTSD in children is reviewed separately. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of PTSD in children are also addressed separately, as are acute stress disorder, PTSD, and dissociative PTSD in adults.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-treating-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to treating posttraumatic stress disorder in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H407869\"><span class=\"h1\">TRAUMA-FOCUSED PSYCHOTHERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several trauma-focused psychotherapies have been found to be efficacious in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or subthreshold PTSD symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. These interventions include individual and group models, as well as models tailored to meet the needs of specific subgroups. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32911407\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PTSD is conceptualized as a disorder of fear conditioning that is both overgeneralized and fails to extinguish normally. Biological, learning, and <span class=\"nowrap\">social/environmental</span> factors are implicated in the development and maintenance of child PTSD, suggesting the need for nuanced approaches to treatment.</p><p>Trauma elicits strong emotional responses (eg, fear, anger). Through operant conditioning, children associate other stimuli (eg, people, places, smells, or internal feelings) that were present at the time of the trauma (&quot;trauma reminders&quot;) with those highly negative emotional responses. In an attempt to avoid these negative emotions, children avoid these trauma reminders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H423111237\"><span class=\"h2\">Individual trauma-focused CBT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) for children and adolescents with PTSD is a parallel child and parent (or primary caregiver) treatment model that incorporates cognitive-behavioral, developmental, neurobiological, attachment, family, and empowerment principles. Goals include helping children and parents gain resiliency and coping skills, master learned and over-generalized avoidance of feared trauma memories, make more adaptive meaning of traumatic experiences, and resume optimal developmental trajectories. The efficacy of TF-CBT is described below. (See <a href=\"#H373053382\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>Children with trauma-related symptoms can benefit from trauma-focused psychotherapy whether or not they meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H423111259\"><span class=\"h3\">Phases and components</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TF-CBT is comprised of multiple components and is provided in three phases. Within each treatment session, therapy is provided in individual, parallel sessions to the child and the parent (or caregiver, hereafter &quot;parent&quot;), and in conjoint child-parent sessions as described below. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stabilization phase</strong> &ndash; Includes psychoeducation, parenting skills, relaxation skills, affect modulation skills, and cognitive processing skills. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trauma narration and processing phase</strong> &ndash; Includes trauma narration and processing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Integration and consolidation</strong> <strong>phase &ndash;</strong> Includes in vivo mastery, conjoint child-parent sessions, and enhancing safety. </p><p/><p>The components of these phases, which spell out the acronym &quot;PPRACTICE,&quot; are briefly described below: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychoeducation</strong> &ndash; Information is provided about the connection between the child&rsquo;s past (or ongoing) trauma experiences, trauma reminders, and the child&rsquo;s presenting trauma symptoms, as well as information about the commonality of these responses following trauma. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Parenting skills</strong> &ndash; Effective parenting strategies are provided and practiced with the parent. These include skills such as praise, selective attention, and using functional behavioral analysis (eg, changing antecedents and consequences) to effectively manage behavioral trauma impact. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Relaxation skills</strong> &ndash; Relaxation strategies (eg, focused breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, exercise, visualization) are provided, individualized, and practiced to reverse physiological trauma impact, including in response to trauma reminders. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Affect modulation skills</strong> &ndash; Feeling identification and modulation skills (eg, verbal expression of negative feelings, seeking social support, positive distraction strategies, problem solving) are provided, individualized, and practiced, including in response to trauma reminders. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cognitive processing skills</strong> &ndash; Identifying relationships among general negative thought patterns (eg, &quot;I don&rsquo;t have any friends&quot;), negative feelings (eg, angry), and behaviors (eg, fighting with peers), and learning to generate more accurate or helpful thoughts (eg, &quot;Jesse likes me&quot;) in order to feel better (eg, less mad) and behave differently (eg, ask Jesse to play at recess). These skills help children and parents to gain mastery over many negative feelings and behaviors and prepare them for more specific trauma-related cognitive processing in the next phase. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trauma narration and processing</strong> &ndash; During this phase, the therapist helps the child to develop a detailed narrative of his or her personal trauma experiences and to cognitively process these experiences using the skills described above. This component is an interactive, therapeutic process that occurs between the therapist and child (and between the therapist and parent, as the therapist shares the content of the child&rsquo;s narrative with the parent). It is believed that PTSD symptoms (eg, avoidance, negative cognitions, negative feelings, and negative behaviors) are diminished through expressing trauma-related information and addressing maladaptive cognitions related to this material. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>In vivo mastery of trauma reminders</strong> &ndash; For children who have over-generalized fear of trauma-related stimuli in the environment (eg, avoid the bathroom or bedroom where past abuse occurred but that is now safe; avoid attending school where they were previously bullied but are now safe), in vivo exposure is used to gain adaptive functioning. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Conjoint child-parent sessions</strong> &ndash; One or more conjoint child-parent sessions are included to enhance direct child-parent communication about trauma (eg, sharing the child&rsquo;s trauma narrative directly with the parent, safety planning, and other individualized issues).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Enhancing safety</strong> &ndash; Trauma entails disruption of safety; reconstituting the child&rsquo;s actual and sense of safety is critical for recovery. Safety skills appropriate to the child&rsquo;s developmental level and living circumstances are provided and practiced with child and parent. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H373053382\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple randomized clinical trials have compared TF-CBT with active treatments or controls for PTSD in children, collectively finding that TF-CBT reduced PTSD symptoms compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6-13</a>]. Findings for improvement in associated symptoms (ie, depression, anxiety, behavior problems, maladaptive cognitions, and parental difficulties) have shown some variation but have been mostly positive. A meta-analysis of three trials with a total of 98 youth with PTSD reported that CBT led to reduced PTSD symptoms one month after treatment compared with controls (standard mean difference = -1.34, 95% CI -1.79 to -0.89) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Clinical trials have shown efficacy for children exposed to sexual abuse, domestic violence, war, and multiple or complex trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-13</a>]. &#160;</p><p>As an example, the largest randomized trial was a multi-site trial of 220 children (ages 8 to 14 years) with symptoms in each cluster of DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for PTSD, and a history of multiple traumas (mean = 3.4) including an index trauma of validated sexual abuse. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 12 sessions of TF-CBT or Child Centered Therapy (CCT), both provided weekly to child and parent. At the end of treatment, the TF-CBT group experienced reductions in PTSD symptoms and in the proportion meeting diagnostic criteria for PTSD, compared with the CCT group; effect sizes were medium to large [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111055915\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TF-CBT is typically provided to individual children once weekly during hourly sessions for a duration of 12 to 25 sessions. The duration of treatment and proportionality among its phases are influenced by the child&rsquo;s clinical presentation, with children who have more typical PTSD receiving a shorter duration (12 to 16 sessions), and children who have more complex PTSD receiving a longer duration (16 to 25 sessions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Clinicians typically monitor children&rsquo;s responses to treatment through child self-reported ratings of PTSD symptom severity. This is best accomplished in clinical practice using a self-report instrument such as the <a href=\"http://www.aacap.org/App_Themes/AACAP/docs/resource_centers/resources/misc/child_ptsd_symptom_scale.pdf&amp;token=tjCtkzt1Q3VPCGUL0aGUtJBgbppCUFpan0oRshuy3YsDRkkDppYbXd7ILA5FUplGls6YlZTs3g91uK2aGcI/Xca7VieCvJ5bASRcDWYkvNumAOnneXcsqa9oVIS5S3RF&amp;TOPIC_ID=99647\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Child PTSD Symptom Scale</a> or, for young children, the parent reported instrument <a href=\"http://www.infantinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/YCPC_v5_23_14.pdf&amp;token=zo2wjcUklAr6TufBtRvTgJBgSOwevNFCAyWM9Z9JTN4BZc84yvDsVWfnIbYKLzagV2nOkJQnxqOBdjbMsJDovOsJTk0HwDd3FWRrtbAwAemvALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=99647\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Young Children&rsquo;s PTSD Checklist</a>. &#160; </p><p>Individual TF-CBT has been modified to treat groups of children with PTSD and to treat preschool-aged children.

Complex trauma, which is not in DSM-5 but is proposed for inclusion in the International Classification of Diseases, differs from non-complex PTSD in the subject&rsquo;s history of chronic trauma and, in addition to core PTSD features, the presence of prominent features of affective dysregulation, negative self-concept, and interpersonal disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

In one randomized trial, 126 sixth-grade students who reported exposure to violence and had PTSD symptoms were randomized to receive a 10-session CBITS group treatment or to a wait list control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. After three months, CBITS students had significantly greater improvement in PTSD symptoms than those assigned to the wait list condition; after treatment, the CBITS group mean scores were in the nonclinical range, whereas mean scores for the wait list group remained in the clinical range (large effect size). Significantly lower scores in the intervention group were also seen for depression and psychosocial dysfunction. Similar results were obtained in the quasi-randomized studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>Clinician training via a free CBITS online course is available from the CBITS developers at <a href=\"http://cbitsprogram.org/&amp;token=jP28doNMU99AANigj1IVQ/9jl1iRZm8l0D4DPwkT3E+vALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=99647\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://cbitsprogram.org</a>.

Training in the CBITS model includes face-to-face training, phone consultation, or participation in a CBITS learning collaborative. </p><p>CBITS has been widely disseminated to schools in the United States and internationally, but many schools do not have CBITS therapists available. This has led to the development of a variant of CBITS, Supporting Students Exposed to Trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], which can be provided by educators, and thus could be disseminated more easily. Preliminary study suggests that implementation of this approach is feasible and acceptable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]; further study of its efficacy is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H401180196\"><span class=\"h3\">Trauma grief components treatment (TGCT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TGCT differs from other group CBT interventions in that it is somewhat longer (17 sessions) and includes both trauma-focused and grief-focused treatment components that aim to address PTSD and maladaptive grief responses, respectively. TGCT is particularly appropriate for teens who have PTSD symptoms and maladaptive grief related to war, terrorism, or other circumstances of traumatic death. </p><p>A clinical trial in 127 war-exposed Bosnian adolescents with symptoms of PTSD, depression, or maladaptive grief found that school-based TGCT was superior to a school-based psychoeducation and skills comparison condition for improving PTSD and maladaptive grief responses with medium to large effect sizes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2436624498\"><span class=\"h3\">ERASE-Stress</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extending and enhancing resiliency amongst students experiencing (ERASE)-Stress is a 16-session, teacher-delivered resiliency-building intervention designed specifically for children and adolescents who have been exposed to terrorism or war. While CBITS is a clinician-delivered intervention provided to children with trauma-related symptoms, ERASE-Stress is provided by teachers to all exposed children, either to prevent the emergence of symptoms or as treatment of symptoms when present. &#160;</p><p>Two quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing ERASE-Stress with wait list control conditions for 142 children and 154 adolescents in Israel, respectively, found that children assigned to receive ERASE-Stress experienced greater improvement in PTSD symptoms (medium effect sizes), as well as in somatic complaints and anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

Both trials found that TF-CBT, compared with the control conditions, resulted in greater improvement in symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety, as well as in conduct and pro-social behaviors (large effect sizes for each result) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113157199\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapies for preschool children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DSM-5 describes developmental differences in how PTSD is manifested in young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Typical PTSD symptoms are manifestations of young children&rsquo;s basic fears (eg, body damage, abandonment, loss of caregiver). With limited verbal and cognitive abilities, young children are particularly dependent on and trusting of caregivers to provide safety. When trauma occurs, this safety and trust is disrupted. </p><p>Effective trauma treatments for young children must rebuild the young child&rsquo;s trust that the caregiver will keep the child safe and the caregiver&rsquo;s ability to do so. This has been accomplished through attachment-based models that primarily focus on the child-parent relationship and by CBT models that focus on enhancing child-parent resiliency skills, communication, positive parenting, and the caregiver&rsquo;s ability to promote safety. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H758923\"><span class=\"h3\">Child-Parent Psychotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP), developed for young children (birth to six years) who have experienced a trauma and their parent(s) or caretaking adult, is a dyadic attachment-based psychotherapy focused on supporting and strengthening the parent-child relationship as a way to heal the negative impacts of interpersonal trauma. Although CPP has some CBT elements, it is primarily based on attachment and psychodynamic theory. CPP is particularly valuable for very young children (birth to three years) and other young children (eg, those with developmental delays) who cannot express their emotions verbally but do so through play; the CPP therapist helps the parent to understand and make more benign meaning of the child&rsquo;s play, behaviors, and interactions with the parent. </p><p>As a longer-term treatment approach (one year), CPP provides more sustained interventions to the child and parent and thus may be particularly helpful for parents who are highly dysregulated due to personal experiences of domestic violence. Targets of intervention include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Addressing parental and child maladaptive representations of self and each other</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Developing a joint trauma narrative to identify and address trauma triggers</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Developing more satisfying interpersonal relationships, activities, routines, and goals </p><p/><p>A randomized trial compared CPP with case management and community treatment referral for 75 preschool children with PTSD stemming from domestic violence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. After one year of weekly sessions monitored for fidelity, children receiving CPP experienced greater improvement in PTSD symptoms (medium effect size), as well as for total behavior problems (small effect size), relative to children receiving the comparison condition. Mothers receiving CPP also exhibited significantly greater decrease in avoidance symptoms and a trend toward reduction in their own personal PTSD symptoms. </p><p>CPP is provided in 40 to 50 weekly dyadic child-parent sessions with additional parent sessions provided as needed. Clinicians typically monitor young children&rsquo;s PTSD and behavioral symptoms systematically; a developmentally appropriate instrument should be used, such as the <a href=\"http://www.infantinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/YCPC_v5_23_14.pdf&amp;token=zo2wjcUklAr6TufBtRvTgJBgSOwevNFCAyWM9Z9JTN4BZc84yvDsVWfnIbYKLzagV2nOkJQnxqOBdjbMsJDovOsJTk0HwDd3FWRrtbAwAemvALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=99647\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">YCPC</a> described above.

Two clinical trials have examined preschool children&rsquo;s response to TF-CBT. A clinical trial compared TF-CBT with nondirective supportive therapy (NST) in 86 children ages three to six years with at least five PTSD symptoms following an index trauma of sexual abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Children assigned to all four TF-CBT conditions showed improvement in PTSD symptoms with large effect sizes. Children assigned to the eight-session group with a trauma narrative phase showed greater improvement than other groups in internalizing symptoms of fear and anxiety, while children assigned to receive 16 sessions without the trauma narrative phase showed greater improvement in externalizing behavior symptoms.

PTSD is seen in some children (and not others) after exposure to traumatic experiences involving actual or threatened injury to themselves or others. </p><p>PTSD is characterized by intrusive thoughts and reminders of the traumatic experience(s), avoidance of trauma reminders, negative mood and cognitions related to the traumatic experience(s), and physiological hyperarousal that lead to significant social, school, and interpersonal problems. PTSD can occur even in toddlers (one to two years old) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>This topic will address psychosocial treatment of PTSD in children, including early intervention to prevent the development of PTSD. Pharmacotherapy for PTSD in children is reviewed separately. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of PTSD in children are also addressed separately, as are acute stress disorder, PTSD, and dissociative PTSD in adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posttraumatic stress disorder in children and adolescents: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posttraumatic stress disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-stress-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute stress disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dissociative-aspects-of-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dissociative aspects of posttraumatic stress disorder: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H384457857\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to treating posttraumatic stress disorder in children, including selecting among psychotherapies and medications, is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-treating-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to treating posttraumatic stress disorder in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H407869\"><span class=\"h1\">TRAUMA-FOCUSED PSYCHOTHERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several trauma-focused psychotherapies have been found to be efficacious in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or subthreshold PTSD symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. These interventions include individual and group models, as well as models tailored to meet the needs of specific subgroups. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32911407\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PTSD is conceptualized as a disorder of fear conditioning that is both overgeneralized and fails to extinguish normally. Biological, learning, and <span class=\"nowrap\">social/environmental</span> factors are implicated in the development and maintenance of child PTSD, suggesting the need for nuanced approaches to treatment.</p><p>Trauma elicits strong emotional responses (eg, fear, anger). Through operant conditioning, children associate other stimuli (eg, people, places, smells, or internal feelings) that were present at the time of the trauma (&quot;trauma reminders&quot;) with those highly negative emotional responses. In an attempt to avoid these negative emotions, children avoid these trauma reminders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H423111237\"><span class=\"h2\">Individual trauma-focused CBT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) for children and adolescents with PTSD is a parallel child and parent (or primary caregiver) treatment model that incorporates cognitive-behavioral, developmental, neurobiological, attachment, family, and empowerment principles. Goals include helping children and parents gain resiliency and coping skills, master learned and over-generalized avoidance of feared trauma memories, make more adaptive meaning of traumatic experiences, and resume optimal developmental trajectories. The efficacy of TF-CBT is described below. (See <a href=\"#H373053382\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>Children with trauma-related symptoms can benefit from trauma-focused psychotherapy whether or not they meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H423111259\"><span class=\"h3\">Phases and components</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TF-CBT is comprised of multiple components and is provided in three phases. Within each treatment session, therapy is provided in individual, parallel sessions to the child and the parent (or caregiver, hereafter &quot;parent&quot;), and in conjoint child-parent sessions as described below. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stabilization phase</strong> &ndash; Includes psychoeducation, parenting skills, relaxation skills, affect modulation skills, and cognitive processing skills. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trauma narration and processing phase</strong> &ndash; Includes trauma narration and processing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Integration and consolidation</strong> <strong>phase &ndash;</strong> Includes in vivo mastery, conjoint child-parent sessions, and enhancing safety. </p><p/><p>The components of these phases, which spell out the acronym &quot;PPRACTICE,&quot; are briefly described below: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychoeducation</strong> &ndash; Information is provided about the connection between the child&rsquo;s past (or ongoing) trauma experiences, trauma reminders, and the child&rsquo;s presenting trauma symptoms, as well as information about the commonality of these responses following trauma. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Parenting skills</strong> &ndash; Effective parenting strategies are provided and practiced with the parent. These include skills such as praise, selective attention, and using functional behavioral analysis (eg, changing antecedents and consequences) to effectively manage behavioral trauma impact. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Relaxation skills</strong> &ndash; Relaxation strategies (eg, focused breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, exercise, visualization) are provided, individualized, and practiced to reverse physiological trauma impact, including in response to trauma reminders. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Affect modulation skills</strong> &ndash; Feeling identification and modulation skills (eg, verbal expression of negative feelings, seeking social support, positive distraction strategies, problem solving) are provided, individualized, and practiced, including in response to trauma reminders. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cognitive processing skills</strong> &ndash; Identifying relationships among general negative thought patterns (eg, &quot;I don&rsquo;t have any friends&quot;), negative feelings (eg, angry), and behaviors (eg, fighting with peers), and learning to generate more accurate or helpful thoughts (eg, &quot;Jesse likes me&quot;) in order to feel better (eg, less mad) and behave differently (eg, ask Jesse to play at recess). These skills help children and parents to gain mastery over many negative feelings and behaviors and prepare them for more specific trauma-related cognitive processing in the next phase. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trauma narration and processing</strong> &ndash; During this phase, the therapist helps the child to develop a detailed narrative of his or her personal trauma experiences and to cognitively process these experiences using the skills described above. This component is an interactive, therapeutic process that occurs between the therapist and child (and between the therapist and parent, as the therapist shares the content of the child&rsquo;s narrative with the parent). It is believed that PTSD symptoms (eg, avoidance, negative cognitions, negative feelings, and negative behaviors) are diminished through expressing trauma-related information and addressing maladaptive cognitions related to this material. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>In vivo mastery of trauma reminders</strong> &ndash; For children who have over-generalized fear of trauma-related stimuli in the environment (eg, avoid the bathroom or bedroom where past abuse occurred but that is now safe; avoid attending school where they were previously bullied but are now safe), in vivo exposure is used to gain adaptive functioning. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Conjoint child-parent sessions</strong> &ndash; One or more conjoint child-parent sessions are included to enhance direct child-parent communication about trauma (eg, sharing the child&rsquo;s trauma narrative directly with the parent, safety planning, and other individualized issues).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Enhancing safety</strong> &ndash; Trauma entails disruption of safety; reconstituting the child&rsquo;s actual and sense of safety is critical for recovery. Safety skills appropriate to the child&rsquo;s developmental level and living circumstances are provided and practiced with child and parent. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H373053382\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple randomized clinical trials have compared TF-CBT with active treatments or controls for PTSD in children, collectively finding that TF-CBT reduced PTSD symptoms compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6-13</a>]. Findings for improvement in associated symptoms (ie, depression, anxiety, behavior problems, maladaptive cognitions, and parental difficulties) have shown some variation but have been mostly positive. A meta-analysis of three trials with a total of 98 youth with PTSD reported that CBT led to reduced PTSD symptoms one month after treatment compared with controls (standard mean difference = -1.34, 95% CI -1.79 to -0.89) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Clinical trials have shown efficacy for children exposed to sexual abuse, domestic violence, war, and multiple or complex trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-13</a>]. &#160;</p><p>As an example, the largest randomized trial was a multi-site trial of 220 children (ages 8 to 14 years) with symptoms in each cluster of DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for PTSD, and a history of multiple traumas (mean = 3.4) including an index trauma of validated sexual abuse. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 12 sessions of TF-CBT or Child Centered Therapy (CCT), both provided weekly to child and parent. At the end of treatment, the TF-CBT group experienced reductions in PTSD symptoms and in the proportion meeting diagnostic criteria for PTSD, compared with the CCT group; effect sizes were medium to large [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111055915\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TF-CBT is typically provided to individual children once weekly during hourly sessions for a duration of 12 to 25 sessions. The duration of treatment and proportionality among its phases are influenced by the child&rsquo;s clinical presentation, with children who have more typical PTSD receiving a shorter duration (12 to 16 sessions), and children who have more complex PTSD receiving a longer duration (16 to 25 sessions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Clinicians typically monitor children&rsquo;s responses to treatment through child self-reported ratings of PTSD symptom severity. This is best accomplished in clinical practice using a self-report instrument such as the <a href=\"http://www.aacap.org/App_Themes/AACAP/docs/resource_centers/resources/misc/child_ptsd_symptom_scale.pdf&amp;token=tjCtkzt1Q3VPCGUL0aGUtJBgbppCUFpan0oRshuy3YsDRkkDppYbXd7ILA5FUplGls6YlZTs3g91uK2aGcI/Xca7VieCvJ5bASRcDWYkvNumAOnneXcsqa9oVIS5S3RF&amp;TOPIC_ID=99647\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Child PTSD Symptom Scale</a> or, for young children, the parent reported instrument <a href=\"http://www.infantinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/YCPC_v5_23_14.pdf&amp;token=zo2wjcUklAr6TufBtRvTgJBgSOwevNFCAyWM9Z9JTN4BZc84yvDsVWfnIbYKLzagV2nOkJQnxqOBdjbMsJDovOsJTk0HwDd3FWRrtbAwAemvALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=99647\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Young Children&rsquo;s PTSD Checklist</a>. &#160; </p><p>Individual TF-CBT has been modified to treat groups of children with PTSD and to treat preschool-aged children.

CBITS incorporates cognitive behavioral principles with peer support and resiliency modeling to help children overcome learned trauma avoidance and gain adaptive skills. School-based group treatment greatly expands access to mental health services.</p><p>CBITS has been developed for schoolchildren ages 10 to 15 years who have one or more disclosed traumas and PTSD or significant PTSD symptoms. Evaluation of CBITS for primary school children is underway. Students are typically identified for inclusion in CBITS based on school screening using a PTSD self-report instrument, such as the <a href=\"http://www.aacap.org/App_Themes/AACAP/docs/resource_centers/resources/misc/child_ptsd_symptom_scale.pdf&amp;token=tjCtkzt1Q3VPCGUL0aGUtJBgbppCUFpan0oRshuy3YsDRkkDppYbXd7ILA5FUplGls6YlZTs3g91uK2aGcI/Xca7VieCvJ5bASRcDWYkvNumAOnneXcsqa9oVIS5S3RF&amp;TOPIC_ID=99647\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Child PTSD Symptom Scale</a>. &#160;</p><p>A primary trauma of child abuse or domestic violence may be a contraindication for CBITS participation in some schools, since some administrators <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> parents believe that these issues should not be addressed in the school setting.</p><p>CBITS treatment is provided over the course of 10 school-based group sessions. Groups of six to eight children meet for approximately one hour during school for weekly sessions. The contents of CBITS include the same components as TF-CBT. Children develop personal trauma narratives during two additional individual &quot;break out&quot; sessions that occur separately from the group sessions. Parents of each child are offered the opportunity to take part in parallel parent groups. Teachers receive education about trauma impact and management of trauma symptoms in educational settings. PTSD and depressive symptoms are typically monitored at pre- and posttreatment for improvement using self-report instruments.</p><p>CBITS has been shown to be efficacious when delivered by trained school-based mental health clinicians in one large clinical trial and two quasi-randomized studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,28,29</a>].

After three months, CBITS students had significantly greater improvement in PTSD symptoms than those assigned to the wait list condition; after treatment, the CBITS group mean scores were in the nonclinical range, whereas mean scores for the wait list group remained in the clinical range (large effect size). Significantly lower scores in the intervention group were also seen for depression and psychosocial dysfunction.

Typical PTSD symptoms are manifestations of young children&rsquo;s basic fears (eg, body damage, abandonment, loss of caregiver). With limited verbal and cognitive abilities, young children are particularly dependent on and trusting of caregivers to provide safety. When trauma occurs, this safety and trust is disrupted. </p><p>Effective trauma treatments for young children must rebuild the young child&rsquo;s trust that the caregiver will keep the child safe and the caregiver&rsquo;s ability to do so. This has been accomplished through attachment-based models that primarily focus on the child-parent relationship and by CBT models that focus on enhancing child-parent resiliency skills, communication, positive parenting, and the caregiver&rsquo;s ability to promote safety. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H758923\"><span class=\"h3\">Child-Parent Psychotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP), developed for young children (birth to six years) who have experienced a trauma and their parent(s) or caretaking adult, is a dyadic attachment-based psychotherapy focused on supporting and strengthening the parent-child relationship as a way to heal the negative impacts of interpersonal trauma. Although CPP has some CBT elements, it is primarily based on attachment and psychodynamic theory. CPP is particularly valuable for very young children (birth to three years) and other young children (eg, those with developmental delays) who cannot express their emotions verbally but do so through play; the CPP therapist helps the parent to understand and make more benign meaning of the child&rsquo;s play, behaviors, and interactions with the parent. </p><p>As a longer-term treatment approach (one year), CPP provides more sustained interventions to the child and parent and thus may be particularly helpful for parents who are highly dysregulated due to personal experiences of domestic violence.

After one year of weekly sessions monitored for fidelity, children receiving CPP experienced greater improvement in PTSD symptoms (medium effect size), as well as for total behavior problems (small effect size), relative to children receiving the comparison condition. Mothers receiving CPP also exhibited significantly greater decrease in avoidance symptoms and a trend toward reduction in their own personal PTSD symptoms. </p><p>CPP is provided in 40 to 50 weekly dyadic child-parent sessions with additional parent sessions provided as needed. Clinicians typically monitor young children&rsquo;s PTSD and behavioral symptoms systematically; a developmentally appropriate instrument should be used, such as the <a href=\"http://www.infantinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/YCPC_v5_23_14.pdf&amp;token=zo2wjcUklAr6TufBtRvTgJBgSOwevNFCAyWM9Z9JTN4BZc84yvDsVWfnIbYKLzagV2nOkJQnxqOBdjbMsJDovOsJTk0HwDd3FWRrtbAwAemvALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=99647\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">YCPC</a> described above.

A clinical trial comparing CISD with a wait list control in 132 children following road traffic accidents found no difference in preventing the development of PTSD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-interventions-for-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-treating-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to treating posttraumatic stress disorder in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several trauma-focused psychotherapy models have been found to be efficacious in the treatment of PTSD or PTSD symptoms beneath the diagnostic threshold for the disorder. These interventions include individual and group models, as well as models tailored to meet the needs of specific subgroups. (See <a href=\"#H407869\" class=\"local\">'Trauma-focused psychotherapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>School-based screening and group therapy interventions are an efficacious and relatively cost-effective means of providing trauma-focused therapy. The most extensively evaluated and disseminated model is Cognitive-Behavioral Interventions for Trauma in Schools. (See <a href=\"#H113157192\" class=\"local\">'Group therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effective trauma-focused psychotherapies for young children seek to rebuild the child&rsquo;s trust that the caregiver is willing and able to keep the child safe. Interventions found to be efficacious include Child-Parent Psychotherapy, an attachment based model, (Trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) for Preschoolers, and Preschool PTSD Treatment. (See <a href=\"#H113157199\" class=\"local\">'Therapies for preschool children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychosocial interventions have been developed to treat both PTSD and substance use disorders in patients with these dual diagnoses. Seeking Safety is an adult, group CBT model that has been modified for teens. Risk Reduction Family Therapy is an application of TF-CBT that includes additional components for reducing risk of substance abuse. (See <a href=\"#H410193\" class=\"local\">'Therapies for PTSD and SUD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Child and Family Traumatic Stress Intervention, a CBT-based intervention developed for delivery in the first month after acute trauma exposure, aiming to prevent the subsequent development of PTSD, was found in a clinical trial to reduce the proportion of patients subsequently diagnosed with PTSD. Critical incident stress debriefing, a one-session debriefing session following trauma exposure, has been found to be ineffective in children and adults.
