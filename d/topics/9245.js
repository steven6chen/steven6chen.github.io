Five years ago, he developed polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, and lost 23 lbs over a four-month period. A random blood glucose level was 277 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (15.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. The glycated hemoglobin (A1C) was 10.8 percent. The patient was treated with medical nutrition therapy and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> 1000 mg twice a day with meals.</p><p>The patient adhered to his regimen. His symptoms resolved, and he regained 18 lbs. He states that he performs self-blood glucose monitoring once or twice a day. The fasting blood glucose values are in the 110 to 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6.1 to 6.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> range. Values before supper are 115 to 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6.3 to 7.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. With treatment, the A1C level improved to the 8.9 to 9.5 range; the most recent value, nine weeks ago, was 9.1 percent.</p><p>The patient developed distal sensory neuropathy six months after the diagnosis of diabetes. He complains of tenderness in the bottoms of his feet. He feels that he is &quot;walking on nerves,&quot; that he has &quot;no fat in his feet,&quot; and that he is &quot;walking on bone.&quot; His symptoms are alleviated by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> but are still present. He has erectile dysfunction. He also has hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease.</p><p>The patient's examination reveals a blood pressure of <span class=\"nowrap\">120/70</span> in the right arm supine and <span class=\"nowrap\">140/85</span> in the right arm upright. The heart rate is 60 regular. The weight is 207 lbs, height 5' 9&quot;, body mass index (BMI) 30.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span>. Peripheral pulses are intact in both lower extremities. Light touch is nearly absent to the knees. Vibration sense is mildly reduced at the great toes, slightly reduced at the medial malleoli, and intact at the tibial tubercles. The knee jerks and ankle jerks are absent bilaterally. In addition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a>, the patient's medications are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a> 20 mg once a day, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> 25 mg once a day, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> 900 mg three times a day, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> 81 mg once a day.</p><p>Based on the A1C values, his clinician suspects that the glucose values at home are erroneous. The clinician is concerned that the patient already has distal sensory neuropathy and erectile dysfunction and may develop other complications. The clinician has advised the patient to add <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glipizide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glipizide</a> 5 mg before breakfast and supper to his regimen. The patient insists that the glucose readings at home are correct. He has already changed his meter to a different brand and reviewed his testing technique with a diabetes nurse educator.</p><p>What is your assessment and plan?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You share the concern of the previous clinician that the patient is at high risk of additional diabetic complications based on repeatedly elevated A1C values. You suspect that the patient is not measuring or reporting his glucoses accurately. You refer him to another diabetes nurse educator to assess the function of his glucometer and to review his testing technique. You advise him to begin <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glipizide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glipizide</a> but suggest that he start more cautiously with a dose of 2.5 mg before breakfast and supper.

You order yet another A1C and advise the patient to continue the current medications and not to add <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glipizide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glipizide</a> at this time.

You suspect that the patient is not adhering to his diet. You refer him to a registered dietitian to review his diet and to learn to count carbohydrates.

You are concerned that he has postprandial hyperglycemia not detected by pre-meal and bedtime glucose testing. You advise him to check the blood glucose values more often, specifically before each meal, one hour after each meal, and at bedtime.
