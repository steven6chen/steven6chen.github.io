It provides a nonsurgical option for pregnancy prevention that is as effective as surgical sterilization. The most frequently used intrauterine devices have a plastic frame and release either copper or a progestin to enhance the contraceptive action of the device. </p><p>Several terms are used to describe IUDs, including IUD and intrauterine contraception; the hormonal IUD or progestin-containing device is also referred to as an intrauterine system. In this topic, we use the term IUD for all types of intrauterine devices.</p><p>This topic will discuss types of intrauterine devices and their mechanism of action.

Pregnancy appears to be prevented by a foreign body effect induced by the IUD frame and by local changes caused by the released medication. When the uterus is exposed to a foreign body, a sterile inflammatory reaction occurs, which is toxic to sperm and ova and impairs implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-background-and-device-types/abstract/16,18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18-21</a>]. The production of cytotoxic peptides and activation of enzymes lead to inhibition of sperm motility, reduced sperm capacitation and survival, and sperm phagocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-background-and-device-types/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. These cytotoxic effects are supported by studies in which fallopian tubes of IUD users were flushed but no sperm or fertilized ova were found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-background-and-device-types/abstract/16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18</a>].

Compared with users of the LNg IUDs, copper IUD users have a greater risk of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) if exposed to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-background-and-device-types/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The difference in risk of PID is believed to be due to a progestin-mediated reduction in upper-tract infection in LNg IUD users rather than an increased risk in copper IUD users.

Women under age 25 experience a slightly higher failure rate, most likely because they are more fertile than older women. These failure rates are comparable with surgical sterilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-background-and-device-types/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>While failure rates for both IUDs are low overall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57795 \">figure 1</a>), the rates of failure with the copper IUD are somewhat higher than with progestin-releasing IUDs. In one study of over 58,000 women, the copper IUD first-year failure rate was 0.52 versus 0.06 pregnancies per 100 woman-years for the LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/5</span> IUD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-background-and-device-types/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In addition, the ectopic pregnancy rate was higher for copper IUDs than the LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/5</span> IUD (0.08 versus 0.02 ectopic pregnancies per 100 woman-years). Of note, the copper IUD study group contained more than 30 types of copper IUDs, which may have impacted the results. As an example, IUDs with less than 380 mm<sup>2</sup> of copper and inert IUDs are less effective than those containing &ge;380 mm<sup>2</sup> of copper [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-background-and-device-types/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2120956538\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The TCu380A is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to remain in place for 10 years; this may vary elsewhere. However, some clinicians use the TCu380A for more than 10 years before exchanging it for a new IUD. The use of the TCu380A beyond 10 years is supported by several studies.

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) appear to decrease menstrual blood loss and bleeding duration, particularly in women with heavy or prolonged bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-background-and-device-types/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].

We also inform women ages 40 and older that LNg and copper IUDs are more effective than inert IUDs but do not encourage switching if the patient is happy with her device.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H900335933\"><span class=\"h2\">Frameless IUDs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Frameless IUDs, which are available outside of the United States, contain either copper or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> that has been attached to a nonresorbable filament. The GyneFix 330 is made up of copper cylinders threaded onto a polypropylene suture instead of the plastic frame common to other IUDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrauterine-contraception-background-and-device-types/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>].

These devices are anchored to the endometrium using an insertion technique that requires additional training as the technique is different from the other types of IUDs.

Two types of IUDs are available in the United States (US), copper-containing and levonorgestrel-releasing (LNg) devices. The levonorgestresl-releasing devices are available in multiple formulations. (See <a href=\"#H2652248308\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence of use'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2539229221\" class=\"local\">'Types of IUDs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple mechanisms appear to contribute to the contraceptive action of IUDs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61064\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61064 \">table 1</a>). Pregnancy appears to be prevented by a foreign body effect induced by the IUD frame and by local changes caused by the released medication. (See <a href=\"#H4226625111\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of action'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are multiple benefits to IUD use, including that IUDs are one of the most effective methods of contraception (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57795\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57795 \">figure 1</a>), which result in high user satisfaction rates. The IUD is also cost-effective when used over multiple years. (See <a href=\"#H287629986\" class=\"local\">'Benefits'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2860300596\" class=\"local\">'Cost effectiveness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The TCu380A contains a T-shaped polyethylene frame with 380 mm<sup>2</sup> of exposed surface consisting of fine copper wire wound around a vertical stem and copper collars on each of the horizontal arms; a 3 mm ball at the base of the stem decreases the risk of cervical perforation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56136\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56136 \">picture 1</a>). The TCu380A can also be used for emergency contraception and left in place for continued contraception. (See <a href=\"#H717555817\" class=\"local\">'Characteristics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>With perfect use, the probability of pregnancy in the first year is 0.6 percent; with typical use, the first year pregnancy rate is 0.5 to 0.8 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80860\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80860 \">table 2</a>). While failure rates for both copper and levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs are low overall, the rates of failure with the copper IUD are somewhat higher than with progestin-releasing IUDs. (See <a href=\"#H3303250880\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the US, the TCu380A is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved to remain in place for 10 years. However, this may vary elsewhere as the use of the TCu380A beyond 10 years is supported by several studies. (See <a href=\"#H2120956538\" class=\"local\">'Duration of use'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women considering the copper IUD are counseled that menses may be heavier, longer, or more painful, particularly in the first several cycles after insertion. These changes in menstrual symptoms generally do not cause women to remove the IUD and rarely lead to anemia. (See <a href=\"#H1699895137\" class=\"local\">'Copper IUD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are four types of levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs available in the US, with progestin-release rates ranging from 14 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81587\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81587 \">picture 2</a>). The progestin effect of hormone-releasing IUDs is primarily at the level of the endometrium. (See <a href=\"#H1022746683\" class=\"local\">'Devices and characteristics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>With perfect use of the LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/5,</span> the probability of pregnancy in the first year is 0.1 percent; with typical use, the first-year pregnancy rate is 0.1 to 0.2 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80860\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80860 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2367096684\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The duration of use varies with the type of LNg IUD. The&nbsp;LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/5&nbsp;IUD</span> is approved for up to five years of use by the FDA, although evidence supports extended use beyond five years. Studies are ongoing for the&nbsp;LNg <span class=\"nowrap\">52/4,</span> which is currently approved for four years. (See <a href=\"#H730430409\" class=\"local\">'Duration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Noncontraceptive benefits of 52 mg LNg IUDs include reduction in menorrhagia, anemia, dysmenorrhea, endometriosis-related pain, endometrial hyperplasia, pelvic inflammatory disease, and cervical cancer. (See <a href=\"#H3320673538\" class=\"local\">'Noncontraceptive benefits'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inert, or unmedicated, IUDs are approved for use outside the US and are popular because they can remain in place for 20 years or more. The devices are composed of inert materials such as plastic or stainless steel. (See <a href=\"#H711697880\" class=\"local\">'Inert IUDs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frameless IUDs, which are available outside of the US, contain either copper or LNg that has been attached to a nonresorbable filament.
