By comparison, higher rates of resistant disease have been observed in clinical practice.

Both are associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA), have similar features on renal histology (eg, a focal necrotizing, pauci-immune, crescentic glomerulonephritis), and have somewhat different clinical features and outcomes. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclophosphamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> in combination with glucocorticoids are usually used for initial immunosuppressive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment-resistant GPA or MPA is diagnosed if one or both of the following are present despite optimal immunosuppressive therapy for an adequate period (usually six months, or three months in a patient who is dialysis dependent) (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Identification of treatment resistance'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A progressive decline in renal function (ie, increase in serum creatinine) plus persistence of an active urine sediment (ie, dysmorphic hematuria with or without red cell casts)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Persistence or new appearance of extrarenal manifestations of active vasculitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients are incorrectly considered to be treatment resistant. The most important causes of misdiagnosis are: permanent tissue damage due to previous inflammatory injury; nonadherence to therapy; inadequate initial immunosuppression; and medication toxicity. Thus, tissue biopsy may be necessary in some patients to differentiate recurrent vasculitis from infection or damage due to scarring from previously active disease. However, biopsy is not necessary if there is clear evidence of new active inflammation. (See <a href=\"#H733588165\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of treatment resistance appears to be lower in clinical trials than clinical practice. In five major randomized clinical trials of ANCA-associated vasculitis, approximately 60 to 90 percent of enrolled patients achieved disease remission within six months of treatment, and 10 to 40 percent were resistant.
