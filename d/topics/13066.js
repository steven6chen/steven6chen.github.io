IgA deposits may also be seen on kidney biopsy in individuals with no evidence of renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The reported incidence of mesangial IgA deposition in apparently healthy individuals ranges from 3 to 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. These cases had no clinical features of nephritis, but their renal biopsy was consistent with IgA nephropathy.</p><p>This observation raises three important points:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a large cohort of undiagnosed &quot;latent&quot; IgA nephropathy in the general population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>This must be considered when genetic studies are undertaken comparing gene polymorphisms in IgA nephropathy with normal &quot;healthy&quot; populations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It raises an important consideration for the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy: The process of mesangial IgA deposition is likely to be separate from the induction of glomerular injury, and IgA deposition does not necessarily need to be followed by nephritis. Identifying the factors common to both processes is essential to our overall understanding of the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy.</p><p/><p>There are also a number of reports documenting IgA deposition in other forms of glomerulonephritis. These particularly include thin basement membrane nephropathy, lupus nephritis, minimal change disease, and diabetic nephropathy. These findings are most probably due to chance associations since IgA deposition is common in the general population.</p><p>The pathogenesis and etiology of IgA nephropathy will be reviewed here. The clinical presentation and diagnosis and the treatment and prognosis of this disorder are discussed separately.

Codeposits of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and complement (C3 but usually not C1q) are also commonly seen and may contribute to disease severity. Mesangial deposition of secretory IgA has also been reported, but the pathogenic significance of this is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>There are <strong>four</strong> key elements that contribute to IgA nephropathy, and the extent to which each is operational determines the severity, course, and eventual outcome of IgA nephropathy in any individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generation of circulating IgA immune complexes with chemical and biological characteristics that favor mesangial deposition</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ability of the reticuloendothelial system to effectively remove potentially pathogenic IgA immune complexes or under-glycosylated IgA1 aggregates from the circulation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mesangial cell affinity for and reaction to mesangial under-glycosylated IgA1 accumulation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The inherent tendency of the kidney to respond to injury by mounting a response favoring progressive renal injury with glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis, rather than resolution of inflammation without these sequelae</p><p/><p>The mechanisms of secondary renal injury are probably similar to those underlying other forms of chronic kidney disease and are discussed separately.

Thus, patients with IgA nephropathy must produce a pool of circulating IgA molecules with special characteristics that promote mesangial deposition.</p><p>The heterogeneity in reported abnormalities suggests that there is more than one mechanism leading to the production of pathogenic circulating IgA immune complexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The following are some of the described abnormalities in circulating IgA and its production in IgA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The serum IgA is anionic, and lambda light chains are overrepresented.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is an increase in the amount of polymeric IgA in the serum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a high proportion of poorly O-galactosylated IgA1.

This increase in poorly galactosylated IgA1 O-glycoforms is found in serum IgA, as well as in IgA1 eluted from isolated renal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/10,11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,13</a>]. Similar findings have been reported in children with either IgA nephropathy or IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura) nephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, patients with IgA nephropathy can produce immunoglobulin D (IgD) that is highly galactosylated, and, therefore, it is unlikely that there is an overarching &quot;defect&quot; in immunoglobulin O-glycosylation in IgA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, only a small fraction of serum IgA1 is poorly galactosylated, and only a small proportion of IgA1-committed plasma cells are synthesizing these poorly O-galactosylated glycoforms of IgA1.</p><p>Of note, these poorly galactosylated IgA1 O-glycoforms are referred to in the literature variably as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Galactose-deficient IgA1&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Poorly galactosylated IgA1&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Under-glycosylated IgA1&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Aberrantly glycosylated IgA1&quot;</p><p/><p>Existing data would suggest that these IgA1 molecules are produced by mucosally primed plasma cells and that this IgA1 is, in fact, appropriately O-glycosylated for mucosal-derived IgA; it is therefore not structurally &quot;abnormal,&quot; &quot;aberrant,&quot; or &quot;deficient.&quot; Thus, we will use the term poorly galactosylated IgA1 to describe what is believed to be the pathogenic form of IgA1 in IgA nephropathy. This poorly galactosylated IgA1 is the normal O-glycosylated form of IgA1 produced at mucosal surfaces, and its increased presence in the serum and mesangium likely reflects a subtle dysregulation of the mucosal immune system in IgA nephropathy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Source and regulation of pathogenic IgA synthesis'</a> below.)</p><p>Poorly galactosylated IgA1 O-glycoforms have an increased tendency to both self-aggregate (perhaps due to the different physiological environment of plasma compared with mucosal secretions) and form antigen-antibody complexes with IgA and IgG antibodies directed against an N-acetylgalactosamine residue in the IgA1 hinge region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. Both mechanisms favor the generation of macromolecular aggregates of polymeric IgA1 and IgA-immune complexes, which are more likely to deposit in the mesangium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Serum levels of antibodies directed against poorly O-galactosylated IgA1 are associated with disease activity and progressive kidney disease in IgA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/13,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,21,22</a>].</p><p>IgG antibodies against poorly O-galactosylated IgA1 contain a specific amino acid sequence, Y1CS3, in the heavy chain variable region that differs from a Y1CA3 sequence in similar isotype-matched healthy control patients. The S3 residue, which has been shown to be critical for binding to poorly galactosylated IgA1, is not observed in germline DNA and appears to be the result of a somatic mutation that may be influenced by exposure to specific environmental antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/17,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,23</a>].</p><p>IgA1 molecules lacking terminal galactose units have increased in vitro affinity for the extracellular matrix components fibronectin and type IV collagen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], which will promote mesangial deposition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22581759\"><span class=\"h4\">Genetic control of IgA1 O-galactosylation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is evidence to suggest that genetic factors play an important role in determining an individual's serum IgA1 O-glycoform profile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. As an example, high serum levels of poorly galactosylated IgA1 have been identified in 47 and 25 percent of first-degree relatives of patients with familial and sporadic IgA nephropathy, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The heritability of poorly O-galactosylated IgA1 among familial IgA nephropathy cohorts has been estimated between 54 and 76 percent. In a study of healthy monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs, the heritability of serum levels of poorly galactosylated IgA1 was found to be as high as 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, in this same study, the heritability of serum IgA levels was only 46 percent, suggesting that O-glycosylation of IgA1 is independent of serum IgA level. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Genetic predisposition'</a> below.)</p><p>Higher serum levels of poorly galactosylated IgA1 have been associated with a polymorphism in the gene-encoding core 1 synthase, glycoprotein-N-acetylgalactosamine 3-beta-galactosyltransferase 1 (<em>C1GALT1</em>), one of the enzymes responsible for O-galactosylation of IgA1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. In one study of Caucasian and Chinese populations, this association was not confined to patients with IgA nephropathy but was also identified in healthy subjects and patients with membranous nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Although IgA nephropathy is more common in Chinese compared with Caucasian populations, a lower frequency of the <em>C1GALT1</em> risk haplotype was observed in the Chinese cohort, which corresponded with lower serum levels of poorly galactosylated IgA1 among Chinese patients with IgA nephropathy versus Caucasian cases. These findings suggest that factors other than IgA1 O-galactosylation are likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy among different ethnic populations.</p><p>In addition to genetic factors, the expression of <em>C1GALT1</em>, and therefore the O-galactosylation of IgA1, is also regulated by microRNA (miRNA). MiRNAs are endogenous, small (18 to 24 nucleotides long), noncoding, single-stranded RNAs that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Specifically, miRNAs bind to the messenger RNAs of various genes and lead to their degradation.</p><p>In a study that examined the miRNA profile of 75 patients with IgA nephropathy and 75 healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], the following findings were observed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukocytes from patients with IgA nephropathy overexpressed a specific miRNA (miR-148b), and overexpression of miR-148b correlated with decreased expression of C1GAL-T1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The upregulation of miR-0148b was also associated with poor O-galactosylation of IgA1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The binding site for miR-0148b on the messenger RNA of C1GAL-T1 corresponded to the C1GAL-T1 polymorphism that was associated with IgA nephropathy in previous studies.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22581672\"><span class=\"h3\">Alterations of IgA1 sialylation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Changes in sialylation of IgA1 in IgA nephropathy are more contentious with increased and decreased O-sialylation being reported. Increased alpha2,3-linked and alpha2,6-linked sialylation of serum IgA1 have been reported, and it has been suggested that this increase inhibits interaction with the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) on liver cells resulting in a reduced rate of systemic clearance of IgA-immune complexes and persistence of these IgA-immune complexes in the circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>].</p><p>IgA-immune complexes with a high sialic acid content bind mesangial cells more strongly, differentially upregulate mesangial cell integrins and nitric oxide synthesis, and induce apoptosis and suppress mesangial cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>]. In addition, it has been postulated that sialylated IgA1 is more likely to bind extracellular matrix components because of its net negative charge. In contrast, a number of studies have reported reduced sialylation of serum IgA1 and tonsillar IgA1 in IgA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The significance of reduced IgA1 sialylation is equally contentious, with studies reporting that reduced sialylation plays a variable role in IgA1 self-aggregation and IgA-immune complex formation, mesangial cell proliferation and activation, and histopathological phenotype in IgA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Crucial to the interpretation of all these studies is the reliability and specificity of the lectins used to analyze the alpha2,3-linked and alpha2,6-linked sialic acid content of IgA1. Existing mass spectrometry data support IgA1 being undersialylated in IgA nephropathy; whether this relates to the alpha2,3- or alpha2,6-linked sialic acid or both is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/10,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Source and regulation of pathogenic IgA synthesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The association of episodic visible hematuria with mucosal infections originally led to the hypothesis that IgA nephropathy was linked with abnormal mucosal antigen handling. This was supported by the observation that mesangial IgA and the increased IgA fraction in the serum are polymeric, which is normally produced at mucosal surfaces rather than in systemic immune sites. However, mucosal polymeric IgA plasma cell numbers are normal or even reduced in IgA nephropathy, and polymeric IgA antibody levels are not elevated in mucosal secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>Mucosal IgA responses to mucosal antigen challenge are also reduced, compared with healthy controls. This mucosal hyporesponsiveness, while perhaps not clinically relevant, argues against the mucosal IgA system being the source of the pathogenic fraction of serum IgA.</p><p>In contrast, there is an increase in polymeric IgA1 plasma cells in the bone marrow of patients with IgA nephropathy, and these are believed to be derived from mucosally primed B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Systemic antigen challenge results in increased titers of circulating polymeric IgA1 antibodies (displaying a mucosal phenotype), which are thought, largely, to be derived from these dislocated, mucosally primed plasma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>]. Thus, the overproduction of polymeric &quot;mucosal-type&quot; IgA1 in the serum is likely to stem from an aberrant mucosal immune response resulting in mistrafficking of &quot;mucosal&quot; plasma cells to systemic sites due to defective homing during mucosal immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In addition to the bone marrow, the tonsils may also be a source of abnormal IgA that forms immune complexes and deposits in the glomeruli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. As examples, a number of in vitro studies have demonstrated synthesis of poorly galactosylated polymeric IgA1 by tonsillar B cells, and there have been reports of a fall in serum levels of poorly galactosylated IgA following tonsillectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, there is a range of opinions as to the importance of the tonsils in IgA nephropathy. The data evaluating the possible efficacy of tonsillectomy as a therapy for IgA nephropathy are presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-iga-nephropathy#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of IgA nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Tonsillectomy'</a>.)</p><p>Although the specific mechanisms that control IgA synthesis in the various immune sites are not well defined, systemic production of IgA appears to be under similar T cell control mechanisms to IgG production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. As with other immunoglobulin isotypes, type 2 T cell cytokines (interleukin [IL]-4, -5, and -6) promote B cell class switching to IgA and subsequent proliferation and differentiation of IgA producing cells. IgA production is also specifically and potently promoted by the cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, which have suppressive effects on IgG production. The control of mucosal IgA production is less well understood, although T helper type 2 (Th2) T cells are undoubtedly involved. An imbalance of type 1 and type 2 T cell subsets has been proposed as an explanation for the dysregulated IgA responses seen in IgA nephropathy. In addition, there is provisional work suggesting that types 1 and 2 cytokines differentially affect IgA1 O-glycosylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>A specific subpopulation of B lymphocytes (CD5+ CD19+ B cells) that do not require T cell regulation for immunoglobulin production have been implicated in many immune-mediated diseases. These lymphocytes are known to produce low-affinity IgA with many of the features characteristic of pathogenic IgA and are increased in the peripheral blood of patients with IgA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Changes in CD5+ CD19+ B cell populations may underlie, in part, the dysregulated IgA secretion seen in IgA nephropathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Impaired IgA clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impaired systemic clearance of IgA promotes IgA deposition in the mesangium. Persistent mesangial IgA accumulation occurs by one or both of two mechanisms: The rate of IgA deposition exceeds the mesangial clearance capacity, or the deposited IgA is resistant to mesangial clearance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Systemic clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alterations in systemic IgA and IgA-immune complex clearance mechanisms will facilitate their persistence in the serum. The liver plays an important role in IgA clearance from the circulation, and radiolabeled IgA clearance studies suggest reduced hepatic clearance in IgA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Reduced galactosylation of the IgA1 hinge region may affect its uptake by the asialoglycoprotein receptor on hepatocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. However, one study suggests that IgA1 is cleared minimally by the liver and that this process is not affected by the absence of the hinge region; thus, the importance of hepatic clearance of IgA1 in IgA nephropathy is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. A second route of IgA clearance is through CD89, a fragment, crystallizable (Fc) receptor for IgA expressed by myeloid and Kupffer cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. IgA nephropathy is associated with downregulated CD89 expression on circulating myeloid cells, resulting in reduced clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. It has been proposed that this downregulation is a direct consequence of binding of poorly galactosylated IgA1-containing immune complexes with CD89 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Mesangial clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mesangial IgA deposition is not always associated with the development of glomerular inflammation.

A number of candidate receptors on the mesangial cell have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/61-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-67</a>], including the transferrin receptor (CD71), which binds IgA and aberrantly glycosylated polymeric IgA1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>].</p><p>It is possible that impaired binding of IgA to mesangial cell receptor(s) could lead to defective mesangial IgA clearance and thereby contribute to IgA accumulation and the development of glomerular injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Development of glomerular injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IgA nephropathy is generally not associated with a marked cellular glomerular infiltration, suggesting that glomerular injury is mediated by resident glomerular cells.

In addition, polymeric IgA appears to stimulate the production of a variety of proinflammatory and profibrotic molecules, such as IL-6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/9,73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,73,74</a>]. Expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B and D chains, proteins known to be important in the pathogenesis of mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis, are upregulated in glomeruli in IgA nephropathy and have been shown in mouse models to induce marked mesangial cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>].</p><p>Codeposition of IgG may synergistically contribute to the development of a proinflammatory phenotype in mesangial cells, thereby influencing the degree of glomerular injury and clinical outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/77-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-80</a>]. Further studies to determine the precise pathogenic role of IgG codeposition in IgA nephropathy are needed.

C3 is codeposited with IgA in over 90 percent of patients with IgA nephropathy. Both the alternative and lectin pathways may be activated, leading to generation of the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a and the membrane attack complex C5b-9, with subsequent promotion of inflammatory mediator and matrix protein production by mesangial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/89-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">89-92</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-iga-nephropathy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of IgA nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Pathology'</a>.)</p><p>Lectin pathway activation occurs in a subset of patients and is associated with worse renal injury, highlighting the heterogeneous nature of this condition. In a biopsy series, one-fourth of patients displayed evidence of lectin pathway activation (as determined by glomerular deposition of mannose-binding lectin [MBL], L-ficolin, MBL-associated serine protease [MASP], and C4d), and these patients had increased proteinuria and renal damage compared with those with no lectin pathway involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. In another study, approximately one-third of patients had evidence of lectin pathway activation (mesangial C4d deposition in the absence of the classical pathway component C1q), and these patients had a marked reduction in 10-year renal survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. MBL is able to bind to polymeric IgA, but not monomeric IgA, and its binding results in activation of C3 and C4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p>Other studies suggest that factor H, a regulator of the alternative pathway, and the complement factor H-related (CFHR) proteins play an important role in IgA nephropathy. Two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the complement factor H <span class=\"nowrap\">(CFH)/CFHR</span> locus, resulting in deletion of CFHR-3 and CFHR-1, protects against the risk of developing IgA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>]. CFHR-3 and CFHR-1 compete with the binding of factor H to C3, and their deletion results in uninhibited factor H-C3 binding and downregulation of the alternative pathway; conversely, an increase in their levels leads to increased alternative pathway activity. CFHR-1 levels have been shown to be increased in two cohorts of IgA nephropathy patients and associated with progressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>].</p><p>There is also evidence for systemic activation of complement in a subpopulation of patients with IgA nephropathy, with elevated levels of split products of activated C3 reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p>C3 and MBL are synthesized locally by mesangial cells and podocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]; it is possible that the binding of polymeric IgA to mesangial cells incites local complement activation independent of systemic complement activity. The contribution of this in situ complement synthesis and activation to progressive glomerular injury is unknown. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of immune injury of the glomerulus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The increasing ability to perform mass spectrometry-based proteomics in glomerular disease may be an interesting approach to further define components, including complement, within immune deposits and to delineate the intracellular signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of IgA nephropathy is unknown in the great majority of cases. The possibility that infections contribute to the underlying pathogenesis of this disorder has been explored, as have genetic associations.</p><p>It has also been suggested that IgA nephropathy results from hypersensitivity to food antigens, in view of its association with celiac disease. There is, however, no evidence for widespread hypersensitivity to food antigens in IgA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p>In our opinion, IgA nephropathy is, at least in part, an autoimmune disease resulting from dysregulation of mucosal-type IgA immune responses. The autoantigens are a specific set of IgA1 O-glycoforms displaying poor O-linked galactosylation of the IgA1 hinge region. These O-glycoforms result in the generation of hinge glycan-specific IgA and immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies in susceptible individuals. As a result, any mucosal infection or food antigen may drive the production and release of pathogenic IgA into the circulation where it has the propensity to deposit within the mesangium and trigger glomerular injury. Why patients with IgA nephropathy are predisposed to high levels of these IgA1 O-glycoform autoantigens remains unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The provocation of visible hematuria by mucosal infection in patients with IgA nephropathy and the presumption that the mesangial IgA represented deposited immune complexes led to the view that IgA nephropathy was a complication of infection. Cytomegalovirus, <em>Haemophilus parainfluenzae</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, and toxoplasmosis have been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/103-109\" class=\"abstract_t\">103-109</a>].</p><p>As an example, in a clinical study from Japan, renal biopsy specimens from 116 patients with IgA nephropathy and 122 patients with other types of kidney disease were examined for the presence of <em>S. aureus</em> antigen in the glomeruli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Although antigen was not detected in non-IgA disease, 68 percent of specimens from patients with IgA nephropathy had <em>S. aureus</em> cell envelope antigen localized with IgA antibody in the glomeruli. Another report from Japan suggested that, at least in that region, the inciting event may be pharyngeal colonization with <em>H. parainfluenzae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].</p><p>With respect to a possible viral etiology, Mx-proteins in white blood cells, which are induced by type 1 interferon responses to viral infections, are not increased in IgA nephropathy, nor are Mx-protein deposits found in the glomeruli, as might have been expected if ongoing viral infection contributed to the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>].</p><p>While a number of different exogenous antigens have been identified in glomerular deposits in IgA nephropathy, this observation is not consistently reported across all studies. As a result, it seems more probable that the development of IgA nephropathy is a consequence of aberrant IgA immune response rather than the antigen (infecting organism) itself. Support for this view comes from genetic studies that identified susceptibility loci in genes that influence the immune response to intestinal pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic predisposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although IgA nephropathy is considered a sporadic disease, its presence among certain families suggests there may be a genetic predisposition, at least in some individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>].</p><p>A familial incidence has been described in the United States (in eastern Kentucky) and elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/113-118\" class=\"abstract_t\">113-118</a>]. This relationship may be independent of environmental factors and may reflect an inherited susceptibility to develop mesangial glomerulonephritis. One study in Italy, for example, studied 269 asymptomatic, first-degree relatives of patients with IgA nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. Persistent microscopic hematuria was found in 42 patients (15.6 percent); biopsy confirmed the presence of IgA nephropathy in four of these patients.</p><p>Familial IgA nephropathy and susceptibility to sporadic IgA nephropathy are most likely due to variants in multiple loci involving both the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and non-MHC susceptibility alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-iga-nephropathy/abstract/95,111,118-132\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,111,118-132</a>].</p><p>The frequency of subclinical IgA nephropathy in supposedly &quot;normal&quot; control populations means that most of the genetic studies thus far reported are examining clinical expression and not susceptibility to disease. In addition, most of these studies suffer from not having taken into account the phenomenon of &quot;population stratification&quot; and thus may represent &quot;false positives&quot; due to ancestry.</p><p>Genetic study of IgA nephropathy is further complicated by the uncertainty as to whether IgA nephropathy is truly a single entity and the presence of subclinical IgA nephropathy in apparently normal control populations. Taken together, available genetic studies suggest that IgA nephropathy is a genetically heterogeneous entity that does not have classic Mendelian inheritance attributable to a single gene locus but is a complex polygenic disease probably involving both MHC and non-MHC susceptibility alleles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology of primary immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy is generally unknown.
