When people have a frozen shoulder, the tissue around the shoulder joint gets thick and tight. This might happen after a person's shoulder gets hurt or if he or she has shoulder surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26854784\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a frozen shoulder?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with a frozen shoulder usually have a stiff and painful shoulder and trouble reaching overhead or around to their lower back.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26854791\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. Your doctor or nurse will talk with you and do an exam. Often that is all that is needed to diagnose frozen shoulder. But your doctor or nurse might want to do an imaging test, such as an X-ray or MRI scan. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26854798\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a frozen shoulder treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, a frozen shoulder will get better on its own, but it can take months to heal completely. To help your shoulder get better, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest your shoulder &ndash; Avoiding raising your arm overhead, reaching, and lifting things.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a pain-relieving medicine &ndash; Ask your doctor or nurse about taking an over-the-counter medicine for pain, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask your doctor about exercises that can help &ndash; At first, the most important thing to do is to rest your shoulder. Later, when the worst of the pain has passed, ask your doctor if it's safe to start trying some simple exercises. If he or she says it's OK, you can slowly start to do certain exercises (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F89999\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89999 \">picture 1</a>). After you are comfortable with simple range of motion exercises, your doctor, nurse, or physical therapist (exercise expert) can suggest some other exercises to make the shoulder muscles stronger. He or she can show you how to do these exercises and tell you when to start them and how often to do them. Any time you do shoulder exercises, make sure to start slowly and make the exercises harder over time. Also, know that some pain is normal, but it's important not to push it. If you have sharp or tearing pain, stop what you're doing and let your doctor or nurse know.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26854812\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my shoulder doesn't get better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your symptoms don't get better, talk with your doctor or nurse about other possible treatments, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting a shot of medicine or fluid into the shoulder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26854819\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-injury-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rotator cuff injury (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=frozen-shoulder-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Frozen shoulder (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinitis-and-tear-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Rotator cuff tendinitis and tear (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
