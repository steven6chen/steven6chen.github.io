In a report in which 186 recurrences occurred in 101 patients, the site of recurrence was arterial in 93 percent of those with an initial arterial thrombosis, and the site of recurrence was venous in 76 percent of those with an initial venous thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

These complications include fetal death after 10 weeks gestation, premature birth due to severe preeclampsia or placental insufficiency, or embryonic losses (&lt;10 weeks gestation). Fetal loss in patients with aPL and the approach to women with recurrent fetal loss are discussed in detail separately.

Stroke and transient ischemic attack are the most common neurologic manifestations of APS. A thrombotic stroke occurring in a young patient with no overt risk factors for cerebrovascular disease is a classic setting in which to suspect APS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Ischemic stroke may be a manifestation in situ thrombosis or due to embolism arising from valvular heart disease. If routine transthoracic echocardiography is normal, transesophageal echocardiography may be indicated to assess for vegetations due to nonbacterial endocarditis. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac involvement'</a> below.)</p><p>Sneddon syndrome, which is characterized by widespread livedo reticularis in association with a stroke, has also been described among patients with APS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. In almost half of all cases, Sneddon syndrome is associated with detectable aPL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Cognitive deficits <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> white matter lesions have been associated with APS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. The degree of reported cognitive deficits ranges from subtle findings to transient global amnesia to permanent and profound cognitive functioning. The cognitive deficits reported in APS are sometimes but not always associated with white matter lesions. As an example, cognitive deficits were evaluated in a study of 60 patients with primary or secondary APS who underwent comprehensive neuropsychological testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The APS patients were compared with 60 healthy controls, matched for age, sex, and education, and 25 disease controls (systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE] and rheumatoid arthritis patients who did not have APS). The following observations were made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive deficits were significantly more frequent in the patients with APS (42 versus 18 and 16 percent of the healthy and disease controls, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive dysfunction in the APS patients was associated with the presence of livedo reticularis on physical examination and with the finding of white matter lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No relationship was detected between cognitive dysfunction and previous central nervous system disease (eg, stroke).</p><p/><p>Multifocal white matter lesions on MRI that are suggestive of a vasculopathy are a common finding on MRI in APS patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These lesions may be difficult to distinguish from those in multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p>Other less common neurologic disorders which have been associated with the presence of aPL include epilepsy, psychosis, chorea and hemiballismus, transverse myelopathy, sensorineural hearing loss, orthostatic hypotension, and migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/20,21,47-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21,47-57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematologic abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombocytopenia is frequently observed in APS patients, with an incidence ranging from 22 to 42 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. The frequency of thrombocytopenia is higher in SLE-associated APS than in primary APS. The degree of thrombocytopenia is usually moderate, with a platelet count usually in the range of 100,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">140,000/microL,</span> and is rarely associated with hemorrhagic events. Thrombocytopenia does not preclude the occurrence of thrombotic complications of APS.</p><p>Other hematologic abnormalities reported in patients with APS include autoimmune hemolytic anemia; bone marrow necrosis, especially if there is widespread thrombosis; and various thrombotic microangiopathic syndromes including thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

The mitral valve is most frequently involved, followed by the aortic valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Involvement of the mitral and aortic valves can lead to valvular regurgitation and, rarely, to stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>].

Livedo racemosa, named by Ehrmann in 1907 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>], is a more striking cutaneous finding than livedo reticularis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].

In the majority of these patients, multiorgan involvement was present at the time of diagnosis of APS.</p><p>It is often difficult to distinguish CAPS from other conditions which can lead to multiple organ thrombosis due to overlapping features. While a comprehensive differential diagnosis for CAPS is beyond the scope of this topic, a few major causes of multiple organ thromboses to consider include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>DIC</strong> &ndash; Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a systemic condition involving widespread activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis that may occur in the setting of sepsis or malignancy. Like catastrophic APS, DIC may be associated with laboratory features such as elevated fibrin degradation products, depressed fibrinogen levels, or elevated D-dimer concentrations. Unlike catastrophic APS, DIC is always associated with an underlying systemic disorder, DIC is more likely to be associated with bleeding, and in acute DIC the prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) are prolonged. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HIT</strong> &ndash; Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune-mediated thrombocytopenia that occurs in the setting of heparin exposure. In HIT, heparin-induced antibodies can cause platelet activation leading to potentially fatal arterial and venous thromboses. Like catastrophic APS, HIT can cause moderate thrombocytopenia and thromboses in various organs. Unlike catastrophic APS, HIT almost always occurs in the setting of heparin exposure with a clear temporal relationship, and HIT is not associated with aPL. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>TMA</strong> &ndash; Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) are systemic syndromes (acquired or inherited) in which small vessel platelet microthrombi form in various vascular beds, leading to thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), and organ injury that may be life-threatening. Like catastrophic APS, TMAs may present with unexplained severe thrombocytopenia and organ involvement. Unlike catastrophic APS, TMAs typically do not cause large vessel thromboses, and many of the TMAs are associated with specific laboratory abnormalities related to their underlying pathophysiology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with suspected TTP, HUS, or other thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Catastrophic APS is frequently fatal, with a reported mortality rate approaching 50 percent despite anticoagulant and immunosuppressive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].

A large, multicenter, prospective study of 1,000 APS patients found a decreased survival rate of 90.7 percent at 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The main causes of death during the 10-year follow-up included thrombosis (31 percent), sepsis (27 percent), malignancy (14 percent), hemorrhage (11 percent), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) involvement (8 percent), and catastrophic APS (5 percent). The mean age at death was 59, with a standard deviation of 14 years. There were no differences in the mortality rates in the presence of underlying disease: 6.8 percent of patients with SLE-associated APS compared with 7.1 percent of patients with primary APS died.</p><p>The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in the serum of patients with SLE has been identified as an independent risk factor for premature death. This was illustrated in an observational study of 667 patients with SLE, 49 of whom died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. There was an increased risk of premature death in patients with aPL, thrombocytopenia, and arterial occlusion. Other factors associated with premature death were the intensity of anticoagulation treatment, renal involvement, pleuritis, and disease activity.</p><p>Although some of the risk of early death is due to the increased propensity to thromboembolic disease, in some settings, the presence of aPL may be a marker for a higher mortality rate that is not due to thrombophilia per se. As an example, in a study of 300 consecutive patients with a first ischemic stroke, stroke victims with elevated levels of aPL (immunoglobulin G [IgG] anticardiolipin antibodies [aCL] &gt;20 units) had a higher mortality rate during approximately two years of follow-up than those with lower or absent aCL levels (33 versus 18 percent mortality, relative risk [RR] 1.94, 95% CI 1.05-3.67) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. However, the increased mortality was not due to recurrent stroke but was associated with other characteristics of those with aPL, including a higher rate of malignancy and more prevalent risk factors for coronary heart disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2686937936\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
