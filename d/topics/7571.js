The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ that is tucked under the liver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F68129\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68129 \">figure 1</a>). The gallbladder stores bile, a fluid that is made in the liver and helps the body break down fat.</p><p>Most people with gallbladder cancer have or have had another gallbladder condition called &quot;gallstones.&quot; Gallstones are small stones that form inside the gallbladder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8182486\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of gallbladder cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early on, gallbladder cancer might not cause any symptoms. In many cases, gallbladder cancer is found unexpectedly when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A doctor takes out the gallbladder to treat symptoms that are thought to be caused by gallstones. (Gallstones can cause symptoms similar to those of gallbladder cancer.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A doctor does imaging tests of the belly for another reason. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p>When gallbladder cancer causes symptoms, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain, especially in the upper right side or upper middle part of the belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of appetite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jaundice, which is when the skin and white part of the eye turn yellow</p><p/><p>All of these symptoms can also be caused by conditions that are not gallbladder cancer. But if you have these symptoms, tell your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8182501\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for gallbladder cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check for gallbladder cancer, your doctor will do an imaging test. Imaging tests can include an ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI scan.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8182516\"><span class=\"h1\">What is cancer staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer staging is a way in which doctors find out if a cancer has spread past the layer of tissue where it began, and, if so, how far.</p><p>The right treatment for you will depend a lot on the stage of your gallbladder cancer and your other medical problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8182531\"><span class=\"h1\">How is gallbladder cancer treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gallbladder cancer is usually treated with one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells.</p><p/><p>Gallbladder cancer can sometimes be cured with treatment. This is most likely when the cancer is found at an early stage. But, often, gallbladder cancer is not found at an early stage. If your gallbladder cancer cannot be cured, your doctor can do other treatments to help with your pain, jaundice, or other symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8182546\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor will check you every so often to see if the cancer comes back. Follow-up tests usually include imaging tests.</p><p>You should also watch for the symptoms listed above. Having those symptoms could mean your gallbladder cancer has come back. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8182561\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if my gallbladder cancer comes back or spreads?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your gallbladder cancer comes back or spreads, you might have more radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or both.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8182576\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for gallbladder cancer involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have. Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8182591\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallstones-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Gallstones (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-removal-cholecystectomy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=jaundice-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Jaundice in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-your-cancer-treatment-makes-you-tired-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When your cancer treatment makes you tired (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-loss-of-appetite-and-weight-loss-with-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing loss of appetite and weight loss with cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-with-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting with cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hair-loss-from-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hair loss from cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-care-during-advanced-illness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medical care during advanced illness (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallstones-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Gallstones (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
