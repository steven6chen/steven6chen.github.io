In reproductive age women, the corpus is much larger than the cervix while, during the prepubertal and postmenopausal stages, they are of similar sizes. However, the size of the uterus can vary considerably, depending upon hormonal levels, previous parturition, or the presence of uterine pathology (eg, fibroids, adenomyosis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80897\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80897 \">picture 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H821891\"><span class=\"h3\">Uterine corpus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The corpus, or body, of the uterus has an inverted triangular shape (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82997\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82997 \">figure 3</a>). The most superior portion is called the fundus and the most inferior portion that is continuous with the cervix is called the isthmus, or the lower uterine segment. There are no anatomic landmarks that divide these portions from the rest of the uterine corpus. The uterus is made up of three layers: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometrium &ndash; The endometrium is the lining of the uterine cavity, with a superficial layer that consists of glandular epithelium and stroma. The thickness of the endometrium changes with the menstrual cycle or other hormonal stimulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-the-normal-menstrual-cycle\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of the normal menstrual cycle&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myometrium &ndash; The myometrium is the thickest layer of the uterus. It is composed of smooth muscle fibers that are oriented diagonally and crisscross with fibers from the contralateral side of the uterus. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serosa &ndash; The serosa is the thin outer lining layer of the uterus, investing the body of the uterus, consisting of visceral peritoneum. </p><p/><p>Congenital anomalies of the uterus are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of congenital anomalies of the uterus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25506237\"><span class=\"h3\">Uterine cervix</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cervix is a tubular structure that serves as the conduit between the endometrial cavity and the vagina. The superior portion is continuous with the uterus. During surgery, the junction between the uterine corpus and cervix can be located by palpating the area to feel the superior border of the cervix, which is tubular and bulky compared with the uterus. </p><p>The inferior portion of the cervix protrudes into the vagina. In some women (eg, postmenopausal, following pelvic radiation), the cervix may appear flush with the vagina on examination rather than protruding. </p><p>The cervical canal opens into the endometrial cavity at the internal os and into the vagina at the external os. The ectocervix is the surface of the cervix that protrudes into the vagina.</p><p>The cervix is composed of dense fibrous connective tissue with a minimal amount of smooth muscle located on the periphery that forms a continuous layer between the myometrium and the muscle in the vaginal wall. </p><p>The endocervical canal is lined with glandular epithelium. This transforms into stratified squamous epithelium on the ectocervix due to exposure to the acidic environment that is present in the vagina after menarche. The area where the epithelium changes from glandular to squamous is known as the transformation zone and is the area of the cervix that is most susceptible to dysplasia and malignant transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-female-pelvic-anatomy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The anterior cervix is apposed to the bladder, while the lateral aspects of the cervix are covered by the broad ligament. The posterior aspect of the cervix forms part of the anterior boundary of the pelvic posterior cul-de-sac (pouch of Douglas).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H821942\"><span class=\"h3\">Uterine support structures</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16592485\"><span class=\"h4\">Uterosacral and cardinal ligament complex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">uterosacral/cardinal</span> ligament complex suspends the uterus and upper vagina in its normal orientation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-female-pelvic-anatomy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It serves to maintain vaginal length and keep the vaginal axis nearly horizontal in a standing woman so that it can be supported by the levator plate. Loss of this support contributes to prolapse of the uterus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vaginal apex. </p><p>The cardinal ligaments are condensations of connective tissue that are several centimeters in width and run from the cervix and upper vagina to the pelvic sidewall. The uterine vessels run for much of their course within the cardinal ligaments. </p><p>The uterosacral ligaments are bands of connective tissue that are fused with the cardinal ligaments at their point of insertion in the cervix. The uterosacral ligaments pass posteriorly and inferiorly to attach to the ischial spine and sacrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-female-pelvic-anatomy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25506251\"><span class=\"h4\">Round ligaments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The round ligaments are extensions of the uterine musculature. They begin at the uterine fundus anterior and inferior to the fallopian tubes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83000\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83000 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63463\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63463 \">figure 4</a>), travel retroperitoneally through the layers of the broad ligament, then enter the inguinal canal, and terminate in the labia majora. The male homolog of the round ligaments is the gubernaculum testis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16592458\"><span class=\"h4\">Broad ligament</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The broad ligament covers the lateral uterine corpus and upper cervix. The boundaries of the broad ligament are: superiorly, the round ligaments; posteriorly, the infundibulopelvic ligaments; and inferiorly, the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments. It consists of anterior and posterior leaves that separate to enclose viscera and blood vessels. Structures within the broad ligament are considered retroperitoneal. Dissection between these leaves is necessary to provide exposure of these structures. </p><p>Various portions of the broad ligament are named for nearby structures, ie, the mesosalpinx (located near the fallopian tubes) and the mesovarium (located near the ovary). </p><p>The broad ligament is composed of visceral and parietal peritoneum that contains smooth muscle and connective tissue. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H821997\"><span class=\"h4\">Endopelvic fascia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pelvic viscera are covered by endopelvic fascia, a connective tissue layer that provides support to the pelvic organs, yet allows for their mobility to permit storage of urine and stool, coitus, parturition, and defecation. </p><p>Histologically, endopelvic fascia is composed of collagen, elastin, adipose tissue, nerves, vessels, lymph channels, and smooth muscle. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25506258\"><span class=\"h2\">Adnexa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The uterine adnexa consist of the ovaries and fallopian tubes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25506272\"><span class=\"h3\">Ovary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ovaries are suspended lateral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> posterior to the uterus, depending upon the position of the patient. The supporting structures of the ovaries include the utero-ovarian ligament that attaches the ovary to the uterus; the infundibulopelvic ligament (also referred to as the suspensory ligament of the ovary), through which the ovarian vessels travel, that attaches the ovary to the pelvic sidewall; and the broad ligament, which condenses to form the mesovarium. It is also attached to the broad ligament through the mesovarium. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During hysterectomy, if the ovaries are conserved, the utero-ovarian ligament is transected. If salpingo-oophorectomy is performed, the infundibulopelvic ligaments (with the ovarian vessels) are ligated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63463\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63463 \">figure 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-hysterectomy#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal hysterectomy&quot;, section on 'Adnexal conservation or removal'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The ovary consists of an outer cortex, where the ova and follicles are located, and medulla, where the blood vessels and connective tissue compose a fibromuscular tissue layer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77045 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H346987\"><span class=\"h3\">Fallopian tube</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fallopian tubes arise from the uterine corpus posterior and superior to the round ligaments. The broad ligaments support the tubes with a condensation of connective tissue called the mesosalpinx. Paratubal cysts may develop within the mesosalpinx; these are often remnants of the mesonephric or paramesonephric ducts that form and then resorb during embryologic development. The lumen of the fallopian tubes communicates with the uterine cavity and the intraabdominal cavity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-the-adnexal-mass#H3404015882\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of the adnexal mass&quot;, section on 'Paraovarian/paratubal cysts and tubal and broad ligament neoplasms'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Each tube is divided into four distinct portions: the interstitial portion, where the tube passes through the uterine cornu; the isthmus, with a narrow lumen and thick muscular wall; the ampulla, with a larger lumen and mucosal folds; and the fimbria, located at the end of the tube with frond-like projections that increase the surface area of the end of the tubes, thereby facilitating contact with ovulated ova (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55921\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55921 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p>The fallopian tubes consist of an outer muscularis layer of the tube with longitudinal smooth muscle fibers and an inner layer with circular fibers. The fallopian tube mucosa is composed of numerous delicate papillary folds (plica) consisting of three cell types: ciliated columnar cells; nonciliated, columnar secretory cells; and intercalated cells, which may simply represent inactive secretory cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-female-pelvic-anatomy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25506286\"><span class=\"h1\">VASCULATURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The aorta provides the blood supply to the pelvic structures. The aorta bifurcates at approximately vertebrae L4 to L5 into the right and left common iliac arteries. </p><p>The inferior vena cava, where the right and common iliac veins return their blood flow, is located to the right of the aortic bifurcation. Compression of these veins while packing the bowels during abdominal surgery may cause the patient's blood pressure to drop because of the decreased venous return. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25506293\"><span class=\"h2\">Common and external iliac vessels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The common iliac arteries divide into the external iliac and internal iliac arteries; the internal iliac artery is also referred to as the hypogastric artery. The left common iliac vein travels anterior to the sacrum and medial to the aortic bifurcation and joins the right common iliac vein to form the vena cava posterior to the right common iliac artery. &#160;</p><p>The external iliac artery is located medial to the psoas muscle; it continues its course inferiorly to ultimately become the femoral artery. In the pelvis, the external artery gives off several branches, including: inferior epigastric artery; recurrent obturator artery; and superior vesical artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83008\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83008 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-female-pelvic-anatomy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>The external iliac vein is much larger and lies posterior and medial to the artery. The external iliac vein also covers the obturator fossa, where the obturator neurovascular bundle and lymph nodes are located medial to the obturator internus muscle.</p><p>The umbilicus is the location on the abdominal wall with the shortest distance from skin to peritoneum. Therefore, it is commonly used as the entry point for the first trocar insertion during laparoscopy. The bifurcation of the aorta can be located directly underneath the umbilicus with those with a normal body mass index, to 3 to 4 cm caudal to the umbilicus in the obese patient.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During laparoscopy, in the thin patient, placement of the initial umbilical trocar or Veress needle should be performed at a 30 to 45 degree angle to the anterior abdominal wall in order to avoid injury to the common iliac vessels or the aorta. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-laparoscopic-surgery#H2218431144\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Major vessels'</a>.)</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25506300\"><span class=\"h2\">Inferior and superficial epigastric vessels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The inferior epigastric vessels perfuse the rectus abdominis muscles. The inferior epigastric artery originates from the external iliac artery, travels through the transversalis fascia into a space between the rectus muscle and posterior sheath (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81343\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81343 \">figure 7</a>). In their course from the lateral position of the external iliac vessels, the inferior epigastric artery and vein run obliquely toward a more medial location as they approach the umbilicus. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a muscle-splitting technique is used during laparotomy (eg, Maylard), care must be taken to ensure hemostasis of the inferior epigastric vessels, which may retract quickly when the muscle is transected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incisions-for-open-abdominal-surgery#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incisions for open abdominal surgery&quot;, section on 'Maylard's incision'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The superficial epigastric vessels perfuse the anterior abdominal wall. These vessels run from the femoral vessels and branch extensively as they approach the umbilicus. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When lower abdominal lateral ports are placed during laparoscopy, the inferior and superficial epigastric vessels should be identified to avoid vascular injury. The superficial epigastric vessels can be seen by transilluminating the anterior abdominal wall, with the exception of some obese patients. The inferior epigastric vessels must be visualized intra-abdominally where they run lateral to the medial umbilical ligaments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83000\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83000 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-female-pelvic-anatomy/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-of-the-abdominal-wall\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy of the abdominal wall&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25506307\"><span class=\"h2\">Anterior and posterior divisions of the internal iliac artery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The internal iliac artery (hypogastric artery) branches into the anterior and posterior divisions. </p><p>The posterior division travels toward the ischial spine, branching into the lateral sacral, iliolumbar, and superior gluteal arteries. The anterior division of the internal iliac artery branches into the obliterated umbilical, uterine, superior vesical, obturator, vaginal, and inferior gluteal and internal pudendal arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83008\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83008 \">figure 6</a>). The internal iliac vein lies medial to the internal iliac artery, while the other veins travel with their corresponding arteries.</p><p>The internal iliac artery is a retroperitoneal structure and to identify and access any of its branches of interior iliac artery, a retroperitoneal dissection must be performed. In addition, the ureter runs retroperitoneally in this region, and should be identified prior to the vessel desiccation or ligation of any vessel. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ligation of the hypogastric artery is a useful surgical technique to control massive pelvic hemorrhage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83009\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83009 \">figure 8</a>). Following hypogastric artery ligation, collateral flow from the aortic branches (ie, lumbar and middle sacral artery) or through the inferior mesenteric branches (ie, superior hemorrhoidal vessels) prevents ischemia of the pelvic organs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hemorrhage-in-gynecologic-surgery#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hemorrhage in gynecologic surgery&quot;, section on 'Internal iliac artery ligation'</a>.)</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25506314\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood supply to the uterus, tubes, and ovaries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of the blood supply to the uterus, tubes, and ovaries derives from the uterine arteries and the ovarian arteries. </p><p>The uterine arteries originate from the anterior division of the internal iliac arteries in the retroperitoneum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58377\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58377 \">picture 3</a>). They may share a common origin with the obliterated umbilical artery, internal pudendal, or vaginal artery. In the fetus, the pattern of oxygen delivery through the umbilical artery and vein is reversed from the usual pattern. The umbilical artery carries waste, carbon dioxide, and deoxygenated blood away from the fetus; the umbilical vein delivers oxygenated blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-female-pelvic-anatomy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. &#160; </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The obliterated umbilical arteries (also referred to as the medial umbilical ligaments) can serve as a useful landmark during laparotomy or laparoscopy, since tugging on the obliterated umbilical artery can help identify the uterine artery in cases of distorted pelvic anatomy. </p><p/><p>The uterine artery travels through the cardinal ligament and passes over the ureter, which is located approximately 1.5 cm lateral to the cervix. It then joins the uterus near the level of the internal cervical os and gives off branches that run superiorly towards the uterine corpus and inferiorly towards the cervix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54737\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54737 \">figure 9</a>). The uterine corpus branches anastomose with vessels that derive from the ovarian arteries, thus providing collateral blood flow. &#160;</p><p>The uterine artery also sends a branch to the cervicovaginal junction at the lateral aspect of the vagina. The vagina also receives its blood supply from this uterine branch, as well as from a vaginal branch of the internal iliac artery, which anastomose along the vagina laterally at the 3 o&rsquo;clock and 9 o'clock positions. </p><p>The ovarian arteries arise from the abdominal aorta. The right ovarian vein returns to the inferior vena cava while the left ovarian vein returns to the left renal vein. The ovarian vessels travel through the infundibulopelvic ligaments in close proximity to the ureter, along the medial aspect of the psoas muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83002\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83002 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83005\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83005 \">picture 5</a>). &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25506321\"><span class=\"h1\">LYMPHATICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lymphatic drainage follows the pelvic vessels, with the nodes located anterior, posterior, or lateral to the vessels. The pelvic lymphatic system is located retroperitoneally, like the pelvic vasculature. The pelvic lymphatics include the common iliac, external iliac, internal iliac, medial sacral, and pararectal lymph nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83003\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83003 \">figure 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75242\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75242 \">figure 11</a>). </p><p>The medial sacral lymph nodes run along the middle sacral artery in the presacral space, while the pararectal nodes drain the sigmoid colon; these lymph node chains are usually not involved in gynecologic disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pelvic lymph node dissection, the anatomic boundaries are: the ureter medially; the body of the psoas muscle and genitofemoral nerve laterally; the mid-portion of the common iliac artery (2 cm above the bifurcation) superiorly to the deep circumflex iliac vein inferiorly; and posteriorly, the obturator nerve at the base of the obturator fossa. The nodal tissue from the distal one-half of each common iliac artery should be removed. The nodal tissue from the anterior and medial aspect of the proximal half of the external iliac artery and vein should be excised, as well as the distal portion of the obturator fat pad.</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H483337\"><span class=\"h2\">Obturator lymph nodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The obturator lymph nodes are located in the obturator fossa, medial to the external iliac vessels and lateral to the obliterated umbilical ligament. The obturator nodes can be located by identifying the obturator nerve, which is usually the most easily visualized component of the obturator neurovascular bundle as it enters the obturator canal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H483345\"><span class=\"h2\">Internal iliac lymph nodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The internal iliac lymph nodes are located along the internal iliac vessels and are most numerous in the lateral pelvic sidewalls.

The superior hypogastric plexus receives sympathetic input from the thoracic and lumbar splanchnic nerves and afferent pain input from the pelvic viscera.

These nerves connect to the inferior hypogastric plexus. </p><p>The inferior hypogastric plexus is located lateral to the pelvic viscera and consists of three areas: the vesical plexus, uterovaginal plexus, and the middle rectal plexus. The uterovaginal plexus lies on the medial side of the uterine vessels, lateral to the attachment of the uterosacral ligaments to the uterus, and continues cephalad along the uterus and caudally along the vagina. The caudal fibers innervate the vulvar vestibule and clitoris, and travel in the parametrial tissue lateral to the uterine artery and uterosacral and cardinal ligaments, but within the tissue that is taken during a radical hysterectomy.

Therefore, pelvic surgeons should have a comprehensive knowledge of lower urinary tract anatomy to avoid injury to these structures. </p><p>The lower urinary tract includes the urethra, bladder, and distal ureters. The anatomy of these structures is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-female-urogenital-anatomy#H574323\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical female urogenital anatomy&quot;, section on 'Lower urinary tract'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25506405\"><span class=\"h1\">SIGMOID COLON, RECTUM, AND ANUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sigmoid colon descends into the pelvis curving from the left (descending) colon slightly to the left of the midline and sacrum and is extraperitoneal (located within the peritoneal cavity), unlike much of the colon, which is retroperitoneal. Its blood supply derives from the sigmoid arteries, branches of the inferior mesenteric artery. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sigmoid colon is attached to a distinct mesentery in its mid-portion, which can be traumatized during packing of the bowel out of the pelvis and cause bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are often physiologic attachments of the sigmoid colon epiploicae to the left pelvic sidewall that may need to be dissected in order to adequately visualize the left infundibulopelvic ligament or left ureter at the time of left salpingo-oophorectomy. During this dissection, care should be taken to avoid injury to the genitofemoral nerve, which runs on the surface of the psoas muscle. (See <a href=\"#H347075\" class=\"local\">'Lumbosacral plexus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Once the sigmoid colon has descended into the pelvis, its course straightens and it enters the retroperitoneum at the pelvic posterior cul-de-sac and becomes the rectum. It then expands into the rectal ampulla, an area of stool storage, then bends downwards to almost a 90-degree angle to become the anus. The rectum and anus rest on the sacrum and levator ani muscles and the vagina lies anterior to the rectum. </p><p>The blood supply to the rectum and anus consists of an anastomotic arcade of vessels from the superior rectal (hemorrhoidal) branch of the inferior mesenteric artery, and the middle and inferior rectal (hemorrhoidal) branches of the internal pudendal artery. </p><p>Anal continence is maintained by a series of anal valves. The anus is surrounded by the internal anal sphincter and external anal sphincter. The internal anal sphincter consists of a thicker layer of the circular involuntary smooth muscle fibers, which provides 80 percent of the resting tone of the sphincter, while the external anal sphincter consists of skeletal muscle fibers and is attached to the coccyx. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25506412\"><span class=\"h1\">AVASCULAR PLANES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pelvis contains several potential spaces and connective tissue planes that allow the urinary, reproductive, and gastrointestinal systems to function independently of each other. They lack blood vessels and nerves and are filled with loose areolar tissue, allowing blunt dissection without disruption of these structures. Within these spaces, connective tissue septa form compartments that limit the spread of infection or hematomas.</p><p>Knowledge of these spaces is fundamental for most major pelvic surgery. Familiarity with these avascular spaces, as well as their relationships to each other, helps to avoid injury to the viscera and vasculature, restore normal anatomic relationships in the case of distorted anatomy, perform pelvic reconstruction, and resect pelvic pathology (eg, endometriosis, cancer). </p><p>The avascular spaces of the female pelvis include the vesicovaginal, paravesical, pararectal, rectovaginal, and presacral spaces (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83011\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83011 \">figure 13</a>). There are also potential spaces within the pelvis: the anterior and posterior cul-de-sacs, and the retropubic space (space of Retzius).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25506419\"><span class=\"h2\">Anterior and posterior cul-de-sacs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anterior and posterior pelvic cul-de-sacs separate the uterus from the bladder and rectum, respectively. The anterior cul-de-sac is also known as the vesicouterine pouch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82998\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82998 \">figure 1</a>), and is the space between the dome of the bladder and the anterior surface of the uterus. The peritoneum overlying the dome of the bladder is loose and allows the bladder to expand. This loose peritoneal fold is called the vesicouterine fold.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During abdominal hysterectomy, the vesicouterine fold is dissected to create the bladder flap, access the vesicovaginal space, and dissect the bladder off the lower uterine segment and anterior cervix. </p><p/><p>The posterior cul-de-sac (also referred to as the rectouterine pouch or pouch of Douglas) is the space between the uterus and rectum. Its borders are the vagina anteriorly, the rectosigmoid colon posteriorly, and the uterosacral ligaments laterally. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13558866\"><span class=\"h2\">Vesicovaginal space</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vesicovaginal space is located in the midline. Its boundaries are the bladder anteriorly, the bladder pillars laterally, and the vaginal adventitia laterally. The bladder pillars are composed of connective tissue and blood vessels, specifically the veins from the vesical plexus and the ureter, some cervical branches of the uterine artery anteriorly into the sides of the bladder base, and some extensions of the stronger connective tissue portions of the cardinal ligament. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During abdominal hysterectomy, to dissect the bladder off the lower uterine segment and anterior cervix, sharp dissection in the midline between the bladder pillars will reveal a loose areolar avascular layer when in the proper plane. Veering laterally can result in bleeding from the bladder pillars and obscure visualization during this dissection. </p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25506426\"><span class=\"h2\">Retropubic space</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The retropubic space, also called the space of Retzius, is a potential space between the bladder and the pubic bone. It is bounded by the pubic bone, the peritoneum and muscles of the anterior abdominal wall. Its lateral borders are the arcus tendineus fascia pelvis and the ischial spines. </p><p>Within the retropubic space lie the dorsal clitoral neurovascular bundle, located in the midline, and the obturator neurovascular bundle, located laterally as it enters the obturator canal. In some women, an accessory obturator artery arises from the external iliac artery and runs along the pubic bone. The space lateral to the bladder neck and urethra contains nerves innervating the bladder and urethra, as well as a venous plexus (venous plexus of Santorini) that can ooze with the placement of sutures (ie, while performing a Burch retropubic colposuspension). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sutures for a Burch procedure are anchored into the iliopectineal line, or Cooper's ligament, which runs along the superior border of the ischiopubic rami bilaterally. </p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25506440\"><span class=\"h2\">Paravesical space</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The paravesical spaces are paired spaces that lie anterior to the cardinal ligaments. Their boundaries are the bladder pillars medially, the obturator internus and levator ani muscles and the pelvic sidewalls laterally, and the medial umbilical ligaments superiorly. This space is located within the space of Retzius, or the retropubic space.</p><p>During laparotomy, entry into this space entails dissection close to the pubic bone, avoiding the midline dorsal clitoral neurovascular bundle. During a laparoscopic procedure, retrograde filling the bladder and noting the location of the median and medial umbilical ligaments can aid in identifying the borders of the bladder. The median umbilical ligament can then be grasped with downward traction and transected with monopolar cautery in order to enter the retropubic space. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The paravesical space is most commonly accessed during Burch retropubic colposuspension or a paravaginal defect repair. However, endometriosis can also infiltrate the paravesical space and may need to be excised. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The paravesical space is also accessed at the time of radical hysterectomy. For cervical cancer, the majority of cervical lymphatic drainage to the pelvic lymph nodes travels through the parametria and adequate central dissection of the parametria with tumor-free margins is essential. Once the round ligament is transected, the surgeon develops the anterior leaf of the broad ligament inferiorly, then turning medially in order to create the bladder flap. The paravesical space can then be developed lateral to the medial umbilical ligament until the levator ani muscle is reached. The anterior cardinal ligament can also be assessed at this point for gross tumor invasion into the parametria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radical-hysterectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radical hysterectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25506447\"><span class=\"h2\">Pararectal space</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pararectal spaces are located on either side of the cardinal ligaments. The borders of the pararectal space are defined anteriorly by the cardinal ligament, medially by the rectum, posteriorly by the sacrum, and laterally by the internal iliac artery or pelvic sidewall.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During laparotomy or laparoscopy, the most likely scenario necessitating access to this space is an obliterated posterior cul-de-sac from endometriosis, where the rectum is adhered to the posterior cervix. In that case, the surgeon must first perform a bilateral ureterolysis of the pelvic ureter and dissect the pararectal space in order to safely dissect the rectovaginal space and the rectum off the posterior cervix and vagina. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-treatment-of-rectovaginal-and-bowel-disease#H47883691\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Treatment of rectovaginal and bowel disease&quot;, section on 'Surgical treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pararectal space is also developed at the time of radical hysterectomy. It is accessed by opening the posterior leaf of the broad ligament cephalad posterolateral to the infundibulopelvic ligament. Retraction of the uterus medially helps expose the pararectal space. The ureter must be identified and the space between the ureter and internal iliac artery developed with careful blunt dissection in order to avoid the small veins in this area. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radical-hysterectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radical hysterectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During sacrospinous ligament suspension, the pararectal space is accessed to identify the sacrospinous ligament. The posterior vaginal epithelium is dissected off the underlying rectum then the pararectal space is entered lateral to the rectum using blunt dissection until the ischial spine is palpated.

Its most cephalad border is the posterior cul-de-sac just inferior to the cervix. It contains loose areolar tissue that can bluntly be dissected. Its lateral boundaries are the rectal pillars, which are fibers from the cardinal-uterosacral ligament complex that connect to the lateral rectum then to the sacrum. They divide the rectovaginal space from the pararectal spaces. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occasionally the surgeon may need to enter the rectovaginal space during a hysterectomy when the patient has altered anatomy due to an obliterated cul-de-sac from endometriosis or due to the presence of a posterior lower uterine segment, broad ligament, or cervical fibroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-female-pelvic-anatomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25506496\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic surgery in women requires a comprehensive knowledge of the pelvic anatomy to safely attain access, maximize exposure, ensure hemostasis, and avoid injury to viscera, blood vessels, and nerves. (See <a href=\"#H25506214\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The uterus includes the uterine corpus and uterine cervix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55921\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55921 \">figure 2</a>). In reproductive age women, the corpus is much larger than the cervix while, during the prepubertal and postmenopausal stages, they are of similar sizes. However, the size of the uterus can vary considerably, depending upon hormonal levels, previous parturition, or the presence of uterine pathology (eg, fibroids, adenomyosis). (See <a href=\"#H25506230\" class=\"local\">'Uterus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Support of the uterus is provided by the <span class=\"nowrap\">uterosacral/cardinal</span> ligament complex, round ligament, and broad ligament. Loss of this support contributes to prolapse of the uterus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vaginal apex. (See <a href=\"#H821942\" class=\"local\">'Uterine support structures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The uterine arteries originate from the anterior division of the internal iliac arteries in the retroperitoneum and travel through the cardinal ligament and pass over the ureter. They then join the uterus near the level of the internal cervical os and give off branches that run superiorly towards the uterine corpus and inferiorly towards the cervix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54737\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54737 \">figure 9</a>). The uterine corpus branches anastomose with vessels that derive from the ovarian arteries, thus providing collateral blood flow. (See <a href=\"#H25506314\" class=\"local\">'Blood supply to the uterus, tubes, and ovaries'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ovarian arteries arise from the abdominal aorta. The right ovarian vein returns to the inferior vena cava while the left ovarian vein returns to the left renal vein. The ovarian vessels travel through the infundibulopelvic ligaments in close proximity to the ureter, along the medial aspect of the psoas muscle. (See <a href=\"#H25506314\" class=\"local\">'Blood supply to the uterus, tubes, and ovaries'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lymphatic drainage follows the pelvic vessels, with the nodes located anterior, posterior, or lateral to the vessels. The pelvic lymphatic system is located retroperitoneally, like the pelvic vasculature. The pelvic lymphatics include the common iliac, external iliac, internal iliac, medial sacral, and pararectal lymph nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F83003\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83003 \">figure 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75242\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75242 \">figure 11</a>).
