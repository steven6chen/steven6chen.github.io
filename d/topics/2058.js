In addition, youth with bipolar disorder usually have recurrent episodes of major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Bipolar disorder severely affects the normal development and psychosocial functioning of the youth and increases the risk for suicide, psychosis, substance abuse and behavioral, academic, social, and legal problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Pediatric bipolar disorder frequently has a variable course with rapid fluctuation in mood symptoms during acute episodes. These factors coupled with developmental issues influencing the clinical picture, the difficulties youth can have verbalizing their emotions, and high rates of comorbid disorders, account for the complexity and controversies in diagnosing children and adolescents with bipolar disorder.</p><p>The prevalence of pediatric bipolar disorder in epidemiologic studies is comparable across different countries, with average rates for bipolar I disorder plus bipolar II disorder of approximately 1 to 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, there may be variability across countries for diagnosing bipolar disorder, particularly the other specified bipolar and related disorder (bipolar disorder not otherwise specified) subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. As an example, a study of hospital discharge rates for pediatric bipolar disorder in the United States and England found that after adjusting for length of stay, the discharge rate was more than 12 times higher in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Pediatricians and other primary care physicians should be alert to symptoms suggesting the possibility of the disorder. Diagnosing bipolar disorder in children and adolescents can be complex and has significant consequences. Unless a primary care physician has experience with pediatric bipolar disorder, patients in whom the disorder is strongly suspected should be evaluated by a child psychiatrist or other mental health specialist skilled in making the diagnosis.</p><p>Assessment of manic, hypomanic, and depressive symptoms in youth requires careful probing and longitudinal assessments. In addition, it is important to ascertain the frequency, intensity, number, and duration (summarized by the acronym &ldquo;FIND&rdquo;) of manic, hypomanic, and depressive mood episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], as well as episodes with mixed features (ie, mood episodes that are accompanied by symptoms of the opposite polarity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Given that lack of insight can be associated with mania or hypomania, it is imperative to obtain information from caregivers or other adults who know the child well in order to accurately assess symptoms and potential change in functioning. The child&rsquo;s chronologic age, intellectual capabilities, and environmental factors need to be taken into account when assessing the level of functional impairment or improvement. </p><p>Certain symptoms, particularly if they appear together and are episodic, should raise the suspicion of pediatric bipolar disorder:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased activity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> silliness above and beyond what is expected for the developmental age of the child and not accounted by the situation, other psychiatric disorders, or medications</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased need for sleep, especially if the child is not tired or sleepy the day after having slept only three to four hours during the night </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inappropriate sexual behaviors without a history of exposure to sexual activity (eg, abuse or videos) </p><p/><p>In addition, the presence of psychosis (eg, hallucinations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delusions) should raise the question of whether the child has bipolar disorder; longitudinal studies indicate that psychotic symptoms in the context of depression are a strong predictor of bipolar disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Mild or transient manic symptoms that do not meet the diagnostic threshold for episodes of mania or hypomania may precede or coexist with an episode of depression and can be a harbinger of eventual bipolar disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Clinicians thus need to probe for a history of <span class=\"nowrap\">manic/hypomanic</span> symptoms in youth presenting with depression.</p><p>Evaluation of children and adolescents for bipolar disorder should include a history and examination for the presence of comorbid mental disorders (eg, anxiety disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), substance use, general medical conditions, suicidal and homicidal ideation and behavior, family psychopathology, and ongoing negative life events (eg, family conflicts and abuse); assessment of psychosocial functioning; and longitudinal observation of the mood symptoms. In some cases, psychometric testing can be useful for children with learning problems. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-evaluation#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific learning disabilities in children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Psychometric tests'</a>.)</p><p>To determine the level of care (eg, hospitalization), clinicians need to assess the severity of mood symptoms; presence of suicidal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> homicidal symptoms, psychosis, substance abuse, and agitation, as well as parental psychopathology; the child&rsquo;s and parents&rsquo; adherence to treatment; and family environment. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H190481588\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment instruments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of mood and other psychiatric symptoms can be facilitated by the use of structured and semi-structured interviews and rating scales.

The General Behavior Inventory (GBI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], the parent version of the YMRS (P-YMRS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and the Child Mania Rating Scale for Parents about their children (CMRS-P) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>] have been shown to be psychometrically sound and useful for the screening of bipolar disorder symptoms in youth, but further studies to evaluate the specificity of these instruments for bipolar disorder are warranted.</p><p>The Children Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a parent-report instrument used to assess general psychopathology, has also been used to screen for bipolar disorder in youths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, this instrument is not specific for assessing mania [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H190481616\"><span class=\"h3\">Mood timelines or diaries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mood timelines or diaries describe the course of a patient&rsquo;s mood symptoms over time. Using school years, birthdays, and holidays as anchor points, timelines and diaries can help assess the onset and course of mood disorders. Timelines use a simple scale showing daily changes in mood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F84011\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef84011 \">form 1</a>). As an example, they can include a scatter line in which 0 represents feeling very sad, 10 excessively happy and 5 is a normal mood. A mood diary can include stressors and doses of medications. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H190481623\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis of bipolar disorder and its subtypes begins by diagnosing the manic or hypomanic episodes that determine the diagnosis of this disorder. In addition, the diagnosis requires that clinicians exclude other relevant psychiatric and general medical conditions that can manifest with symptoms that overlap with those of bipolar disorder. (See <a href=\"#H13360196\" class=\"local\">'Mood episodes'</a> below and <a href=\"#H97761136\" class=\"local\">'Bipolar disorders'</a> below and <a href=\"#H190481693\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>We suggest diagnosing bipolar mood episodes and disorders according to the criteria in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although the diagnostic criteria were not developed or specifically adapted for use in pediatric populations, it is possible to apply the criteria to children and adolescents by accounting for developmental issues. </p><p>A reasonable alternative to DSM-5 is the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD-10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

The most common symptoms included increased energy, irritability, mood lability, distractibility, and goal directed activity (each occurred in approximately 75 percent of patients) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F111706\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111706 \">table 2</a>). The results of the meta-analysis need to be taken with caution because there were methodologic limitations (eg, studies varied in how they diagnosed bipolar disorder), which led to substantial heterogeneity across studies in the rates of most symptoms. </p><p>Another criterion is that the manic symptoms impair psychosocial functioning, necessitate hospitalization, or are accompanied by psychotic features (eg, delusions or hallucinations); in addition, the symptoms are not the direct result of a substance or general medical condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, a typical syndrome of manic symptoms, which emerges during antidepressant treatment (eg, pharmacotherapy or electroconvulsive therapy) and persists beyond the physiologic effect of that treatment, is diagnosed as a manic episode if the full criteria are met. </p><p>These symptoms exist as a collection of concurrent symptoms and behaviors. Although a few investigators disagree, the diagnosis of mania requires that the symptoms occur episodically.

Hypomania is characterized by an abnormally and persistently elevated or irritable mood, as well as increased energy or goal directed activity, lasting at least four consecutive days, for most of the day, nearly every day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. During this period, at least three (if elated mood predominates) or four (if irritable mood predominates) of the additional symptoms that characterize mania must be present. (See <a href=\"#H13360219\" class=\"local\">'Mania'</a> above.)</p><p>The distinction between hypomanic and manic episodes is based upon the intensity and duration of symptoms. Hypomanic symptoms are less severe than manic symptoms, and according to DSM-5, the diagnosis of hypomania requires at least four days of symptoms, whereas mania requires at least seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, psychosocial functioning in hypomania is either mildly impaired or significantly improved, whereas functioning in mania is impaired. If severe, mania may include psychotic features, which usually are mood congruent (eg, having super powers or being the messiah) and may lead to hospitalization; by definition, hypomania does not. </p><p>Another criterion for hypomania is that the symptoms are not the direct result of a substance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, a syndrome of hypomanic symptoms, which emerges during antidepressant treatment (eg, pharmacotherapy or electroconvulsive therapy) and persists beyond the physiologic effect of that treatment, is diagnosed as a hypomanic episode if the full criteria are met. &#160;</p><p>Hypomania may be difficult to diagnose not only because functioning can improve during an episode, but also because the symptoms need to be differentiated from normal mood and behaviors usually observed in youths. </p><p>Whereas manic episodes only occur in bipolar I disorder, hypomanic episodes may occur with bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, or other specified bipolar and related disorder.

Major depressive episodes may occur with bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, or other specified bipolar disorder. (See <a href=\"#H97761136\" class=\"local\">'Bipolar disorders'</a> below.)</p><p>Depressive symptoms may fluctuate more frequently in depressed children compared with adults, and depressed children may be more reactive than depressed adults. Depressed children may not look or feel depressed, but are irritable instead. They can be depressed at school, but feel or look happy when they are with their friends or playing games. To consider diagnosing a major depression in youth, it can be useful to evaluate what percent of the time (eg, in a week) they are depressed. Some investigators have suggested that to consider the depression as significant, depression should occur at least 50 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Additional information about the clinical features and diagnosis of depression is discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H13360196\" class=\"local\">'Mood episodes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bipolar I disorder is diagnosed in patients with one or more manic episodes. Nearly all patients also suffer at least one episode of major depression, and hypomania often occurs as well. (See <a href=\"#H97761106\" class=\"local\">'Bipolar I disorder'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bipolar II disorder is diagnosed in patients with a history of at least one hypomanic episode and at least one major depressive episode, and no history of manic episodes. (See <a href=\"#H97761121\" class=\"local\">'Bipolar II disorder'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cyclothymic disorder is diagnosed in patients with periods of hypomanic symptoms that fall short of meeting criteria for a hypomanic episode and periods of depressive symptoms that fall short of meeting criteria for a major depressive episode. Symptoms recur over a time interval of at least one year, during which patients are symptomatic at least half the time and are not symptom-free for more than two consecutive months.

In addition, bipolar disorder is often accompanied by comorbid disorders. (See <a href=\"#H14016871\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic challenges'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are the conditions most likely to be confused with pediatric bipolar disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F84012\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef84012 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F84018\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef84018 \">table 6</a>). The differential diagnosis of bipolar disorder also includes unipolar major depression, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, substance abuse, medication reactions, and general medical illnesses.
