(The Basics)</div><div><a href=\"authors.htm?path=patient-education\" class=\"contributors-marketing\">Written by the doctors and editors at UpToDate</a></div><div id=\"topicText\"><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H180117585\"><span class=\"h1\">What do imaging tests do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging tests, such as X-rays, create pictures of the inside of the body. Some do this in more detail than others. In the case of low back pain, doctors do imaging tests to try to see the structures inside the back (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56246\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56246 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The most commonly used imaging tests are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>X-rays &ndash; X-rays are good at showing bones and large internal structures. But they are not good at showing problems with &quot;soft tissues.&quot; (Soft tissues include muscles and the rubbery discs found between each of the bones in the spine.) An X-ray can show if you have bones that are broken or out of place, or certain types of tumors or infections. X-rays might be done if back pain is caused by a serious injury, such as a bad fall.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT scans &ndash; CT scans are a special kind of X-ray. They show more detail than X-rays, but also expose you to more radiation and cost more. CT scans can show all the problems that X-rays show, plus some problems with soft tissues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MRIs &ndash; MRIs are created using powerful magnets. They show more detail about soft tissues than CT scans, and they do not involve radiation. Some people can't have MRIs because they have devices implanted in their body that would be affected by the magnet. Plus, MRIs are expensive and people often have to wait to get them.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H180117617\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need imaging if I have low back pain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not.</p><p>When people have severe back pain, they often jump to conclusions and assume something is terribly wrong with their back. The truth is, most cases of back pain &ndash; even severe pain &ndash; are not caused by anything serious. Low back pain usually goes away on its own or with simple treatment.</p><p>If you see the doctor or nurse because of low back pain, do not ask for or expect to get an imaging test right away, unless you have one of the symptoms described below. Most people do not need an imaging test in the first 4 to 6 weeks of low back pain. In most cases, it does not make sense to order the test sooner, because the treatment for most causes of low back pain during those first few weeks is the same no matter what an imaging test might show. Even without an imaging test, your doctor or nurse can learn a lot about your pain by talking with you and doing an exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H180117634\"><span class=\"h1\">How can the doctor or nurse tell what is wrong without an imaging test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have low back pain, your doctor or nurse will do an exam and ask questions, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you have pain in just your back, or does it spread to your buttocks or down your leg?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the pain the same on both sides, or does it affect one side more than the other?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you have numbness, tingling, or weakness anywhere?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the pain get better when you lean forward?</p><p/><p>The results of the exam and your answers to these and other questions will give your doctor or nurse a good idea of what is going on with your back. If you have certain symptoms (discussed below), the doctor or nurse will know that there might be something serious going on and order an imaging test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H180117649\"><span class=\"h1\">Who should have imaging tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who have had pain for 4 to 6 weeks or longer often should have imaging tests to search for the cause. For people with certain symptoms, the doctor or nurse might want to order imaging tests right away. This includes people who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Had a serious accident or injury recently (such as a car crash or a bad fall)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are older</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have back pain along with unexplained fever or weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicines called &quot;immune suppressants&quot; or medicines called &quot;steroids&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have diabetes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a history of cancer (except for skin cancer that isn't melanoma)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use drugs that you inject, such as heroin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have osteoporosis, a condition that weakens bones</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have leg weakness or problems controlling their bowels or bladder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a problem called &quot;foot drop,&quot; which is when you cannot seem to hold your foot up, for example, while walking</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H180117664\"><span class=\"h1\">Why not have an imaging test just to check?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People tend to think of imaging tests as harmless, but they are not harmless. The X-rays doctors use to try to diagnose back pain give as much radiation to your pelvic organs (ovaries or testicles) as you would get from having a chest X-ray every day for more than a year. CT scans expose you to even more radiation.</p><p>MRIs do not expose you to radiation but they still have risks. People who have MRIs (or other imaging tests) are much more likely to have surgery and other invasive treatments than people who do not have imaging tests. That's true even for people who do not need surgery. That's because &quot;abnormal&quot; findings on imaging tests of the back are very common, even in people without back pain. Abnormal findings don't always mean that treatment is needed.</p><p>If your doctor or nurse does not think you need an imaging test for low back pain, trust him or her, or ask why. Back pain can be scary but doctors and nurses see many people with symptoms like yours who improve with time and do not need an imaging test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H180117679\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-back-pain-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low back pain in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=herniated-disc-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Herniated disc (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertebral-compression-fracture-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vertebral compression fracture (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-stenosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Spinal stenosis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-back-pain-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Low back pain in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
