This topic review gives an overview of the technical aspects of flow cytometry and highlights some of its uses in the diagnosis of primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs). Each of these immunodeficiencies is discussed in greater detail separately in specific topic reviews.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNICAL ASPECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A basic flow cytometer consists of five main components: a flow cell (through which cells flow), a laser, optical components, detectors to amplify signals, and an <span class=\"nowrap\">electronics/computer</span> system. With these five components, the flow cytometer is capable of performing instantaneous measurements by passing thousands of cells per second through a laser beam and capturing the emerging light from each cell as it passes through the interrogation point. Any suspended cell or particle ranging from 0.2 to 150 micrometers in size is suitable for analysis. Analyses to determine cellular characteristics, such as size, granularity, viability, and immunophenotyping, are the most common types of studies done.</p><p>Theoretically, any biologic sample can be analyzed by flow cytometry, although peripheral blood is the most common sample analyzed. Depending upon the specific assay, whole blood may be used, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) may be isolated and used for analysis. Bone marrow samples are used during the workup of suspected leukemia. Other biologic sources have been used for flow cytometry, such as cerebral spinal fluid or bronchoalveolar lavage, although the lack of published normals from these biologic sites can make interpretation difficult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunophenotyping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunophenotyping is a technique used to characterize the makeup of cell populations by detecting cellular protein expression. Immunophenotyping uses an antibody specific for the antigen of interest that is conjugated to a fluorescent compound known as a fluorophore or fluorochrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F68067\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68067 \">figure 1</a>). These fluorescent compounds absorb energy from the laser source, causing an electron to be raised to a higher energy level. The excited electron quickly returns to its ground state, emitting the excess energy as a photon of light of a characteristic wavelength that is detected by the flow cytometer. Different fluorochromes are excited by different wavelengths of light and emit light at different wavelengths. Thus, it is possible to simultaneously detect several different antigens on a cell by using lasers of different wavelengths and filters of specific wavelengths to detect the fluorescent emission. As an example, flow cytometers currently in use may have as many as five lasers of different wavelengths. Each laser may be paired with three to four different filters, allowing for an analysis of up to 20 different proteins simultaneously.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Data collection and analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each cell is analyzed by the following parameters as the cell suspension passes through the flow cytometer:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The intensity of the forward scatter (FSC) of light, which is a reflection of cell size.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The intensity of the side scatter (SSC) of light, which is a reflection of cell granularity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The intensity of light emitted by each fluorochrome, which reflects the level of expression of the antigen of interest.</p><p/><p>The results are typically presented by two-dimensional dot plots or one-dimensional histograms. As an example, flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood by FSC (ie, size) and SSC (ie, granularity) yields a characteristic two-dimensional plot that distinguishes different cell populations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72579\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72579 \">figure 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neutrophils are large and highly granular and therefore exhibit high SSC and high FSC signal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monocytes are large but less granular. Thus, they exhibit lower SSC signal but similar FSC signal compared with neutrophils.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphocytes are the smallest and least granular of these cells and therefore exhibit the lowest SSC and FSC signals.</p><p/><p>The level of expression of specific antigens can be examined in each of the populations defined by FSC and SSC profiles when flow cytometry is combined with fluorescent staining using antibodies against these antigens. As an example, when peripheral blood is stained with antibodies to CD15 (a neutrophil antigen) and CD14 (a monocyte antigen), three populations of cells are detected: a population of cells that only express CD15 (neutrophils), a population of cells that only express CD14 (monocytes), and a population of cells that express neither CD15 nor CD14 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F51538\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51538 \">figure 3</a>). The percentage of each of these populations is used together with a complete blood count (CBC) with differential to determine the absolute numbers of the different cell populations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF PRIMARY IMMUNODEFICIENCIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) are a group of disorders, which are usually inherited, that can affect cells of the innate or adaptive immune systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Flow cytometry is an essential tool in the diagnosis of immunodeficiencies. Its use is not limited to PIDs, since this methodology may be used to evaluate the immune system in secondary or acquired immunodeficiencies, such as those that may occur during viral infections (eg, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection), post-bone marrow transplantation, during chemotherapy, and during immunosuppression for systemic autoimmunity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Defects in lymphocyte numbers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete blood count (CBC) with differential is an essential first step in the workup of suspected PIDs, although this test does not determine the different lymphocyte subsets. Flow cytometry enables qualitative and quantitative enumeration of lymphocyte subsets, including CD4- and CD8-positive T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F54176\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54176 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">T cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Markedly diminished numbers of na&iuml;ve T cells, with or without diminished numbers of B and NK cells, are a hallmark of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66983\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66983 \">figure 5</a>). SCID can be divided into several subtypes based upon the cell types that are deficient. As examples, mutations in CD3 subunits, CD45, or interleukin (IL)-7 receptor alpha (IL-7-R-alpha) result in T-B+NK+ SCID. Mutations in the recombinase-activating genes (RAG) or Artemis result in T-B-NK+ SCID. Mutations in adenosine deaminase (ADA) result in T-B-NK- SCID. Mutations in the genes for Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) or the gamma chain of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2-R-gamma) result in T-B+NK-SCID. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-specific-defects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): Specific defects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Flow cytometry using markers specific for T cells (CD3), B cells (CD19), or NK cells (CD56) is the first step in evaluating children with suspected SCID due to clinical manifestations or a failed newborn screen for SCID. It is also important to determine the percentage of na&iuml;ve and memory T cells in infants with suspected SCID. In normal newborns, nearly all of the T cells are na&iuml;ve. However, in some situations such as<em> </em>maternal engraftment of T cells, the numbers of T cells may be normal in the affected infant, but nearly all are memory T cells. CD45RA and CD45RO are the two antigens that distinguish na&iuml;ve from memory T cells, respectively.</p><p>Lymphocyte enumeration is also used to determine T cell counts in children with DiGeorge syndrome, also known as 22q11 deletion syndrome. Analysis of T cell numbers is important because T cell counts correlate with mortality in these individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Affected individuals exhibit varying degrees of defects in the development of the thymus. Most patients with DiGeorge have mild defects in T cell numbers and are not clinically immunodeficient (incomplete DiGeorge syndrome). Rarely, infants may have a complete absence of thymic function (complete DiGeorge syndrome) with a profound reduction in the number of T cells similar to that found in SCID. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;DiGeorge (22q11.2 deletion) syndrome: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Regulatory T cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) is a disorder causing widespread autoimmune manifestations usually beginning soon after birth. Mutations in the forkhead box P3 gene (<em>FOXP3</em>) are the cause of IPEX. Foxp3 is a transcription factor that is crucial to the development, survival, and effector function of regulatory T (Treg) cells, which are essential in maintaining peripheral tolerance, thereby preventing autoimmunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Treg cells account for approximately 5 to 10 percent of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells. Treg cells express high levels of CD25, the high-affinity binding subunit of the IL-2 receptor, and low levels of CD127, the alpha subunit of the IL-7 receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Use of antibodies to CD4, CD25, CD127, and Foxp3 allows for the quantitation of Treg cells in peripheral blood that are usually reduced in patients with IPEX (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F63330\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63330 \">figure 6</a>). The presence of Foxp3-positive cells does not rule out IPEX, since some mutations decrease or abolish Foxp3 function but not protein stability. Sequence analysis of the <em>FOXP3</em> gene should be performed if the clinical history suggests IPEX but Foxp3 positive cells are present on flow cytometry. IPEX-like diseases can also be caused by deficiencies in CD25 or signal transducer and activator of transcription 5b (STAT5b), key signal transduction subunits of the IL-2 receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

Three cell types comprise a GC: B cells, follicular dendritic cells (FDC), and follicular helper T (Tfh) cells. Tfh cells migrate to the follicular region and provide costimulatory signals and cytokines to GC B cells, which then proliferate and undergo SHM and CSR. Tfh are characterized by the expression of the C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (CXCR5, where C = cysteine and X = any amino acid; also called CD185 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F96194\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96194 \">figure 7</a>)), which enables these cells to migrate towards a chemokine cytosine-X-cytosine motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13) gradient secreted by the FDC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Tfh are detected in elevated numbers in patients with systemic autoimmunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Tfh cells are reduced in hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (HIES) due to signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is the most common form of congenital agammaglobulinemia, accounting for approximately 85 percent of patients. Patients with XLA present in early childhood with recurrent infections, particularly with encapsulated bacteria and chronic enteroviral infections. XLA is caused by mutations in the Bruton tyrosine kinase (<em>BTK</em>) gene, leading to a developmental block at the pre-B cell stage of B cell development in the bone marrow that results in near complete deficiency of all mature B cells. B cell enumeration is performed using the pan B cell markers CD19 or CD20. The numbers of B cells are usually profoundly reduced in XLA. Intracellular expression of the BTK protein can be analyzed in monocytes to confirm loss of expression of the BTK protein since patients with XLA typically lack B cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F82104\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82104 \">figure 8</a>). Women who carry the mutated allele express normal numbers of B cells and normal levels of BTK due to nonrandom X-chromosome inactivation, but only approximately 50 percent of their monocytes express BTK. Thus, the percent of monocytes expressing BTK can be used to determine the carrier status in relatives of affected children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

AR agammaglobulinemias are caused by mutations in genes essential for the development of B cells (eg, mu heavy chain, lambda 5). Similar to XLA, the numbers of B cells are usually markedly decreased or absent in AR forms of agammaglobulinemia, but BTK expression is normal.

Unlike CD8 cells, which also exhibit cytotoxicity toward tumors and viruses, NK cells exhibit spontaneous cytotoxicity without a requirement for antigen activation. NK cells express unique cell lineage markers such as CD56, as well as CD16, an Fc receptor that mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Most NK cells do not express CD3, although there is a small population of cells, called NKT cells, that are CD3+CD56+. NK cell deficiencies can occur due to a lack of NK cells (eg, minichromosome maintenance complex component 4 [MCM4] or GATA binding protein 2 [GATA2] deficiency) or a lack of NK function (eg, defects in CD16) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. These patients are susceptible to herpetic viral infections. Defects in perforin and other genes involved in the cytotoxic machinery also lead to defective NK killing, as well as defective CD8 killing. These patients are at risk for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).

Frequently, patients with CVID also have disorders of immune regulation (eg, autoimmune cytopenias, inflammatory bowel disease, interstitial lung disease). The diagnostic criteria for CVID include a low age-adjusted immunoglobulin G (IgG) and a low immunoglobulin A (IgA) or immunoglobulin M (IgM), impaired specific antibody responses following immunization, and exclusion of other causes of hypogammaglobulinemia in a patient greater than two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Monoallelic mutations in the transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand protein interactor (TACI) gene (<em>TNFRSF13B</em>) are a risk factor to develop CVID in a small percentage of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. With the increased use of high-throughput DNA sequencing, an increasing number of monogenic causes of &quot;CVID-like&quot; diseases have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Patients with CVID have been grouped based upon their respective B cell phenotypes as determined by flow cytometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. These classification schemes involve analysis of the maturational state of B cells and other antigens (eg, CD21, CD38), which may help to predict noninfectious complications of CVID, such as splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, or granulomatous disease. B cells go through a maturational program from na&iuml;ve B cells (characterized by the expression of immunoglobulin D [IgD] but lacking the memory marker CD27) to memory B cells (IgD+CD27+) and switched memory B cells (IgD-CD27+) upon antigen exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F52576\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52576 \">figure 9</a>).</p><p>The EUROclass criteria for CVID distinguished patients based upon the extent of B cell lymphopenia (&lt;1 percent B cells), the reduction of switched memory B cells, the expansion of CD21 low B cells, and the expansion of transitional B cells (CD38++IgM++) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F96193\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96193 \">figure 10</a>). Granulomatous disease was associated with a reduction in switched memory B cells, splenomegaly with low switched memory B cells and increased CD21 low B cells, and lymphadenopathy with increased transitional B cells.

Upon activation, T cells proliferate and differentiate into cytokine secreting (CD4) or cytotoxic (CD8) cells. CD4 cells can be further differentiated into different subsets based upon the type of cytokines that they express, such as T helper type 1 (Th1) cells expressing interferon (IFN)-gamma, Th2 cells expressing IL-4, and Th17 cells expressing IL-17. CD4 T cells are also critical for B cell stimulation, which they accomplish through cell surface molecules (eg, CD40L) and cytokines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1370262337\"><span class=\"h3\">SCID or SCID-like illnesses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete loss of T cells results in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), but, in some instances of SCID, there are a significant number of T cells that do not proliferate or function (eg, stromal interaction molecule-1 [STIM1] and Orai1 deficiencies). The workup of these patients requires assessment of the proliferative ability of T cells. Historically, tritiated thymidine incorporation was used to measure the proliferation of T cells, but this can also be accomplished by flow cytometry. One manner to test this is to label cells with a fluorescent molecule, such as carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CSFE), and then activate the cells with T cell mitogens. As cells divide, the amount of fluorescence is reduced in half, which can be measured by flow cytometry. An alternative to this is to use fluorescently labelled thymidine analogs, such as BrdU or EdU, to measure proliferation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperimmunoglobulin M syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperimmunoglobulin M syndrome (HIGM) is characterized by recurrent infections and very low levels of serum IgG, immunoglobulin E (IgE), and IgA, with normal or elevated IgM. The most common form of HIGM is X-linked HIGM (XHIM) syndrome caused by mutations in the CD40 ligand (CD40L, also called CD154) gene. CD40L is transiently expressed upon CD4+ T cell activation, which then interacts with CD40 on B cells, resulting in B cell activation, proliferation, immunoglobulin class switch recombination, and affinity maturation. Surface expression of CD40L on CD4+ T cells can be measured by in vitro activation of peripheral blood by phorbol esters (eg, phorbol 12-myristate 12-acetate [PMA]) and calcium ionophore that induce the expression of CD40L (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F61633\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61633 \">figure 11</a>). The failure to detect CD40L on activated cells is used as a screening flow cytometric assay to diagnose XHIM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In addition, the expression of CD40 on B cells can also be analyzed since defective CD40 expression is known to be one of the causes of autosomal-recessive HIGM (AR-HIGM) syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F61633\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61633 \">figure 11</a>). In a small percentage of cases of XHIM, CD40L is expressed on activated T cells but is unable to bind to CD40. In these instances, functional CD40L-CD40 binding assays can be performed by flow cytometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), also known as Canale-Smith syndrome, is caused by genetic defects in proteins involved in the Fas-mediated apoptotic pathway. ALPS patients present with lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and autoimmune cytopenias and are at high risk of developing lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. ALPS is categorized into Ia, Ib, IIa, IIb subtypes due to gene mutations in <span class=\"nowrap\">Fas/CD95,</span> Fas ligand (FasL), caspase10, and caspase8, respectively. Normally, &lt;1 percent of T cells that express the T cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chains do NOT also express the CD4 or CD8 coreceptors. These cells are called double-negative T cells (DNTs). In ALPS, the number of TCR alpha beta DNTs is increased (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F82246\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82246 \">figure 12</a>).

The defects in HIES are caused by missense mutations in the transcription factor STAT3, which is required to induce CD4+ T cells to produce IL-17a, a cytokine important in the generation of effective immune responses to bacteria and fungi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. These mutations are inherited in an AD manner due to a dominant negative effect of the mutated protein. A flow cytometry-based functional assay that measures the ability of T cells to synthesize IL-17a can be used to screen for this disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F64269\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64269 \">figure 13</a>). In this assay, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are stimulated with phorbol ester (PMA) and calcium ionophore in the presence of molecules (eg, brefeldin A) that prevent exocytosis of IL-17a. After several hours, the cells are stained with an IL-17a specific antibody in the presence of detergents that allow for intracellular staining of IL-17a.

Upon activation of NK cells or CD8+ T cells, cytotoxic granules translocate toward the point of contact with the target cell and fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing the cytotoxic molecules perforin and granzymes into the intercellular space. This process is facilitated by several proteins including Rab27a, Munc13-4, Syntaxin 11, and Lyst1. Perforin then facilitates the delivery of granzymes into the target cell and the initiation of apoptosis. Gene mutations in proteins involved in this process may result in HLH in response to viral infections, particularly cytomegalovirus and EBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Briefly, a target tumor cell line (K562) is labeled with a fluorescent dye (carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester [CFSE]) so that these target cells can be identified from the subject's effector cells. These target cells are incubated with increasing ratios of PBMCs containing NK cells. Upon apoptosis, target cells shrink (reflected by a reduction in cell size) and incorporate the fluorescent dye (7-aminoactinomycin D [7-AAD]), which intercalates into the DNA of apoptotic cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F55165\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55165 \">figure 16</a>). Defective killing of effector cells indicates cytotoxic lymphocyte dysfunction and possible mutation in gene(s) in the cytotoxic pathway described above. Flow cytometry can then be used to analyze the expression of cytotoxic molecules (eg, perforin), as well as determine if there are defects in the degranulation of these cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Expression of cytotoxic molecules and testing for degranulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Defective cytotoxicity is the hallmark of HLH. The expression of perforin as detected by intracellular flow cytometry is an important analysis in evaluating patients with defective cytotoxicity since 20 to 30 percent of HLH patients present with defects in perforin expression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F68336\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68336 \">figure 17</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

These proteins are critical to the translocation and fusion of cytotoxic granules to the plasma membrane. Measurement of surface expression of CD107a (lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 [LAMP-1]) by flow cytometry can be used for assessment of the cytotoxic pathway since this protein is displayed on the cell surface upon cytotoxic granule fusion with the plasma membrane. Normally, approximately 5 to 10 percent of NK cells express CD107a on the cell surface when in contact with the target cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79019\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79019 \">figure 18</a>).

Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1(LAD I) is an AR disorder due to mutations in the beta-2 integrin CD18. LAD II, also an AR disorder, occurs due to mutations in a fucose transporter that causes sialyl Lewis <span class=\"nowrap\">X/CD15a</span> deficiency. Both CD15 and CD18 are involved in the rolling and firm adhesion of neutrophils to endothelium.

CGD is characterized by the absence or severe reduction of the neutrophil oxidative burst that is required to produce molecules, such as superoxide, that are critical to the killing of micro-organisms. In CGD, microbial killing is defective due to mutations in one of four known components of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex. These diseases are X linked <span class=\"nowrap\">(gp91phox/CYBB)</span> or AR <span class=\"nowrap\">(p22phox/CYBA,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">p47phox/NCF1,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">p67phox/NCF2)</span>. Activation of the oxidative burst pathway in neutrophils by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) is G-protein dependent. Thus, this assay is also helpful in evaluating children with a suspected immunodeficiency due to an activating mutation in the gene <em>RAC2</em>, which may present in a similar manner to CGD. In this case, the dihydrorhodamine (DHR) response will be normal when stimulated with PMA but will be absent when stimulated with fMLP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Flow cytometric diagnosis of CGD is made based upon reduced oxidation of the fluorescent dye dihydrorhodamine (DHR123). In this assay, neutrophils are loaded with DHR123, then stimulated with phorbol esters or soluble bacterial peptides (eg, fMLP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F57778\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57778 \">figure 20</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/flow-cytometry-for-the-diagnosis-of-primary-immunodeficiencies/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. A strong shift in fluorescence is typically seen when the neutrophils are activated. This fluorescence is either absent or severely reduced in patients with CGD. This assay can also be used to detect carrier status of female relatives of patients with X-linked CGD since CGD carriers will exhibit a bimodal peak due to random X-inactivation. However, skewed X-inactivation may alter this finding, especially if the carrier has some CGD features.
