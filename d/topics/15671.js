This increase is driven by increased awareness of better outcomes and quality of life provided by home dialysis and by short daily hemodialysis compared with conventional, in-center, three times per week hemodialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-daily-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short daily hemodialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This trend has prompted the development of effective hemodialysis equipment that may be used outside of a dialysis center. Although conventional hemodialysis machines have been used for home dialysis, such machines generally employ a high dialysis flow rate. High flow rates potentially increase water and electrical costs, often mandating home electrical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> plumbing modifications that render the use of such machine impractical for some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-daily-home-hemodialysis-the-low-dialysate-volume-approach/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This topic reviews the requirements for a home hemodialysis machine and the approach used by NxStage to develop an effective dialysis machine for home use.</p><p>Issues relating to patient survival and the technical aspects of home hemodialysis, short daily hemodialysis, and nocturnal hemodialysis are discussed elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-hemodialysis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Home hemodialysis machines'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6764751\"><span class=\"h1\">FREQUENT LOW-VOLUME DIALYSATE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In order to provide effective dialysis with a low-dialysate volume, the dialysate must be nearly saturated with uremic solutes such as urea. One home hemodialysis platform that utilizes such an approach is the NxStage home hemodialysis device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-daily-home-hemodialysis-the-low-dialysate-volume-approach/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Near saturation of dialysate is achieved by maintaining a very low ratio of dialysate flow rate (QD) to blood flow rate (QB); this ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">(QD/QB)</span> is termed the flow fraction by NxStage. Utilizing a low flow fraction is in marked contrast to standard hemodialysis platforms that utilize a nearly unlimited supply of dialysate, which is generally not as saturated with uremic solutes upon leaving the dialyzer. In conventional hemodialysis, urea clearance increases as either blood flow or dialysate flow increases. Although the urea clearance increases as the dialysis flow rate increases, the spent dialysate is less saturated, and, as a result, there is a marked decrease in dialysis efficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65329\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65329 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>By contrast, when a low <span class=\"nowrap\">QD/QB</span> (flow fraction) is utilized, there is much more efficient use of dialysate (urea saturation can theoretically approach 100 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F76066\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76066 \">figure 2</a>), and, therefore, less dialysate can be used. Under these conditions, urea clearance is approximately equal to the dialysate flow rate. Though the optimal ratio of dialysate to blood flow rate that allows maximum efficiency and a minimum amount of dialysate is in the range of 25 to 33 percent, the use of flow fractions of approximately 40 to 50 percent (dialysate urea saturation 90 to 85 percent) can achieve target <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> if the volume of dialysate is appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-daily-home-hemodialysis-the-low-dialysate-volume-approach/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7208640\" class=\"local\">'Target Kt/V'</a> below.)</p><p>A decrease in dialysate flow rate (ie, a lower flow fraction) while maintaining the same volume of dialysate results in an increased time on therapy. Given blood flow rates of 400 to 450 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> typical dialysate flow rates are in the range of 100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>.</p><p>One consequence of maintaining a fixed, low ratio of dialysate to blood flow rate (flow fraction) is that an increase in the prescribed dialysate volume will result in an increased time on dialysis. (See <a href=\"#H7208633\" class=\"local\">'Ultrafiltration'</a> below.)</p><p>Similarly, a decrease in blood flow rate dictates a proportionate decrease in dialysate flow rate, or else dialysate urea saturation and <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> will decrease.</p><p>More importantly, a fixed flow fraction maintains dialysate saturation and delivered <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> regardless of any intradialytic changes in blood flow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7208633\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrafiltration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with conventional hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, ultrafiltration is required in order to maintain euvolemia. The ultrafiltration volume generally does not affect the dialysis time of patients who are dialyzed utilizing standard technology (providing the volume remains within hourly ultrafiltration parameters). The ultrafiltration volume increases the dialysis time of patients using the NxStage System One dialysis device since these machines fix the ratio of QD (fluid leaving <span class=\"nowrap\">dialyzer)/QB</span>. The amount of total ultrafiltrate volume per treatment is added to the total dialysate volume per treatment, which increases the total fluid volume leaving the dialyzer (prescribed dialysate volume plus ultrafiltration volume). Since the flow fraction is fixed (as it is with NxStage), the increased volume requires an increase in the treatment time. In some patients, this provides an incentive to limit fluid intake. For example, to ultrafiltrate an extra liter, it might require another 6 to 10 minutes of treatment time, depending on the flow fraction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7208640\"><span class=\"h2\">Target Kt/V</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urea kinetic modeling has not been validated as a measure of adequate dialysis for more frequent low-volume hemodialysis modalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The best measure of adequacy of more frequent dialysis therapies is unknown, though several have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-daily-home-hemodialysis-the-low-dialysate-volume-approach/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) guidelines and recommendations for target standardized <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> per week are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-daily-hemodialysis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short daily hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Dialysis prescription and dose monitoring'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-daily-hemodialysis#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short daily hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7208647\"><span class=\"h2\">Volume of dialysate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prescribing the appropriate volume of dialysate is conceptually similar to prescribing appropriate dialysate volume in peritoneal dialysis patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis#H1128865437\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate peritoneal dialysis&quot;, section on 'Target Kt/Vurea'</a>.)</p><p>The volume of distribution of urea (V) is estimated to be equal to body water. Larger patients have larger volumes of distribution of urea (V) and therefore require a higher product of clearance X time (Kt) to achieve the target <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span>. The clearance (K) per dialysis session is theoretically adjusted by changing either the volume of dialysate per session or the saturation of urea in the dialysate fluid.</p><p>Among patients undergoing low-volume frequent hemodialysis five days per week, most clinicians target a standardized weekly <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> urea of 2 to 2.1 or a per-treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> urea of approximately 0.6. As an example, a 70 kg male who has a urea volume of distribution of 35 liters (assuming V is 50 percent of body weight in kilograms) would need to use 21 liters of 100 percent saturated dialysate (21 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/35</span> L = 0.6), providing no or only minimal ultrafiltration was required. If <span class=\"nowrap\">QD/QB</span> is in the range of 40 percent, then saturation is approximately 90 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65329\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65329 \">figure 1</a>). Thus, a 70 kg male would need 23.3 liters of fluid to meet the daily <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> goal of 0.<span class=\"nowrap\">6/treatment</span> if there was no ultrafiltration to add to diffusive urea clearance (23.3 L x 0.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> 35 L = 0.6). In hemodialysis, if dialysate saturation is maximized with a low ratio of dialysate to blood flow rate (low flow fraction), then the only way to increase <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> is to increase the volume of dialysate used. If the patient is undergoing frequent low-volume hemodialysis using a system with a fixed ratio, such as NxStage, the dialysate volume is limited. The average dialysate volume used with NxStage therapy is approximately 20 to 30 liters for an adult doing five or six treatments per week. Though initial dialysis prescription is estimated by above calculations, standardized weekly <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> is calculated from measured single-pool <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span>. Approximate initial volume of dialysate determined by weight and range of initial flow fraction is demonstrated in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F116326\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116326 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>If the standard <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> does not meet the target, then the prescription needs to be adjusted to increase Kt, achieved by increasing the volume of dialysate or the percent saturation of dialysate fluid or both. Increasing the amount of dialysate volume or increasing the percent saturation (by decreasing flow fraction) will increase dialysis time, which may negatively impact the burden. However, if the dialysate volume is generously increased (eg, 5 liter increase), then the flow fraction could be simultaneously increased, resulting in a higher Kt, despite lower saturation, and conceivably less time on therapy. The NxStage home dialysis device allows for a maximum dialysate flow rate of 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> and, therefore, the flow fraction cannot be higher than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/blood</span> flow rate. Though a higher flow fraction will produce less saturated dialysate, the time of therapy will decrease for the same blood flow rate and dialysate volume. A NxStage home dialysis device has a maximum dialysate flow rate of 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> thereby decreasing time on therapy. Performing short daily dialysis five days per week requires a significant commitment by the patient and partner. Avoiding unnecessary, long treatments might lessen the burden. However, the cumulative weekly time on short daily hemodialysis should be at least as long as the cumulative weekly time on three times weekly, in-center hemodialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7208654\"><span class=\"h1\">DIALYSATE COMPOSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending on the machine used to deliver the frequent low-volume dialysis treatments, the dialysate fluid is made differently. For the NxStage platform, the dialysate is either generated by a self-contained dialysate generating system (PureFlow SL) or is available as prepackaged &quot;travel fluids&quot; in 5-liter sterile bags (similar to peritoneal dialysis fluids).</p><p>There are limited options for altering the electrolyte content of the dialysate if using the NxStage. The dialysate buffer used is lactate, which generates bicarbonate when metabolized in the liver.</p><p>The composition of dialysate is:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lactate &ndash; 40 or 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potassium &ndash; 1 or 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sodium &ndash; 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcium &ndash; 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnesium &ndash; 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chloride &ndash; 105 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucose &ndash; 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p><p/><p>PureFlow SL generates dialysate in 40-, 50-, or 60-liter batches from prepacked concentrate that must be used within 96 hours of initiation of production. Different options for electrolyte content are not available for every size batch, and compositions change periodically. We contact the dialysis provider or manufacturer for updates on options.</p><p>If using a standard, conventional hemodialysis platform to perform frequent, low-volume hemodialysis, dialysate electrolyte options are similar to those typically available for in-center hemodialysis treatments.</p><p>Marked changes in serum electrolytes do not occur during dialysis among patients using frequent, low-volume hemodialysis, because of the relatively low volume of dialysate used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7208661\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTICOAGULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If using standard center hemodialysis platforms for frequent, low-volume hemodialysis, heparin pumps can be used. NxStage System One does not have a heparin pump. Instead, a single bolus of heparin is used at the initiation of dialysis. A typical dose of heparin for a two- to three-hour treatment is 2000 to 3000 units.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7208668\"><span class=\"h1\">DIALYZER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard center hemodialysis platforms use typical blood lines and dialyzers. NxStage System One utilizes a prepackaged cartridge system that includes dialysate, blood, and saline infusion lines. The cartridge is available with or without a preattached, gamma-sterilized, polyethersulfone dialyzer (membrane area 1.6 m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1155835\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increase in home dialysis has led to the development of effective hemodialysis equipment that may be used outside of a dialysis center. Ideally, a home hemodialysis machine should be portable, easy to use, have minimal storage space requirement, require no electrical or plumbing modification to the home, and be energy and water efficient.
