However, only 15 to 20 percent of patients have potentially resectable disease at diagnosis; approximately 40 percent have distant metastases, and another 30 to 40 percent have locally advanced, unresectable tumors. Typically, patients with locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer have tumor invasion into adjacent critical structures, particularly the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries. The optimal management of these patients is controversial, and there is no internationally-embraced standard approach. Therapeutic options include radiation therapy (RT) alone, chemoradiotherapy, and chemotherapy alone. Rarely, a response to initial therapy will be sufficient to permit an attempt at subsequent resection.</p><p>Others have disease that is categorized as &quot;borderline resectable.&quot; Although the definition is variable (and often dependent upon the individual surgeon), patients with focal tumor abutment of the superior mesenteric artery, encasement of the gastroduodenal artery up to the hepatic artery, or involvement of the superior mesenteric <span class=\"nowrap\">vein/portal</span> vein that is potentially resectable and reconstructable could all fall into this category. While these patients are potentially resectable, the high likelihood of an incomplete resection has prompted interest in strategies to &quot;downstage&quot; the tumor prior to surgical exploration using chemotherapy with and without RT (neoadjuvant therapy).</p><p>This topic review will focus on initial chemotherapy and RT for patients with nonmetastatic, locally advanced, unresectable or borderline resectable, exocrine pancreatic cancer. Management of patients with potentially resectable disease, systemic chemotherapy for patients with metastatic disease, and a compilation of chemotherapy regimens used for treatment of pancreatic cancer are discussed separately.

The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines do not specifically address the definition of &quot;borderline resectable pancreatic cancer,&quot; but they recommend preoperative therapy rather than initial surgery for any patient with no clinical evidence of metastatic disease who has what appears to be potentially resectable pancreatic cancer with a radiographic interface between the primary tumor and mesenteric vasculature on cross-sectional imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Patients with borderline resectable disease differ from those with potentially resectable disease in that they are at a high risk for a positive margin of resection due to tumor artery abutment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]; they require a more complex operation, usually involving vascular resection and reconstruction; and they may be at higher risk of harboring radiographically occult metastatic disease.

However, data from the randomized LAP-07 trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] suggest no survival benefit from chemoradiotherapy as compared with continued systemic chemotherapy alone, at least for patients treated initially with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As a result, chemoradiotherapy cannot be recommended for all patients who do not develop metastatic disease after initial systemic chemotherapy. Our preferred approach is to encourage patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer to enroll in clinical trials testing the contribution of RT to modern combination chemotherapy. If trials are unavailable or patients are ineligible, we suggest treatment with EBRT plus concomitant low-dose infusional FU (eg, 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> daily) for patients who are considered candidates for resection after initial chemotherapy to attempt to increase the R0 resection rate. It is unknown whether RT contributes to a higher resection rate following systemic chemotherapy, particularly if FOLFIRINOX is given, and continued chemotherapy alone to maximal response is an appropriate alternative option in this setting. For patients with truly unresectable disease, we suggest chemotherapy alone rather than chemoradiotherapy, but we would also consider chemoradiotherapy in selected other patients, such as those who can no longer tolerate further chemotherapy, but who continue to have localized disease and maintain a good performance status. These guidelines are consistent with guidelines for treatment of locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer from ASCO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Up to one-third of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer develop overt metastases during the initial phase of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. Given the lack of proof for a survival benefit of initial chemoradiotherapy versus chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced unresectable disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>], it was hypothesized that a period of initial disease control with chemotherapy alone might allow the selection of patients without occult micrometastatic disease who might benefit from RT in terms of both local control and survival. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Concomitant chemoradiotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p>This hypothesis was supported by data from at least three retrospective series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/65,67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,67,68</a>]. As an example, this strategy was evaluated in a retrospective series of 181 patients with locally advanced, unresectable but nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer who had been treated with gemcitabine-based chemotherapy alone as part of phase II and III trials conducted by the European Groupe Cooperateur Multidisciplinaire en Oncologie (GERCOR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. In each protocol, chemotherapy was initially given for three months, and the decision to continue it or administer chemoradiotherapy (55 Gy EBRT with concurrent infusional FU) was left to the discretion of the investigator. Among the 128 patients who did not progress after three months of chemotherapy and who retained an adequate performance status, 72 received chemoradiotherapy, while 56 continued with chemotherapy. When the two groups were compared, chemoradiotherapy was associated with significant improvement in median progression-free survival and overall survival (15 versus 11.7 months).</p><p>However, the efficacy of this approach could not be confirmed in the international LAP07 trial, a randomized 2x2 factorial design study in which 442 patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer and an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 4</a>) were initially randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erlotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erlotinib</a>; at the end of four months, patients without progression were randomly assigned to two additional months of chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (54 Gy EBRT plus concurrent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> 1600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The trial was terminated prematurely after accrual of only 442 of the 820 intended participants when interim analysis revealed that prespecified futility criteria were met. At a median follow-up of 36 months, chemoradiotherapy was not superior to continuing chemotherapy (median overall survival 15.2 versus 16.5 months), and the proportion of patients with a sufficient therapy response to permit later pancreatectomy after the second randomization was not significantly different (eight after chemotherapy alone versus four after chemotherapy plus chemoradiotherapy). Local control was marginally better in the chemoradiotherapy group (locoregional progression in 32 versus 46 percent with chemotherapy alone). The toxicity data did not reveal substantial differences in adverse events for individuals treated with or without chemoradiotherapy, however patient-reported toxicity data were not included. </p><p>There were some issues with RT compliance; only 32 percent of patients in the chemoradiotherapy arm were treated per protocol, while 50 percent had minor deviations, and 18 percent had major deviations.

On the other hand, the contribution of RT to increasing R0 resection rates in patients who appear potentially resectable after initial chemotherapy is unclear, particularly in those treated initially with multidrug chemotherapy regimens with a higher objective response rate, such as FOLFIRINOX.

However, the relative contribution of chemotherapy and RT to these results is unknown. At some institutions, using upfront FOLFIRINOX, chemoradiotherapy is pursued following chemotherapy only in those patients who remain unresectable by radiologic criteria after a maximal response to chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, as noted above, there is increasing evidence that a &quot;response&quot; to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with borderline resectable disease (particularly in those patients treated with initial FOLFIRINOX) is not necessarily reflected by standard radiographic indicators. (See <a href=\"#H114822345\" class=\"local\">'FOLFIRINOX'</a> above.)</p><p>Our approach to neoadjuvant therapy for patients with borderline resectable tumors is similar to that used for locally advanced, unresectable disease and outlined in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91436\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef91436 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of intraoperative RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of randomized trials demonstrating benefit, intraoperative RT (IORT) cannot be considered a standard approach for treatment of borderline resectable pancreatic cancer, and it should be reserved for carefully selected patients who are being treated in a center with significant experience and expertise, preferably within the context of a clinical trial.</p><p>IORT permits the delivery of high-dose RT directly to areas of tumor involvement without the morbidity associated with irradiation of adjacent normal tissues, particularly the small bowel. A number of reports from both single institutions and cooperative groups have explored IORT, usually in conjunction with preoperative chemoradiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/10,131-134\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,131-134</a>]. Taken together, the available data suggest that while local control rates may be higher with IORT compared to EBRT alone, this benefit is offset by the rapid development of metastatic disease in most reports, and it is not clear that IORT contributes to higher survival rates. The benefits of IORT have been marginal or absent in other reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>A systematic review of IORT for treatment of pancreatic cancer included 14 reports published between 1995 and 2007 (the majority case series, no randomized trials) involving patients with either localized resectable or locally advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>]. The authors concluded that, while the use of IORT may be associated with a slight (and statistically nonsignificant) improvement in median survival among patients with localized, potentially resectable pancreatic cancer, no benefit could be shown in the setting of locally advanced disease.

The optimal management of these patients is controversial, and there is no internationally-embraced standard approach. Therapeutic options include radiation therapy (RT) alone, chemoradiotherapy, and chemotherapy alone. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p>Our general approach, which is outlined in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91436\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef91436 \">algorithm 1</a>), is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with locally advanced categorically unresectable disease, we prefer enrollment in clinical trials testing new treatment strategies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If trials are unavailable or patients are ineligible, we suggest an initial period of chemotherapy rather than immediate RT or chemoradiotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). This approach has the advantage of sparing those patients who have rapidly progressive disease in the liver or peritoneum from undergoing RT. (See <a href=\"#H626253\" class=\"local\">'Initial chemotherapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H194631891\" class=\"local\">'Chemoradiotherapy versus chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The optimal regimen has not been established, and enrollment in clinical trials is preferred. If trials are unavailable or patients are ineligible, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> monotherapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60330\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60330 \">table 7</a>) or a gemcitabine-based combination regimen (eg, gemcitabine plus nanoparticle albumin-bound <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> [<a href=\"topic.htm?path=nanoparticle-albumin-bound-paclitaxel-nabpaclitaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nabpaclitaxel</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F89668\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89668 \">table 8</a>)) represents a standard approach. However, for patients with a good performance status, a total bilirubin level that is below 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, a favorable comorbidity profile, and a preference for and support systems to permit aggressive medical therapy, combination chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX (short-term infusional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> [FU] plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=irinotecan-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">irinotecan</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F79571\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79571 \">table 1</a>)) may be preferred.

However, chemoradiotherapy could be considered in selected patients, such as those who can no longer tolerate further chemotherapy, but who continue to have localized disease and maintain a good performance status. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Chemoradiotherapy after initial chemotherapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If resection is being considered, we continue to suggest combined treatment with external beam RT (EBRT) plus concomitant low-dose infusional FU (eg, 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> daily) in an attempt to increase the complete (R0) resection rate (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">For patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy, we suggest the substitution of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> (or, where available, S-1) for infusional FU in patients for whom ambulatory infusional therapy using a pump is not considered feasible (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Oral fluoropyrimidines as a substitute for infusional FU'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">There is little evidence to support better outcomes in patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer with concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> as compared with concurrent daily infusional FU (the usual regimen) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a>, and we suggest not using gemcitabine as an alternative radiation sensitizer to a fluoropyrimidine during chemoradiotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Another alternative to chemoradiotherapy is continued chemotherapy alone to maximal response. It is unknown whether RT contributes to a higher resection rate following systemic chemotherapy, particularly if FOLFIRINOX is given. Nevertheless, this approach is consistent with published guidelines form the <a href=\"https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=Uq9WYRsg9p/PSM9vt3rBGtHa7uSejixwk2tJVlS5LMeu0awaX/Er3fekhDozpt3zew+Yt0LRtO7qp5BoCEEM5YoFu3K3VNa+mIo9yk7LJGM=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2479\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a> and European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Chemoradiotherapy after initial chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Where available, stereotactic body RT (SBRT) is an alternative to chemoradiotherapy, although there are no trials establishing the comparable efficacy of SBRT and standard fractionation EBRT in this setting. Ideally, treatment with SBRT should be undertaken in the context of a clinical trial. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Stereotactic body radiotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While it is reasonable to restage and reevaluate the potential for resectability after chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, the frequency of a R0 resection and long-term survival are low for patients who initially have categorically unresectable tumors. Nevertheless, in our view, all patients who have a response to therapy and no distant metastatic disease after initial medical therapy who retain an acceptable performance status and comorbidity profile, and who prefer aggressive therapy should undergo exploration. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Role of surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RT as a single modality could be considered to palliate pain&nbsp;for a patient who is not considered a candidate for combined chemoradiotherapy due to medical comorbidities and whose pain is not adequately controlled with narcotic analgesics.

Local unresectability is usually (but not always) due to vascular invasion, particularly of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97571\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97571 \">figure 2</a>). Some cases are considered &quot;borderline&quot; resectable, mostly based upon vascular involvement, although the definition is variable. Although some of these patients will prove to be resectable with initial surgery, the likelihood of an incomplete resection is high.

The following represents our general approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For fit patients who are willing to accept the uncertainty of benefit, we suggest an initial attempt at downstaging with chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy, or a combination, followed by restaging and surgical exploration in responders rather than upfront surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This approach is consistent with guidelines from the NCCN and ESMO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-chemotherapy-and-radiation-for-nonmetastatic-locally-advanced-unresectable-and-borderline-resectable-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].
