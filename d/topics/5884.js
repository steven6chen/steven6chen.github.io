Connective tissues make up and support the skin, bones, blood vessels, and other organs. In people with EDS, a part of the connective tissue, such as collagen, is abnormal.</p><p>There are 6 main types of EDS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F99360\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99360 \">table 1</a>). Most types are caused by a problem with one or more genes, but the cause of the most common type (&quot;hypermobility&quot; type) is not known. In some cases, people get EDS because they get an abnormal gene from one or both of their parents. In other cases, the abnormal gene does not come from either parent, but appears on its own.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1161459833\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of EDS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each type of EDS has slightly different symptoms. In most cases, the skin and joints are affected.</p><p>Common symptoms of EDS include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stretchy skin &ndash; When pulled, the skin stretches more than normal. The medical term for this is &quot;hyperextensibility.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Easy bruising of the skin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thin skin that can get cut easily &ndash; Cuts can take longer to heal. When they heal, they can leave abnormal-looking scars.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joints that are too loose and more flexible than normal &ndash; The medical term for this is &quot;hypermobility.&quot; Loose joints can lead to problems like dislocation (when a joint pops out of place) or pain.</p><p/><p>Some types of EDS can lead to more serious problems. For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some people with EDS have heart problems, although this is uncommon. One example is a widening of the aorta, which is the big artery that carries blood from the heart to the body. Another example is a condition called &quot;mitral valve prolapse,&quot; in which one of the valves in the heart doesn't close normally. These heart problems are not always serious, but if you have them, your doctor can decide if they need treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most serious problem people can get is a sudden tear in a blood vessel or organ wall. When this happens, it can cause internal bleeding and be life threatening. But this is usually only a risk with certain types of EDS, including vascular EDS.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1161459852\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for EDS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are tests that can check for the genes that cause <strong>most</strong> types of EDS. But one type, called &quot;hypermobility EDS,&quot; does not have a test. That's because doctors don't yet know which gene is affected in most people with this type.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1161459865\"><span class=\"h1\">How is EDS treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no cure for EDS. But your doctor or specialist can work with you to treat some of the symptoms and prevent or reduce some of the problems EDS can cause. Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical therapy &ndash; You can work with a physical therapist (exercise expert) to learn exercises to safely strengthen your muscles and joints.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Braces or other devices &ndash; Knee braces, shoe inserts, or a cane can help support the joints.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain medicines &ndash; Your doctor might tell you to take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) for joint and muscle pain. He or she might also suggest NSAIDs, which include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve). But NSAIDs might not be safe in people whose skin bruises easily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Counseling &ndash; If you are having a hard time dealing with the effects of EDS on your life, counseling can help.</p><p/><p>Many people with EDS need to see a heart doctor regularly. This is to monitor any heart problems and check for new ones.</p><p>If you suddenly get any of the following symptoms, go to the emergency room right away or <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>. These can be signs of internal bleeding or other serious problems caused by some types of EDS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest, back, or belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1161459878\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are things you can do to help with symptoms and prevent injury. You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get exercise, but be careful, and stop if your joints or muscles hurt.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid contact sports and other activities that could hurt your joints (like running). Try gentle activities like swimming or Tai Chi instead.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take hot baths to help with joint pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protect your skin with bandages or pads, especially if you often get cuts in certain areas (like the knees or shins).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid chewing gum and biting into hard foods, as this can cause jaw pain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1161459896\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you or your partner want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor or nurse before you start trying. If either of you has EDS, your children have a chance of getting it, too. You will probably want to meet with a geneticist or genetic counselor. They can help you understand what having the gene could mean for you and your family.</p><p>Women with EDS who do get pregnant need special care. Each type of EDS has different risks for a pregnant woman and her baby. You (or your partner) will need to see a doctor with experience caring for women with &quot;high-risk&quot; pregnancies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1161459907\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on which type you have. People with some types of EDS might only have mild symptoms, like stretchy skin and loose joints. But people with the more serious types can have life-threatening internal bleeding.</p><p>Every person is different, and it's impossible to know exactly how your EDS will affect you. But your doctor or nurse can talk to you about what to expect. It might also be helpful to talk with a specialist in medical genetics who has experience with EDS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61436032\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitral-valve-prolapse-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Mitral valve prolapse (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
