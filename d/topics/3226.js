Treatments for CIN include ablative or excisional cervical procedures. These treatments are often performed in reproductive-age women and may impact future fertility and pregnancy outcome. Awareness of reproductive risks associated with CIN treatment allows clinicians and patients to choose the optimal treatment method and to address subsequent reproductive issues.</p><p>CIN is also referred to as cervical dysplasia or cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (CSIL). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-terminology-incidence-pathogenesis-and-prevention#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Terminology, incidence, pathogenesis, and prevention&quot;, section on 'Terminology'</a>.)</p><p>Reproductive effects of CIN treatment are reviewed here.

In excisional procedures (also referred to as conization; procedures include cold knife conization, loop electrosurgical excision procedure [LEEP], and laser conization), a segment of the cervix is removed and examined histologically. In ablative procedures (techniques include cryotherapy, laser, cold coagulation, diathermy), the tissue is destroyed, but remains in place; no histologic confirmation of the diagnosis is performed.</p><p>LEEP and cold knife conization are the most commonly used excisional methods; cryotherapy is the most commonly used ablative therapy. Laser conization and ablation are used less frequently, since they require expensive and bulky equipment. Diathermy and cold coagulation ablation are rarely used.</p><p>Excisional therapy is the gold standard for treatment of CIN since it provides a specimen for histologic evaluation. Ablative therapy is reserved for women who are at a lower risk of invasive cervical cancer.</p><p>Indications and techniques for CIN treatment are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-management-of-low-grade-and-high-grade-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Management of low-grade and high-grade lesions&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Procedures for cervical conization&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Ablative therapies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF REPRODUCTIVE EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical surgery involves removal or destruction of tissue, which results in scarring. Theoretically, the integrity of the cervix is better preserved following ablation compared with excision. The mechanisms by which these changes affect reproductive function have not been thoroughly investigated. Available evidence and hypotheses regarding pathophysiology are presented in this section.</p><p>Tissue removal or destruction impacts both the cervical glands and stroma. Removal of cervical glands may adversely affect fertility by altering the cervical mucus that is necessary for normal sperm migration and viability. In addition, removal or destruction of a large portion of the collagen matrix that constitutes the cervical stroma may decrease tensile strength, thereby permitting the cervix to dilate prematurely during pregnancy.</p><p>Both removal of tissue and loss of cervical glands potentially increase the risk of ascending infection. A shorter cervix may predispose to migration of bacteria by increasing access from the vagina to the uterine cavity. Additionally, cervical mucus functions as a potential barrier to ascending infection. Some data suggest that women who have undergone CIN treatment are at an increased risk of microbial invasion of the amniotic fluid, which is a risk factor for preterm delivery and maternal and neonatal sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Some studies have found that conization is followed by alterations in the normal vaginal flora, specifically a decrease in the amount of lactobacilli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There is no evidence that nonpregnant women with prior CIN treatment are at an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease.</p><p>Scarring presents as cervical stenosis or difficult cervical dilation during labor. Cervical scarring after treatment may also lead to a loss of cervical plasticity. This may render the membranes more vulnerable to shearing forces and potentially contribute to preterm premature rupture of membranes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CERVICAL STENOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scarring from cervical surgery may result in cervical stenosis. Cervical stenosis has several potential adverse effects. A stenotic cervix impairs the clinician's ability to examine the transformation zone and endocervical canal and increases the difficulty of office procedures that typically would not require mechanical dilation (eg, endometrial biopsy). Stenosis partially or completely occludes access to the uterine cavity and may interfere with conception or impede menstrual flow; in severe cases, hematometra or pyometra can occur. In pregnant women with cervical stenosis, the cervix may fail to dilate normally during labor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cervical anomalies and benign cervical lesions&quot;, section on 'Cervical stenosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-female-infertility#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of female infertility&quot;, section on 'Cervical factors'</a>.)</p><p>Cervical stenosis following excisional treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) has been reported in up to 8 percent of patients. Risk factors for cervical stenosis in women undergoing excisional treatment include the amount of tissue removed (eg, incision depth of &ge;1 to 2 cm was associated with cervical stenosis) and postmenopausal status. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Procedures for cervical conization&quot;, section on 'Late complications'</a>.)</p><p>Cervical stenosis appears to be rare (1 percent or less) after cryotherapy or laser ablation. The risk of cervical stenosis following cervical ablation is increased in women with a history of in-utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Ablative therapies&quot;, section on 'Late complications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">INFERTILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) does not appear to impair fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. A meta-analysis of 15 mostly retrospective studies of women treated for CIN found that treated versus untreated women who had an intention to conceive did not have a significant difference in pregnancy rates (two studies; 88 versus<em> </em>95 percent; relative risk [RR] 0.93, 95% CI 0.80-1.08) or the proportion of women requiring more than 12 months to conceive (three studies; 15 versus 9 percent; RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.89-2.37) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SECOND TRIMESTER PREGNANCY LOSS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Previous cervical conization is associated with an increased risk of second trimester pregnancy loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p>The largest single study was a population-based study that compared 15,108 births in women who had previously undergone cervical conization (cold knife, laser, or loop electrosurgical excision procedure [LEEP]) with two other data sets: 2,164,006 births in women who had no cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) treatment and 57,136 births in women who underwent cervical conization after their index pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The risk of delivery at &lt;24 weeks of gestation was significantly higher in women with prior conization compared with either those who subsequently underwent conization or had no CIN treatment (1.5 versus 0.4 percent). A limitation of this study was that the results for each type of conization were not reported separately.</p><p>Similarly, a meta-analysis of 15 mostly retrospective studies of women treated for CIN found no significant increase in the rate of first trimester miscarriage (four studies; 9.8 versus 8.4 percent; relative risk [RR] 1.16, 95% CI 0.80-1.69), but a significant increase in the rate of second trimester pregnancy loss (eight studies; 1.6 versus 0.4 percent; RR 2.60, 95% CI 1.45-4.67) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>There are no data regarding second trimester pregnancy loss in women treated for CIN specifically with ablative methods. The availability of these data is limited, since second trimester pregnancy losses are rare, and birth registries do not usually collect information on second trimester miscarriages or preterm deliveries beyond 20 or 22 weeks, which further makes studies more difficult.</p><p>A large population-based study based on Norwegian registry data included almost 10,000 singleton births in women with prior treatment for cervical neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Prior treatment compared with no treatment was associated with a significant increase in the risk of spontaneous abortion (0.5 versus 0.2 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 2.5, 95% CI 1.7-3.7), with the strongest effect in women who underwent LEEP or laser conization. The study included all pregnancy loss through 22 complete weeks of gestation, and thus did not give data for first versus second trimester, and also used a later gestational age then the standard definition (20 weeks).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETERM PREMATURE RUPTURE OF MEMBRANES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is increased in women with a history of some, but not all cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) treatment procedures. This was demonstrated in a meta-analysis of 27 retrospective studies of women who had been treated for CIN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The risk of PPROM was significantly increased in women who had previously undergone loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) compared with those who had no CIN treatment (5 versus 2 percent). Laser conization and ablation were not associated with a significant increase in PPROM frequency. There were no data regarding cold knife conization or cryotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETERM DELIVERY AND PERINATAL MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of preterm delivery or perinatal mortality varies by type of cervical procedure and, for excisional procedures, also possibly by the amount of tissue removed.

There are mixed data regarding the risks of preterm delivery following loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) and laser conization.

One study found no statistically significant increase in the risk of preterm delivery with laser conization, but the study did not have sufficient power to detect a difference in this outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>This meta-analysis was designed to study very serious outcomes: perinatal mortality and very preterm (28 to 32 weeks) and extremely (under 28 weeks) preterm births, not late preterm births (from &gt;34 to &lt;37 weeks). While late preterm infants are less likely than those delivered earlier to have long-term sequelae of prematurity, late preterm delivery is associated with increased morbidity and mortality compared with term infants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=late-preterm-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Late preterm infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By contrast, several subsequent studies have found an association between LEEP and preterm delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. The largest of these was a population-based study based on Norwegian registry data that included almost 10,000 singleton births from 1998 to 2014 in women with prior treatment for cervical neoplasia compared with births in untreated women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Among treated women, 72 percent were younger than 30 years. Overall, prior treatment was associated with a significantly increased risk of birth at &lt;37 weeks (9.7 versus 5.3 percent; hazard ratio [HR] 1.8, 95% CI 1.7-2.0). The strongest associations were seen for cold knife conization (13 versus 5.3 percent; HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3&ndash;5.3) and laser conization (12 versus 5.3; HR 2.3, 95% CI 2.0&ndash;2.5), but a significant increase in risk was also found for LEEP (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.7). The degree of increased risk was larger for more severe prematurity; 22 to 27 weeks (0.9 versus 0.3 percent; HR 2.6. 95% CI 2.0&ndash;3.4) was higher than at later gestational ages.</p><p>Another large study was a Danish population-based study that reported a significantly increased risk of spontaneous preterm delivery at all gestational ages in 8180 women who had undergone LEEP compared with other women: 21 to 27 weeks (0.6 versus 0.2 percent); 28 to 31 weeks (0.8 versus 0.3 percent); and 32 to 36 weeks (5.0 versus 2.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Ablative methods did not increase the risk of perinatal mortality and preterm delivery. For women who underwent cryotherapy, the rate of perinatal mortality was 0.2 percent and the rates of preterm delivery were 0.6 at &lt;32 to 34 weeks and 2.2 percent at &lt;28 to 30 weeks. Only a small number of studies investigated perinatal risks following laser ablation; further study of this method is needed.</p><p>A limitation of most studies in this meta-analysis is that women with CIN treatment were compared with healthy obstetric controls rather than with women with CIN who did not undergo treatment. Some, but not all, studies have reported that CIN, regardless of treatment, is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/17,19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19-22</a>]. This may be due to characteristics that are found commonly in women with CIN as well as those who have a preterm delivery (eg, smoking, bacterial vaginosis, low socioeconomic status) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. As an example, a Scottish national registry study found that women with CIN3 (n = 3113) were significantly more likely to have spontaneous preterm delivery (11 versus 6 percent) and preterm premature rupture of membranes (8 versus 6 percent) than other women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Of note, among women with CIN, the risks of these outcomes were increased regardless of whether the CIN was treated or not.</p><p>Thus, use of a control group without CIN may result in an overestimate of the preterm birth rate in women treated for CIN. This assertion is supported by several studies that used women with CIN as a control group and have reported a lower relative risk of preterm delivery than the meta-analysis of 20 studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/11,19,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,19,26,27</a>].</p><p>A subsequent retrospective British study evaluated outcomes in a population that included over 14,000 births after a cervical punch biopsy or excisional treatment at 1 of 12 colposcopy centers. There was modest association between prior excisional therapy and an increase in the rate of preterm delivery compared with a prior punch biopsy (9.1 versus 8.3 percent; RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.01-1.41) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This study was limited by a lack of subset analysis by gestational age at delivery and type of excisional treatment, so is less informative than the meta-analysis described above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Modifying factors</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Depth of excision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Greater depth of excision (cone depth of &ge;10 mm up the cervical canal) appears to be an independent risk factor for preterm birth and premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) in subsequent pregnancies, based on observational studies of LEEP or laser conization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/5,18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,18,20</a>]. As an example, a Danish population-based study evaluated over 8000 deliveries in women who had undergone LEEP conization. The risk for preterm birth increased by 6 percent for each additional excised millimeter beyond 12 mm. Similarly, a case-control study in England of 768 preterm births compared the risk following a cervical punch biopsy (7.2 percent) and found no significant increase after shallow (&lt;10 mm) cervical excision (7.5 percent) or medium (10 to 14 mm) excision (9.6 percent, although this trended toward statistical significance: RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.98-1.68) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A significant increase was found after large (15 to 19 mm) excision (15.3 percent) or very large (&ge;20 mm) excision (18.0 percent).</p><p>A case-control study nested in record linkage cohort study involving 11,471 women with colposcopy and subsequent delivery from England found also association between size of excision and risk for preterm birth. The risk for preterm birth was not increased among women with small (&lt;10 mm) excision (absolute risk 7.5 percent, 95% CI 6 to 8.9 percent) or punch biopsy (absolute risk 7.2 percent, 95% CI 5.9 to 8.5 percent) when compared with the background population (6.7 percent). The absolute risk was 9.6 percent for 10 to 14 mm excisions, 15.3 percent for 15 to 19 mm excisions, and 18 percent for excisions larger than 20 mm. Similar results with a somewhat stronger association were found for all extreme preterm births (n = 161 women) with deep excision (&lt;20 mm) versus small ones (RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.56-6.47) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>A prospective pilot study included 142 women who underwent LEEP conization, and pretreatment and posttreatment cervical dimensions and cone size were measured with magnetic resonance imaging, three-dimensional transvaginal ultrasonography, or two-dimensional transvaginal ultrasonography, and the correlation between pregnancy outcomes and the relative proportion of the cervix excised was assessed.

A potential mechanism of an increase in the risk of preterm birth in this setting is incomplete healing of the cervical epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Among the few studies that have addressed this question, a limitation is that some have used treatment to delivery interval as an outcome. This is less preferable than excision to conception interval, since delivery time may be altered by differences in pregnancy duration (ie, preterm pregnancies are shorter than term pregnancies).</p><p>The available data include a nested case-control study that reported that a shorter conization (either cold knife or LEEP) to conception interval (2.5 versus 10.5 months) was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of preterm delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>In contrast, other studies did not find an increased risk of preterm birth in women with a short interval between cervical treatment and delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/12,20,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,20,33,34</a>]. As an example, a population-based retrospective cohort study of over 8000 women who underwent LEEP that found that those who delivered within &lt;1 year compared with &ge;1 year post-LEEP had no significant difference in the rate of preterm delivery (6.6 versus 5.9 to 7.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Similarly, a multicenter retrospective cohort study (n = 596) found that an interval from LEEP to pregnancy of &lt;12 months compared with &ge;12 months was associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion (17.9 versus 4.6 percent), but no increased risk of preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>In the large English study, most of the births conceived more than three years from colposcopy, but the risk for preterm birth did not seem to depend on time from excision to conception. However, insufficient data were available on women who conceived within six months from small or medium sized excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Based on the majority of the available evidence, a short conization to conception interval does not appear to increase the risk of preterm birth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Multiple gestation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some data suggest that a history of LEEP may further increase the risk of preterm delivery in women with multiple gestation. As an example, a retrospective study of over 9000 women with multiple gestation, 166 of whom had undergone a LEEP, reported a higher rate of preterm delivery in the women with a history of LEEP (43 versus 33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Further study of this issue is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Summary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main priority for women with CIN is to diagnose or prevent cervical cancer. As noted above, the gold standard for CIN treatment is excisional treatment, but less invasive methods appear to result in fewer reproductive risks. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Excision versus ablation'</a> above.)</p><p>Ablative methods (cryotherapy, laser ablation) are not associated with increased risks of perinatal mortality or preterm delivery, although there are few data regarding laser ablation. For women who are planning future pregnancy and are candidates for all methods of CIN treatment, we suggest ablation in selected cases. Ablative methods can be used for women with squamous disease that is low-grade or selected women with small high-grade lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up#H518651\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Treatment and follow-up&quot;, section on 'Future obstetric risks'</a>.)</p><p>Women who are at a higher risk of invasive cervical cancer should be treated with excisional therapy. LEEP does not appear to increase the risk of perinatal mortality or preterm delivery at &le;34 weeks. LEEP seems, however, to be safer than cold knife conization. Data conflict regarding the association between LEEP and delivery at &le;34 weeks. The highest quality data, a meta-analysis of 20 observational studies, found no increased risk. A large register-based study consisting of more than 10,000 deliveries found an increased risk for preterm birth. It appears that there is an increased risk of at least late preterm delivery in women who have undergone LEEP. The depth of excision appears to influence the risk of preterm delivery.</p><p>Available evidence shows no effect of laser conization on these perinatal outcomes. By contrast, cold knife conization is associated with a threefold or higher increased risk of perinatal mortality and preterm delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Procedures for cervical conization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Given this difference between cold knife conization compared with other excisional treatments, we recommend not using this method in women who are planning pregnancy, whenever possible. Decisions regarding the need for cold knife conization are made by most surgeons for each patient based upon characteristics of the patient (cervical cancer risk factors, including results of human papillomavirus [HPV] serotype testing) or lesion (grade, size, histology, recurrence).</p><p>Women who desire future childbearing and in whom cold knife conization is planned should be counseled about subsequent reproductive risks. Shared decision-making between the clinician and such patients is necessary regarding the trade-off between the risk of cervical cancer and potential reproductive risks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">PERFORMANCE OF PROCEDURES DURING PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical ablation or excision performed during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome, including heavy vaginal bleeding and spontaneous abortion. As such, every effort should be made to avoid such procedures during pregnancy, although they may be needed in select cases to exclude invasive disease. In these cases, an excisional procedure in the operating room, with removal of a shallow cone to rule out invasive disease, is usually advised. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical cancer in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">OBSTETRIC MANAGEMENT IN SUBSEQUENT PREGNANCIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At a preconceptional or first obstetric visit, women should be asked regarding prior treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Women with this history should be counseled about the risks of preterm delivery and associated complications (eg, preterm premature rupture of membranes, perinatal mortality).</p><p>Prospective series have found that a short cervix on second trimester transvaginal ultrasound examination was predictive of an increased risk of preterm birth in women who have had previous conization, similar to other women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Given the risk of preterm delivery following cold knife conization, we recommend surveillance with serial transvaginal sonographic cervical length measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Ultrasound examinations are typically performed every other week from 16 to 32 weeks. Cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin (fFN) testing can be added as clinically indicated after 22 weeks gestation to further refine the risk for preterm birth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-preterm-labor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of preterm labor&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The role of prophylactic cerclage in women who have undergone cold knife conization has not been well studied. In one retrospective study of 108 women with prior conization, the rate of preterm delivery was similar in those with and without a prophylactic cerclage (23 versus 21 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-reproductive-effects-of-treatment/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In general, the effectiveness of prophylactic cerclage is controversial and its use is associated with perinatal risks. We suggest not performing prophylactic cerclage in women based solely on a history of cold knife conization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For women who have had a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), the risk of preterm delivery, if any, is after 34 weeks. This is beyond the usual period of cervical length surveillance (up to 32 weeks). Thus, we suggest not performing routine cervical length surveillance in women who have undergone LEEP. Surveillance may be reasonable in women who have had a very deep LEEP conization (&gt;1 to 2 cm) or two or more LEEP procedures.
