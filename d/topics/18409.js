Available tests to demonstrate prior tuberculosis infection include the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs).

In most individuals infected with <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, mononuclear cells in the blood release interferon-gamma when stimulated with antigens derived from <em>M. tuberculosis</em>. A large number of studies have evaluated IGRAs, and these have been summarized in systematic reviews and guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-interferon-gamma-release-assays-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/2-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-15</a>].</p><p>To perform an IGRA test, a blood sample is incubated with antigens and controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-interferon-gamma-release-assays-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. IGRA results can be available in 24 to 48 hours (although it can take longer in routine practice because of batching of samples) and do not require a follow-up visit for reading of results (in contrast with the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> [TST]).</p><p>IGRAs are surrogate markers of <em>M. tuberculosis </em>infection and indicate a cellular immune response to <em>M. tuberculosis</em>. IGRAs cannot distinguish between latent infection and active tuberculosis (TB) disease and should not be used for diagnosis of active TB, which is a microbiologic diagnosis. A positive IGRA result may not necessarily indicate active TB, and a negative IGRA result may not rule out active TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-interferon-gamma-release-assays-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>].

In contrast, the specificity of TST varies depending on timing of BCG and whether repeated (booster) vaccinations are given.

Some NTM that infect humans (including <em>M. marinum,</em> <em>M. szulgai,</em> <em>M. flavescens</em>, and <em>M. kansasii</em>) contain gene sequences that encode for antigens used in IGRAs (early secreted antigenic target 6 [ESAT-6] or culture filtrate protein 10 [CFP-10]). Infection with these NTM has been shown to produce positive results in IGRAs using these antigens (as with the TST) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-interferon-gamma-release-assays-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4850554\"><span class=\"h2\">Assay antigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A positive IGRA test may detect one or more antigens. <em>M. tuberculosis</em>&ndash;specific antigens include ESAT-6 and CFP-10. These are encoded by genes located within the region of difference 1 (RD1) segment of the <em>M. tuberculosis</em> genome. They are more specific for <em>M. tuberculosis</em> than purified protein derivative (PPD) because they are not shared with any BCG vaccine strains or most species of NTM (other than <em>M. marinum,</em> <em>M. szulgai,</em> <em>M. flavescens</em>, and <em>M. kansasii</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-interferon-gamma-release-assays-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The current QFT-Gold In-Tube test also contains peptides from antigen 7.7, which is not encoded by these genes but are specific to <em>M. tuberculosis</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4850561\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Available IGRAs include the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay, which has replaced the second-generation QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) assay and the T-SPOT.TB assay. Both tests are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are also available in Canada, Europe, and many other countries.</p><p>The QFT-GIT assay is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based whole-blood test that uses peptides from three TB antigens (ESAT-6, CFP-10, and TB7.7) in an in-tube format. The result is reported as quantification of interferon-gamma in international units per mL. An individual is considered positive for <em>M. tuberculosis</em> infection if the interferon-gamma response to TB antigens is above the test cut-off (after subtracting the background interferon-gamma response in the negative control).</p><p>A newer assay, the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus), became available in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-interferon-gamma-release-assays-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This test is available in Europe but not in North America. The QFT-Plus assay has two TB antigen tubes, unlike the other QFT assay (which has a single TB antigen tube). Both tubes contain peptide antigens from ESAT-6 and CFP-10 (not TB7.7). The first tube contains peptides from ESAT-6 and CFP-10 that are designed to elicit cellular responses from CD4+ T helper lymphocytes; the second tube contains an additional set of peptides targeted to induce cellular responses from CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes.</p><p>The T-SPOT.TB is an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay performed on separated and counted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs); it uses ESAT-6 and CFP-10 peptides. The result is reported as number of interferon-gamma&ndash;producing T cells (spot-forming cells in antigen wells minus negative control wells). An individual is considered positive for <em>M. tuberculosis</em> infection if the spot counts in the TB antigen wells exceed a specific threshold relative to the control wells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4851487\"><span class=\"h2\">Sensitivity and specificity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IGRAs have specificity &gt;95 percent for diagnosis of TB infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-interferon-gamma-release-assays-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

Lower CD4 counts have been associated with higher rates of indeterminate IGRA results; this is especially the case with QFT-GIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-interferon-gamma-release-assays-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. T-SPOT appears to be less affected by immunosuppression than QFT-GIT, likely because the procedure requires that an adequate number of peripheral blood mononuclear cells are placed in each test well (even if the overall peripheral blood lymphocyte count is low) and the test does not correct for absolute T lymphocyte number [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-interferon-gamma-release-assays-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>For the diagnosis of active TB, IGRA sensitivity and specificity are poor, particularly in high TB incidence settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-interferon-gamma-release-assays-for-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>].

In addition, IGRAs require fresh blood samples, and transportation delays can affect test performance. Blood specimens for the QFT assay must be placed in an incubator as soon as possible and within 16 hours of blood collection.

However, if the T-Cell Xtend reagent is used, whole blood can be stored overnight prior to processing in the T-SPOT.TB assay.</p><p>Test kits must be transported and stored in optimum conditions to prevent exposure to excessive heat.

Available tests to demonstrate prior tuberculosis infection include the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76107\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76107 \">table 1</a>).

They are in vitro blood tests of cell-mediated immune response to <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> and measure T cell release of interferon-gamma following stimulation by antigens specific to <em>M. tuberculosis</em>. (See <a href=\"#H365757202\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two major IGRAs available: the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) assay and the T-SPOT.TB assay. QFT-GIT is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based whole blood test. T-SPOT.TB is an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) performed on separated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). (See <a href=\"#H4850561\" class=\"local\">'Types of assays'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IGRAs are not affected by Bacille Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) vaccination status and have specificity &gt;95 percent for diagnosis of LTBI. IGRAs are preferred for patients with history of BCG vaccination, especially if received in countries where BCG is given after infancy or repeated.

(See <a href=\"#H4851487\" class=\"local\">'Sensitivity and specificity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IGRAs cannot distinguish between latent infection and active TB disease and should not be used for diagnosis of active TB.
