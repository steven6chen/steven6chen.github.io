A local recurrence is defined as reappearance of cancer in the ipsilateral preserved breast. In contrast, a regional recurrence denotes tumor involving the ipsilateral regional lymph nodes, usually ipsilateral axillary or supraclavicular, and less commonly infraclavicular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> internal mammary. The term locoregional recurrence is used to indicate a recurrence in either the ipsilateral breast or regional nodal basin.</p><p>The primary management of breast cancer has changed considerably over the past decade, and this may alter the incidence, presentation, and management of locoregional recurrences. With advances in systemic adjuvant therapy that have led to better survival rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], more isolated locoregional recurrences, sometimes delayed for several years, may become apparent. The increasing use of neoadjuvant or induction chemotherapy to allow for breast conservation, as well as the increasing popularity of partial breast irradiation, may also affect local recurrence rates. Furthermore, the use of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy rather than axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) as a method of staging the axilla may not only impact the incidence of regional recurrence but has also altered the approach to the patient with an isolated locoregional recurrence. </p><p>Aggressive multimodality treatment has the potential to provide long-term disease control for many patients who develop an isolated locoregional recurrence after BCT. Multidisciplinary evaluation and management of these cases appears to improve patient outcome and overall satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The management of a locoregional recurrence after BCT for operable breast cancer will be reviewed here. The management of a locoregional recurrence after mastectomy, patterns of recurrence, and recommendations for post-treatment surveillance are discussed in detail elsewhere.

In contrast, the reappearance of disease in an ipsilateral preserved breast can represent either a local recurrence of the initial cancer or a second primary tumor. Ipsilateral new primary breast cancers tend to develop later in the follow-up period than do true local recurrences, and the prognosis is more favorable. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'True recurrence versus second primary tumor'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although some data sets describe a similar overall prognosis for locoregional disease recurrence after mastectomy, as compared with BCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], postmastectomy failures are more likely to involve regional nodes, and these cases are associated with higher rates of simultaneous distant metastases and poorer cause-specific survival.</p><p/><p>Local recurrence after BCT may be either invasive or in situ cancer. For patients who were initially treated for invasive disease, more than 80 percent of locoregional recurrences are invasive; the remainder of locoregional recurrences are noninvasive (intraductal) lesions. Approximately 75 percent are isolated to the breast and clinically solitary; 5 to 15 percent present with a simultaneous regional nodal recurrence, and another 5 to 15 percent have distant metastases at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/8,10,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,13-15</a>].</p><p>In contrast, for patients initially treated for in situ cancer (ductal carcinoma in situ [DCIS]), approximately one-half will recur with invasive disease, whereas the remainder will have a recurrence of DCIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

As an example, one report included 126 patients with an IBTR after BCT, 48 of which were classified as a new primary and 78 as a true recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The patients with second primary tumors had significantly better 10-year rates of cause-specific survival (83 versus 49 percent), distant disease-free survival (77 versus 26 percent), and local recurrence (2 versus 18 percent).

In both series, patients who were identified by molecular testing as having a recurrent rather than second primary breast cancer were at significantly higher risk for distant metastatic disease. Although these data suggest the potential for tailoring therapy based upon molecular classification in the future, ipsilateral second primary tumors are not treated differently from true recurrences at present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR A LOCAL RECURRENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two most important predictors of increased risk for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) are the use of radiation therapy (RT) and pathologic margin status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RT is considered a standard component of breast-conserving therapy (BCT) for the majority of women with invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). As such, RT is routinely recommended, and its elimination after BCS is a major risk factor for both recurrence and mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-radiation-therapy-for-women-with-newly-diagnosed-non-metastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant radiation therapy for women with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Margin status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For all patients undergoing BCS, tumor excision should be complete, such that negative margins are achieved. The goal should be to ensure that there is no tumor at the inked border on microscopic pathologic examination; wider surgical margins appear to have no impact on the rate of IBTR. </p><p>Individuals with negative excision margins (typically defined by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project [NSABP] as the absence of either invasive or intraductal disease at the inked margin) have lower rates of IBTR compared with those who have involved margins. In one series, the local control rate was 100 percent among patients with negative margins versus 78 percent for those without negative margins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These and other data sets emphasize the importance of obtaining pathologic tumor-free margins. Positive or unknown histologic margins should prompt reexcision, since such patients are at higher risk for local recurrence even when RT is administered.</p><p>While the pathologic finding of negative margins (ie, no evidence of tumor at the inked border on microscopic examination) optimally reduces the risk of an IBTR, wider margin widths do not significantly lower this risk. This was shown in an analysis of pooled data from 21 trials of women with early breast cancer treated with BCT (n = 14,571) that included 1026 women who developed a local recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. While a positive margin or a margin less than 1 mm was associated with increased risk of local recurrence, there was no significant difference in the odds of local recurrence by the width of a negative margin attained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>On the basis of these data and their own systematic review, a multidisciplinary consensus panel concluded that more widely clear margins that go beyond a finding of no tumor at the inked border on microscopic pathologic examination have no significant impact on the rate of IBTR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

In modern series, local recurrences are detected by mammography alone approximately 40 to 75 percent of the time, by physical examination alone in 10 to 30 percent, by a combination of mammography and physical examination in 10 to 25 percent, and by other imaging modalities (eg, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) in 5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-42</a>].</p><p>Both radiation therapy (RT) and surgery can lead to changes in the breast, such as mass-like fibrosis, that can be difficult to distinguish from a local recurrence on physical examination. Furthermore, the findings associated with a local recurrence may be subtle, particularly if the primary tumor was an infiltrating lobular cancer. In such cases, a local recurrence may be associated with only minimal thickening or retraction of the biopsy site without a mass. Any change in the examination more than one or two years after completion of RT must be viewed as suspicious for recurrence and worked up. Since approximately one-half of IBTRs detected on physical examination are mammographically occult, a normal mammogram in the face of a change on physical examination does not rule out the possibility of a local recurrence.</p><p>Because mammographic sensitivity may be limited for detection of recurrent disease in an architecturally changed breast, there has been significant interest in adjunctive imaging strategies such as breast MRI. There are accumulating reports of MRI-detected, mammographically occult breast cancer recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/43-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-51</a>]. However, although MRI is more sensitive than is mammography, it is less specific, resulting in more false-positive biopsies. As a result, the use of MRI as a surveillance tool or in the workup of a suspected recurrence is controversial and still under investigation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-following-treatment-for-breast-cancer#H560048\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient following treatment for breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Breast imaging'</a>.)</p><p>Rarely, local recurrences after breast-conserving therapy (BCT) are inflammatory or extensively involve the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/52-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-55</a>]. Often, these are misdiagnosed as postoperative infection. Any patient with a history of breast cancer and new inflammatory-type changes in the breast (erythema, warmth, peau d'orange appearance) who does not respond readily to antibiotics should undergo a biopsy to rule out recurrent disease. In general, these patients have a poor prognosis.</p><p>Patients may also present with signs or symptoms of a regional recurrence, the clinical picture of which may be changing with the increasing use of sentinel lymph node biopsy. Many patients present with palpable adenopathy in the axilla or supraclavicular fossa, although a regional recurrence may also present with pain in either location or the new onset of brachial plexopathy or lymphedema of the arm. These may occur in the absence of palpable adenopathy. Any patient who develops new-onset lymphedema following breast cancer treatment should be evaluated for the possibility of a regional recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any new clinical or radiographic finding after BCT for operable breast cancer should prompt a biopsy. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is a simple and accurate method for differentiating scar from recurrent carcinoma. However, tissue biopsy (core needle or excisional) may be needed not only to confirm the diagnosis of a local recurrence but also to assay the tumor tissue for hormone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression, factors that are important for treatment decisions regarding adjuvant chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hormonal therapy.

Of the eight, five remained alive and disease-free, all of whom had isolated axillary locoregional recurrences. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of axillary recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optimal treatment for an axillary regional recurrence has not been well established. However, the possibility of long-term disease-free survival with multimodality treatment is suggested by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outcomes of 28 patients with an isolated axillary nodal recurrence after BCT for early-stage breast cancer were reported at the 2004 meeting of American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Four patients (14 percent) had a simultaneous IBTR. Local therapy consisted of axillary surgery alone in 16 and axillary surgery plus RT in nine, and treatment was unknown in three. Systemic therapy was administered to 23 patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a preliminary report with a median follow-up of 6.2 years after axillary recurrence, 11 (39 percent) had no subsequent recurrence of breast cancer, seven developed a subsequent regional recurrence, and 12 (43 percent) developed distant metastatic disease. Five years after repeat treatment, 56 percent were alive and free of disease recurrence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another series included 44 patients with an axillary recurrence as the initial treatment failure site: 30 isolated to the axilla, 12 with axillary plus other locoregional recurrence, and two with axillary plus distant recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. Treatment consisted of surgical resection in 20, irradiation in two, chemotherapy in 20, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> in two. Multimodality therapy was given to 33 patients (75 percent), and nine patients received systemic therapy alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">At an average 27 months post-treatment follow-up, complete and durable local control was achieved in 31 (71 percent), but distant metastases developed in 22 (50 percent). Patients who had locally uncontrolled recurrences were significantly more likely to develop distant metastases (77 versus 39 percent, respectively). Patients who received surgery as a component of therapy were more likely to have locally controlled disease (89 versus 41 percent). In contrast, omission of RT or systemic therapy did not correlate with control of disease or rates of distant metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another retrospective series of 59 patients with an axillary recurrence after surgery for operable breast cancer, 41 of whom received surgery, the five-year actuarial survival rate was 39 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Summary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is not enough evidence to define the optimal treatment for patients with an isolated axillary regional recurrence, and practice is variable. However, multidisciplinary evaluation and management is essential.</p><p>If there is no evidence of distant metastatic spread, every attempt should be made to resect the recurrent disease. For patients who had an initially negative SLN biopsy but who now have an axillary recurrence, a complete ALND (levels I and II) is indicated. For patients who have not previously received regional nodal irradiation, RT is often recommended, although there are no data proving benefit for RT after ALND in this setting, and lymphedema rates may be significantly higher when an ALND is followed by RT. Because of these issues, some institutions withhold RT unless the area of disease recurrence cannot be completely resected.</p><p>For patients who have an axillary recurrence after a prior ALND, an attempt at resection is warranted. Local outcomes seem to be most favorable when resection is followed by RT, with or without systemic therapy, likely because of incomplete resection in such cases. It is highly unlikely for radiation alone to provide durable local control in the setting of gross disease. If the disease cannot be resected, then systemic therapy can sometimes be used to decrease the extent of disease prior to radiation. For patients who have previously undergone regional irradiation, systemic therapy alone is indicated. Regional RT is typically not repeated due to concern for brachial plexopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of isolated supraclavicular recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Tumor, Nodes, Metastasis (TNM) staging classification for breast cancer considers supraclavicular disease as N3 involvement rather than a metastatic (M) site. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-classification-for-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging classification for breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite this, there is debate as to whether patients with isolated supraclavicular relapse should be considered as having disseminated disease or locoregional disease for which aggressive treatment with curative intent is justified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. Outcomes are less favorable for patients with an isolated supraclavicular as compared with axillary regional recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of locoregional recurrence of breast cancer after mastectomy&quot;, section on 'Prognostic factors'</a>.)</p><p>All of the published data on treatment and outcomes among women with ipsilateral isolated supraclavicular node recurrences after either mastectomy or BCT come from retrospective analyses; there are no randomized trials. These data are presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of locoregional recurrence of breast cancer after mastectomy&quot;, section on 'Isolated supraclavicular recurrence'</a>.)</p><p>Taken together, the data support the view that while the presence of supraclavicular nodal disease heralds a poor prognosis, a small number of patients who present with isolated supraclavicular nodal relapse will have a prolonged period of disease-free survival after multimodality therapy, and some may be cured. The optimal treatment for these patients has not been established. However, multidisciplinary evaluation and management is essential.</p><p>For patients who are considered candidates for systemic therapy, initial systemic therapy is preferred. At the time of restaging, if there is still no evidence of distant metastatic spread, surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> RT could be considered for disease control, depending on the magnitude of the response, the volume of residual disease, and the expected morbidity of both therapies. RT alone may be used if the area was not previously irradiated, surgery alone if RT was previously given, or a combination approach if there has been an incomplete response to chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-mastectomy#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of locoregional recurrence of breast cancer after mastectomy&quot;, section on 'Isolated supraclavicular recurrence'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF SYSTEMIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For those patients who have undergone successful treatment of limited disease and have no other evidence of disease, the role of systemic therapy has been controversial. However, some data suggest that there is a benefit to post-excision chemotherapy, particularly among patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative disease. Therefore:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ER-negative disease (in whom endocrine therapy is not an option) may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy following resection of a locoregional recurrence. A referral to medical oncology is warranted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with ER-positive disease, endocrine therapy is the primary treatment. The role of chemotherapy should be individualized based on patient preferences and other factors because the benefit of additional chemotherapy in these patients is not clear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive disease may benefit from treatment with a HER2-directed agent. </p><p/><p>The role of systemic therapy in this situation is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-for-metastatic-breast-cancer-general-principles#H97037737\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment for metastatic breast cancer: General principles&quot;, section on 'Role of treatment after successful control of isolated, local, or regional recurrence'</a>.)</p><p>While systemic therapy has been a mainstay for the systemic treatment of metastatic disease, the CALOR (Chemotherapy as Adjuvant for Locally Recurrent Breast Cancer) trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locoregional-recurrence-of-breast-cancer-after-breast-conserving-therapy/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>] was a phase 3 randomized trial comparing adjuvant chemotherapy with no adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with isolated ipsilateral local or regional breast recurrences. Adjuvant chemotherapy reduced both distant and second local failures, and overall survival was significantly longer in the chemotherapy group. The patients with ER-negative tumors seemed to have the most benefit.&nbsp;Therefore, we recommend a medical oncology consultation for all patients with breast cancer recurrences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis and pretreatment evaluation</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Between 10 and 20 percent of patients will develop a locoregional recurrence within 10 years of undergoing breast-conserving therapy (BCT) for operable breast cancer.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median interval to develop a locoregional recurrence after BCT is three to four years.
