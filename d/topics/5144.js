Early recognition, emergency stabilization, and transport to an appropriate cardiac care center are critically important in the outcome of newborns with these lesions.</p><p>The evaluation and initial management of cyanotic CHD in the newborn are presented here.

As a result, prenatal sonography will miss some patients with cyanotic CHD.

The diagnosis is confirmed by echocardiography.</p><p>Central cyanosis caused by reduced arterial oxygen saturation is generally perceptible when the reduced hemoglobin level exceeds 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70325\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70325 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-cyanotic-heart-disease-in-the-newborn/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It can result from several different pathologic mechanisms that are caused by cardiac disorders, pulmonary abnormalities, or hemoglobinopathies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50161\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50161 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-cyanotic-heart-disease-in-the-newborn/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Once a cardiac etiology is determined, the examination also provides clues to the underlying specific cardiac defect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79941\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79941 \">table 2</a>). The differential diagnosis and the clinical findings that distinguish CHD from other disorders are discussed in the following topic reviews.

In some cases, findings may point to a specific cardiac lesion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blood pressure gradient between the arms and legs, or weakened or absent femoral pulses, suggests left ventricular dysfunction associated with severe coarctation of the aorta or interrupted aortic arch. If the ductus arteriosus is widely patent, no gradient may be detected between the arms and legs in these disorders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe respiratory distress manifested by tachypnea, retractions, and grunting usually indicates a respiratory problem. However, some structural heart diseases can present with similar symptoms. Examples of the latter include obstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous connection and left-sided obstructive disease (eg, hypoplastic left heart syndrome [HLHS], critical valvar aortic stenosis, and severe coarctation of the aorta). Infants with cyanotic CHD usually present with cyanosis with mild or absent tachypnea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identifying-newborns-with-critical-congenital-heart-disease#H190050011\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identifying newborns with critical congenital heart disease&quot;, section on 'Respiratory symptoms'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vital signs can be normal in some cyanotic infants with structural heart disease. They may also be normal in polycythemia, pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, or methemoglobinemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral cyanosis associated with tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension often suggests sepsis. However, it is also important to consider left-heart obstructive lesions with heart failure such as HLHS, critical aortic stenosis, and severe coarctation of the aorta in the differential diagnosis of peripheral cyanosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-causes-of-cyanosis-in-the-newborn#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac causes of cyanosis in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Heart failure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87807098\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulse oximetry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In cyanotic neonates, transcutaneous oxygen saturation (ie, pulse oximetry) should be measured from preductal (right hand) and postductal sites (right or left foot). Oxygen saturation values are reduced with central cyanosis and usually normal with peripheral cyanosis. A difference in values at the two sites identifies patients with differential cyanosis. In patients with a right aortic arch, the preductal saturation should be measured in the left hand. The routine use of pulse oximetry to screen for neonatal critical cardiac disease has been shown to be an effective screening test and is discussed separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Second heart sound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The second heart sound (S2) is normally split in inspiration (aortic component before pulmonary component). Splitting is usually audible in 66 percent of infants at 16 hours of age and in 80 percent by 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-cyanotic-heart-disease-in-the-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

TOF associated with pulmonary atresia often has a murmur associated with a patent ductus arteriosus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104792\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104792 \">movie 2</a>) or aortopulmonary collaterals that can be detected as pulmonary vascular resistance falls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A soft, outflow systolic murmur is heard in pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum, HLHS, or truncus arteriosus. In all of these lesions, the cardiac output crosses a single semilunar valve, and the volume of blood flow causes the associated murmur. Some patients with truncus arteriosus also have a diastolic murmur of truncal valve regurgitation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary atresia is often associated with tricuspid regurgitation. This produces a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tricuspid atresia is usually associated with a ventricular septal defect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104797\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104797 \">movie 3</a>) and pulmonary stenosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F104791\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef104791 \">movie 1</a>), which create systolic murmurs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tricuspid valve in Ebstein anomaly is nearly always regurgitant and produces a systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) with an intact ventricular septum and no pulmonary stenosis typically has no murmur.</p><p/><p>Descriptions and examples of innocent and pathologic murmurs in infants and children are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-a-cardiac-murmur\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the infant or child with a cardiac murmur&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Hepatomegaly</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatomegaly often occurs in patients with heart failure due to left-sided obstructive lesions (eg, HLHS, coarctation, critical aortic stenosis, and cardiomyopathy) or infradiaphragmatic total anomalous pulmonary venous connection. A palpable liver in the midline suggests complex congenital heart disease (heterotaxy syndromes) associated with asplenia or polysplenia.</p><p>Some infants with pulmonary disease can appear to have hepatomegaly, but this is caused by displacement by a flattened diaphragm due to hyperinflation. The liver span is not enlarged in these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest radiograph</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A chest radiograph is helpful in differentiating between cardiac and pulmonary disorders. Examination of the lung fields identifies major pulmonary causes of cyanosis including pneumothorax, pulmonary hypoplasia, diaphragmatic hernia, pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or airway disease.</p><p>Three features of the chest radiograph that can be suggestive of specific cardiac lesions are heart size or shape, pulmonary vascular markings, and situs of the aortic arch.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Heart size or shape</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart size</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with left-sided obstructive lesions may have cardiomegaly due to heart failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extreme cardiomegaly suggests lesions associated with a dilated right atrium since this chamber is very compliant. These include pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum or Ebstein anomaly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart shape &ndash; Characteristic abnormalities of heart shape are associated with specific lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>TOF &ndash; Boot-shaped (coeur en sabot) contour (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78997\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78997 \">image 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>D-TGA &ndash; Egg-on-a-string pattern caused by a narrow mediastinal shadow produced by the anterior-posterior rather than right-left relationship of the great arteries.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary vascular markings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pattern of pulmonary blood flow depends upon the specific cardiac lesion. Although decreased pulmonary vascular markings occur in most cyanotic CHD lesions, they are increased in patients with truncus arteriosus or mixing lesions, such as common atrioventricular canal, as pulmonary vascular resistance falls after delivery.</p><p>In D-TGA, vascular markings may be asymmetric. In this condition, the right pulmonary artery branches from the main pulmonary artery along the long-axis of the left ventricle while the left pulmonary artery branches acutely. This anatomy often promotes preferential increased flow to the right lung and asymmetric blood flow with reduced markings in the left lung.</p><p>Pulmonary venous congestion due to heart failure is characterized by indistinct vascular markings spreading in a butterfly distribution from the central region of the chest. This is often seen in obstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous connection or failure due to left-sided obstructive lesions (HLHS or severe coarctation of the aorta) or cardiomyopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Situs of aortic arch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The situs of the aortic arch is defined by which of the mainstem bronchi the arch crosses. This is best determined by the indentation of the trachea on the anteroposterior image indicating the side towards which the aortic arch is coursing. The normal anatomy is a left-sided aortic arch with indentation of the left side of the trachea as the arch crosses over the left mainstem bronchus.</p><p>A right aortic arch results in an indentation on the right side of the trachea. Approximately 20 percent of patients with TOF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78997\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78997 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-cyanotic-heart-disease-in-the-newborn/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and 30 percent with truncus arteriosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-cyanotic-heart-disease-in-the-newborn/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] have a right aortic arch. Because TOF is much more common than truncus arteriosus, a right aortic arch in a cyanotic infant usually suggests TOF. A right aortic arch may also be associated with other lesions, such as transposition of the great arteries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the fetus, the right ventricle has a larger volume load than the left ventricle since there is limited pulmonary flow and thus reduced blood volume in the left heart. As a result, the normal neonatal electrocardiogram (ECG) has right axis deviation (QRS axis +90 to +180 degrees) and a precordial pattern of right ventricular hypertrophy.</p><p>Although the ECG may be normal in many cyanotic heart lesions during the neonatal period, some lesions are associated with specific patterns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79941\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79941 \">table 2</a>). These include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesions associated with a small right ventricle have the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Left axis deviation for age (for pulmonary atresia intact ventricular septum typically +30 to +90 degrees; for tricuspid atresia with normally related great arteries typically -30 to -90 degrees)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Right atrial enlargement &ndash; Tall peaked P waves most easily identified in lead II</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Left ventricular hypertrophy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HLHS often has marked right ventricular hypertrophy (increased QRS voltage in the right and anterior lead) and decreased left ventricular forces in the lateral precordial leads.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ebstein anomaly has right atrial enlargement and occasionally a delta wave of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperoxia test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hyperoxia test is useful in distinguishing cardiac from pulmonary causes of cyanosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In CHD associated with intracardiac right-to-left shunting resulting in cyanosis, blood in the pulmonary veins is fully saturated with oxygen in ambient air. Administering higher concentrations of inspired oxygen increases the amount of dissolved oxygen, but has minimal effect on oxygen tension levels because there is no effect on the deoxygenated blood that is shunted to the systemic circulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, patients with pulmonary disease have pulmonary venous desaturation. Supplemental oxygen administration in pulmonary disease typically increases pulmonary venous oxygen levels and improves systemic oxygenation.</p><p/><p>In the hyperoxia test, arterial oxygen tension is measured in the right radial artery (preductal) while the patient breathes 100 percent oxygen concentration for 10 minutes. Oxygen can be administered via a hood or endotracheal tube if the patient is already intubated. A significant increase in systemic arterial oxygen saturation and partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) above 150 mmHg during the hyperoxia test makes it more likely that the patient has pulmonary disease. However, failure to increase oxygen saturation and PaO<sub>2</sub> does not definitively &quot;rule in&quot; cyanotic CHD, as severe forms of lung disease or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn may not increase the oxygen saturation and PaO<sub>2</sub> with the hyperoxic challenge.</p><p>A transcutaneous oxygen monitor can be used to assess whether arterial oxygen tension rises in response to the increased inspired oxygen concentration, thereby avoiding arterial puncture for blood sampling. However, an abnormal or equivocal response must be verified by measurement of an arterial blood gas. (See <a href=\"#H87808016\" class=\"local\">'Arterial blood gas'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-oxygen-delivery-and-oxygen-monitoring-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive oxygen delivery and oxygen monitoring in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preductal oxygen tension while breathing 100 percent oxygen concentration rarely exceeds 150 mmHg in cyanotic heart disease and usually exceeds this value in pulmonary disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54070\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54070 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-cyanotic-heart-disease-in-the-newborn/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In these cases, an echocardiogram is needed to establish the underlying diagnosis.</p><p>The level of PaO<sub>2</sub> in 100 percent oxygen also helps to distinguish among the types of cyanotic heart disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75461\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75461 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with lesions such as transposition of the great arteries or severe pulmonary outflow obstruction generally have PaO<sub>2</sub> &lt;50 to 60 mmHg during the administration of 100 percent oxygen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, in patients with mixing lesions involving both right-to-left and left-to-right shunting, such as truncus arteriosus or single ventricle with patent ductus arteriosus, the systemic oxygen tension may increase with administration of 100 percent oxygen. In these cases, supplemental oxygen may decrease pulmonary vascular resistance, thereby increasing pulmonary flow. The increased pulmonary flow mixed with a fixed amount of systemic venous return results in increased aortic oxygenation, typically to PaO<sub>2</sub> values of 75 to 150 mmHg, but rarely higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-cyanotic-heart-disease-in-the-newborn/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In these patients, the chest radiograph typically demonstrates cardiomegaly and prominent pulmonary vascularity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased oxygenation with supplemental oxygen is also seen when pulmonary disease, such as pulmonary edema or pneumonia, is associated with cyanotic CHD. However, the PaO<sub>2</sub> rarely exceeds 150 mmHg.</p><p/><p>A pulse oximeter should <strong>not</strong> be used for the hyperoxia test because it may not detect an inadequate increase in oxygen tension. Because of the characteristics of the oxygen dissociation curve, normal hemoglobin is fully saturated with oxygen when the arterial PO<sub>2</sub> exceeds 70 mmHg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59739\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59739 \">figure 2</a>). Therefore, a patient receiving 100 percent inspired oxygen concentration could have an oxygen saturation of nearly 100 percent associated with an arterial PO<sub>2</sub> of 75 mmHg, a value that is abnormal. Thus, discrimination between cardiac mixing lesions and pulmonary disease may be limited. However, pulse oximetry may be helpful if saturation remains less than 93 to 95 percent.

Patients with hypotension or poor perfusion require cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</p><p>Vital signs should be monitored and vascular access established for sampling of blood and administration of medications. Placement of secure intravenous and intra-arterial catheters is most easily accomplished via the umbilical vessels.

In most cases, cyanotic CHD is dependent upon a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) for pulmonary or systemic blood flow. Closure of the ductus arteriosus can precipitate rapid clinical deterioration with significant life-threatening changes (ie, severe metabolic acidosis, seizures, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, or end-organ injury). As a result, infants with ductal-dependent lesions are at increased risk for death and significant morbidity unless interventions are initiated to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus for ductal-dependent lesions, ensure adequate mixing of deoxygenated and oxygenated blood, or relieve obstructed blood flow.
