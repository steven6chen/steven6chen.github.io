The definition includes the following hemodynamic parameters: persistent hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;80 to 90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure 30 mmHg lower than baseline) with severe reduction in the cardiac index (&lt;1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> per m<sup>2</sup> without support or &lt;2 to 2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> per m<sup>2</sup> with support) and adequate or elevated filling pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Short-term prognosis is directly related to the severity of the hemodynamic disorder and patients most commonly succumb to multiorgan dysfunction due to ongoing organ hypoperfusion.</p><p>The most common etiology of CS is an acute myocardial infarction (usually ST elevation myocardial infarction) with left ventricular failure, but it can also be caused by mechanical complications, such as acute mitral regurgitation or rupture of either the ventricular septal or free walls. However, any cause of acute, severe left or right ventricular dysfunction may lead to CS.</p><p>The prognosis and therapy of CS complicating acute myocardial infarction (MI) will be reviewed here. The larger discussion of the causes of CS, other presentations that mimic CS secondary to MI, as well as the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cardiogenic shock in acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Temporal trends</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of cardiogenic shock (CS) appears to be falling since the mid-1970s. In a report from one United States metropolitan area (Worcester, Massachusetts), the incidence of CS was around 7 percent between 1975 and 1990 and has decreased to between 5.5 to 6.0 percent since then [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The historic mortality rate for CS complicating an acute myocardial infarction (MI) was 80 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, lower values for in-hospital mortality have been noted in more studies, ranging from 48 to 74 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9</a>]. Studies have suggested short-term mortality rates between 42 and 48 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9,10</a>].</p><p>Two reports from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction showed evidence of continued improvement in mortality from CS between 1994 and 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Similar findings were noted in an analysis of over 23,000 acute coronary syndrome patients in a Swiss registry (1997 to 2006) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Data published from the large CathPCI Registry reported an increase in in-hospital mortality in patients treated with PCI from 27.6 percent (2005 to 2006) to 30.6 percent in 2011 to 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The decrease in the incidence of shock and the associated improvement in overall mortality in part reflect increased use of coronary reperfusion strategies, particularly primary percutaneous coronary intervention, which, by restoring patency to the infarct-related artery, can limit infarct size and improves survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/5-7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7,13</a>]. In contrast, rates of performance of coronary artery bypass (CABG) have not increased despite the high rate of multivessel disease in patients who develop cardiogenic shock and the potential of CABG surgery to provide complete revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The lack of utilization of CABG in appropriate patients may account in part for a plateau in the mortality rate. </p><p>Long-term survival in patients with myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock is improved with timely revascularization in the acute setting, and functional status and quality of life in survivors are excellent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Predictors of mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of studies have attempted to identify risk factors for mortality in CS. An analysis from the GUSTO-I database identified the following predictors of 30-day survival for patients with CS complicating an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who receive initial fibrinolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing age (odds ratio 1.49 for each 10 year increase)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior MI</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical findings at the time of diagnosis (the presence of altered sensorium and cold, clammy skin)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oliguria</p><p/><p>Hemodynamic parameters (including basic vital signs and measurements obtained from pulmonary artery catheterization) also correlate with mortality in patients with CS. These parameters include mean arterial pressure (MAP), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cardiac output (CO), and cardiac index, with cardiac power index (MAP x <span class=\"nowrap\">CO/451</span> x body surface area in m<sup>2</sup>) being the strongest hemodynamic predictor on multivariate analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The observational CardShock study, conducted between 2010 and 2015, and which included patients with either MI and non-MI etiologies of cardiogenic shock, demonstrated that advanced age, a history of MI or CABG surgery, altered mental status, low LV ejection fraction, low estimated glomerular filtration rate, and high blood lactate levels were independently associated with increased in-hospital&nbsp;mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">STEMI versus NSTEMI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mortality rate in patients in CS in GUSTO-IIb was similar in those with STEMI or non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although CS was significantly less common with non-ST elevation infarcts (2.5 versus 4.2 percent, odds ratio 0.58), patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes were older and more likely to have three vessel disease and diabetes mellitus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Coronary anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with CS complicating an acute MI have severe and extensive coronary disease. In the SHOCK trial registry, for example, 16 percent of those who underwent angiography had significant left main disease and 53 percent had three vessel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Mortality varied significantly with the location of the culprit lesion and was noted to be higher in patients with a left main or saphenous vein graft lesion than in those with circumflex, left anterior descending, or right coronary artery lesions (79 and 70 percent versus 37 to 42 percent). Right coronary culprit lesions were associated with the best prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Echocardiographic predictors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a substudy from the SHOCK trial, 169 patients had echocardiograms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The only independent echocardiographic predictors of outcome were left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and severity of mitral regurgitation (MR). For those with an LVEF &lt;28 percent, survival at one year was 24 percent (versus 56 percent for those with a higher LVEF). For those with moderate or severe MR, survival at one year was 31 percent (versus 58 percent for those with mild or no MR). However, there was benefit of early revascularization at all levels of LVEF and MR grade.

An analysis of 80 such patients who were in CS showed that in-hospital mortality was only 6.2 percent in patients reperfused within two hours of symptom onset; this was more likely to occur in patients diagnosed with MI in the prehospital arena [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Four hundred and ninety-nine patients with record of systemic hypoperfusion status from the SHOCK trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] were evaluated for relationship between rapid reversal (&lt;30 minutes) of hypoperfusion and 30-day and one-year mortality. After adjusting for important predictors of outcome, there remained a significant association between complete reversal of hypoperfusion and 30-day mortality (odds ratio 0.18, CI 0.08-0.42) and one-year mortality (odds ratio 0.28, CI 0.12-0.67). Of note, 85 percent of patients in the SHOCK trial were supported with IABP. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">After successful reperfusion therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early successful reperfusion therapy, particularly with percutaneous coronary intervention, improves outcomes compared with conservative (medical) therapy. The magnitude of this benefit is discussed below.

Thus, if possible, correction of these metabolic disturbances is important (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82406\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82406 \">table 1</a>). In addition, shock in the setting of myocardial infarction (MI) may be caused by factors not directly related to the MI. These include hypovolemia, use of blood pressure lowering drugs, rate slowing drugs, and other types of cardiovascular disease; they are discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

Even though heparin has not been evaluated in CS, there are compelling reasons that full-dose intravenous heparin therapy should be given. Patients in shock are in a low flow state with high fibrinogen concentrations. As a result, they are at risk for left ventricular and deep vein thrombosis. Heparin may also maintain coronary artery patency.

Randomization to eptifibatide did not affect the incidence of shock. However, in patients who were treated with eptifibatide and developed shock, compared to those receiving placebo, a significantly reduced incidence of death at 30 days was noted (48 versus 58 percent in patients without an MI and 69 versus 85 percent in patients with an MI). A possible mechanism of benefit is relief of microvascular obstruction.</p><p>Another possible mechanism for benefit is the possible therapeutic effect of GP <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> inhibitors in patients with an STEMI and CS who undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Evidence for this recommendation comes from the COMMIT trial in which randomization to early beta blockade was associated with a 30 percent higher occurrence of cardiogenic shock in patients over the age of 70, those with systolic blood pressure (BP) &lt;120 mm Hg or presenting heart rate greater than 110 beats per minute, and those with Killip Class &gt;1.

In a trial of 1679 patients with circulatory shock due to varying etiologies (septic, hypovolemic, and CS) who were randomly assigned to initial therapy with either dopamine or norepinephrine, there was a trend toward higher rate of death at 28 days with dopamine and there were significantly more arrhythmias, predominantly atrial fibrillation. There was no difference in the treatment effect based on shock type, including in the subset of 280 patients with cardiogenic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>There is insufficient evidence upon which a firm recommendation for the choice of the first vasopressor or inotrope in patients with cardiogenic shock can be made.

Outcomes are better when successful reperfusion can be delivered early in the course of myocardial infarction (MI). However, benefit is derived as late as 24 hours after CS onset, and shock onset can occur quite late following MI onset.

In a report of 200 patients from Duke, for example, the in-hospital mortality was much lower in patients with a patent compared to a closed infarct-related artery (33 versus 75 percent); this relationship was independent of how patency was achieved (eg, spontaneous or pharmacologic fibrinolysis or mechanical intervention) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

There are limited randomized data assessing the efficacy of fibrinolysis compared to either placebo or PCI in patients who have CS at presentation. The available studies have demonstrated some benefit of fibrinolysis compared to placebo, but superiority of PCI or CABG compared to fibrinolysis. Fibrinolysis is recommended if PCI is not possible or if it is significantly delayed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibrinolysis-for-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-initiation-of-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibrinolysis for acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Initiation of therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The 1994 meta-analysis from the Fibrinolytic Therapy Trialists' (FTT) Collaborative Group found that, among patients with a systolic blood pressure &lt;100 mmHg and a heart rate &gt;100 beats per minute, fibrinolysis was associated with a 7 percent absolute reduction in mortality at one month compared to control (54 versus 61 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The apparently limited efficacy of fibrinolysis may have reflected failure to augment coronary perfusion pressure during administration of the fibrinolytic agent. In animal studies, the rate of dissolution of a coronary artery thrombus by fibrinolytic therapy is markedly depressed when hypotension is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. </p><p>In a post-hoc analysis of the SHOCK trial, the use of fibrinolytic therapy was associated with a significant reduction in mortality at 12 months (60 versus 78 percent without fibrinolysis) in the group assigned to medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Based upon the apparent benefit in those who did not receive immediate revascularization and the absence of adverse effects in those who underwent invasive procedures, fibrinolytic therapy should be given to patients who present to a facility without primary PCI or timely transfer for primary PCI capability, particularly those who present within three hours of symptoms. However, all patients should be transferred to a PCI-capable facility as soon as possible.

The benefits of early revascularization in patients with CS were confirmed in the 1999 SHOCK trial, a randomized comparison of emergency revascularization versus a strategy of initial medical stabilization including fibrinolysis and intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) in patients with an STEMI (or new left bundle branch block) and CS. </p><p>The trial included 302 patients with confirmed CS developing within 36 hours of an acute MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The patients were randomly assigned within 12 hours of the diagnosis of shock to emergency revascularization (CABG in 40 percent and PCI in 60 percent) within six hours of randomization or to initial medical stabilization. Almost half of the patients assigned to emergency revascularization had had prior fibrinolysis, and therefore underwent rescue PCI or CABG; 63 percent of patients in the medical arm also received fibrinolytic therapy. Late revascularization was performed in 25 percent of patients in the medical stabilization arm at a minimum of 54 hours after randomization at the discretion of the local physician. Intraaortic balloon counterpulsation was utilized in 86 percent of patients in both groups.</p><p>At 30 days, there was an insignificant 9 percent absolute difference in total mortality (primary end point) between the two treatment groups (47 versus 56 percent with initial medical therapy with fibrinolysis); the lack of significance could represent beta error since the trial was underpowered to detect such a difference. The benefit increased over time and became significant at six months.

However, in the SHOCK trial and registry, patients in shock on admission derived the same in-hospital mortality benefit from emergency revascularization (60 versus 82 percent) as those who developed shock later (46 versus 62 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Late shock'</a> above.)</p><p>For CS patients who undergo PCI, the target of revascularization is the culprit lesion(s) in the infarct-related artery. The issue of whether nonculprit stenoses should be treated has been debated. Revascularization of these nonculprit lesions is recommended for MI patients without CS, and the timing of PCI of these lesions is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-non-culprit-lesions#H625058030\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary percutaneous coronary intervention in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction: Non-culprit lesions&quot;, section on 'Our approach'</a>.)</p><p>With regard to the issue of whether nonculprit lesions in patients with CS should undergo PCI, a 2017 meta-analysis of 10 cohort studies that included over 6000 patients with CS showed a higher mortality with multivessel PCI than with culprit-lesion-only PCI (37.5 versus 28.8 percent; p = 0.001) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The CULPRIT-SHOCK trial, published after the meta-analysis, randomly assigned 706 patients with both STEMI and NSTEMI with CS to PCI of the culprit lesion only, with the option of stage revascularization of nonculprit lesions or immediate multivessel PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. At 30 days, the primary end point (a composite of death or renal failure leading to renal-replacement therapy) occurred less often in the culprit-lesion-only group (45.9 versus 55.4 percent; relative risk 0.83, 95% CI 0.71-0.96). The secondary end point of the relative risk of death was also lower (0.84, 95% CI 0.72-0.98). Staged revascularization was performed in 17.7 percent of the culprit-lesion-only group.

While some patients improve rapidly after PCI, others show no immediate hemodynamic improvement, and a few transiently deteriorate after reperfusion is established, particularly if there is late reperfusion. This is also true for late reperfusion with fibrinolysis. Concurrent use of an IABP protects against sudden hemodynamic deterioration. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Intraaortic balloon pump'</a> above.)</p><p>Data from the nonrandomized SHOCK trial registry suggest that the in-hospital mortality after PCI is related to the degree of reperfusion achieved in the infarct related artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Among 276 patients undergoing PCI, the mortality for TIMI grade 3 (normal), grade 2, or grade <span class=\"nowrap\">0/1</span> flow was 33, 50, and 86 percent, respectively. A similar relationship to TIMI flow grade was noted in a report from the ALKK primary PCI registry in Germany (37, 66, and 78 percent in-hospital mortality, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

In the ALKK report, the in-hospital mortality was 44 percent in patients receiving primary and rescue PCI as well as urgent CABG within three hours from symptom onset, 45 percent from three to six hours, 54 percent from 6 to 12 hours, and 58 percent from 12 to 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

As a result, late presenters should not be denied emergency revascularization based upon timing alone. (See <a href=\"#H32\" class=\"local\">'PCI'</a> above.)</p><p>In a prespecified subset analysis of the SHOCK trial, the benefit of revascularization on survival was limited to patients &lt;75 years old, but there were too few elderly patients in this subgroup to be confident of the observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Although emergent CABG is a revascularization option, it appears to be seldom utilized in contemporary clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Potential efficacy of PCI in patients with CS and left main disease was suggested in an observational registry of unprotected left main stenosis; 40 patients with an acute MI (37 of whom had CS) underwent emergency PCI (17 with stenting) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. The rate of in-hospital death (35 versus 70 percent) was lower in those who received a stent compared to primary balloon angioplasty alone. Stenting was also associated with a higher survival rate at 12 months (53 versus 35 percent). A much higher in-hospital mortality rate of 81 percent was noted after primary PCI among 80 patients with a left main stem infarct-related artery in the ALKK primary PCI registry in Germany [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

In such patients, the ability to achieve complete revascularization makes CABG a potentially critical therapeutic strategy. A surgical approach also permits the correction of concomitant severe mitral regurgitation, which is often present. Pooled data on 370 patients in 22 studies revealed an in-hospital mortality rate of 36 percent when CABG was performed during the hospitalization for acute MI with CS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Despite this benefit, CABG is underutilized in the community setting. In a review from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction of 25,311 patients with CS seen from 1995 to 2004 in the United States, the overall rate of immediate CABG was stable at about 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h3\">PCI versus CABG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relative efficacy of PCI and CABG was evaluated in the 128 patients with predominant left ventricular failure who underwent emergency revascularization in the SHOCK trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Not surprisingly, the 47 patients (37 percent) who underwent CABG were significantly more likely to have diabetes and three-vessel or left main disease; 85 percent of these patients received two or more grafts and 52 percent received three or more grafts. Despite the more extensive disease in the CABG group, overall survival was similar to PCI at 30 days (57 versus 56 percent with PCI) and one year (47 versus 52 percent). The similar outcomes, despite the worse disease in patients undergoing CABG, may reflect in part the higher rate of complete revascularization (87 versus 23 percent with PCI).</p><p>In clinical practice, a combination of these two revascularization strategies is often indicated.
