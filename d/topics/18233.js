Ultrasound examination is an effective modality for the prenatal diagnosis of these anomalies. An accurate fetal diagnosis depends upon a precise description of the sonographic appearance of the CNS and careful evaluation for associated malformations, which are often present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A thorough understanding of the normal sonographic appearance of the CNS at different gestational ages is crucial for accurate diagnosis because the presence or absence of a structure may be deemed normal or abnormal depending upon the age of the fetus.</p><p>As an example, a sonogram of the fetal brain at 14 weeks of gestation cannot detect agenesis of the corpus callosum since this structure does not become sonographically apparent until 18 to 20 weeks of gestation and does not acquire its final form until 28 to 30 weeks. In another example, a population-based study of 55,226 pregnancies reported 143 infants with CNS defects, 85 of whom had a prenatal sonogram at 16 to 20 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The diagnosis of CNS abnormality was made prenatally in 64 (75 percent), not made in 17 (20 percent), and was questionable in 4 (5 percent). Poor timing of the examination, rather than poor sensitivity, was the most important factor in failing to detect a CNS defect.</p><p>Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound plays an important role in the evaluation of brain anomalies since it has the potential for further characterization of these defects. Multiplanar imaging of the brain, as well as use of a variety of display modalities, such as tomographic imaging, inversion, maximum-mode, surface rendering, and volume scanning, allows the sonologist to obtain planes and sections not easily obtainable with conventional two-dimensional (2D) sonography. The pediatric neurologist or neurosurgeon can use this additional information when counseling parents about prognosis and clinical management options.</p><p>Fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can also be used to image the fetus. However, we feel that ultrasonography continues to be the modality of choice in the evaluation of a fetus at risk for a neural tube defect (NTD), given its high detection rates (see below). Prenatal screening and diagnosis of NTDs, as well as prevention, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-neural-tube-defects-risk-factors-prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-and-pregnancy-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open neural tube defects: Risk factors, prenatal screening and diagnosis, and pregnancy management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-supplementation-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Folic acid supplementation in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Amniocentesis for genetic studies (eg, DNA microarray) should be offered when NTDs are identified, as these fetuses have a 5 to 7 percent rate of aneuploidy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. The incidence of chromosomal abnormalities is as high as 20 percent in fetuses with major CNS abnormalities plus other congenital anomalies; however, the incidence falls to about 1 to 2 percent when NTDs are isolated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-genetic-evaluation-of-the-anomalous-fetus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal genetic evaluation of the anomalous fetus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The sonographic diagnosis of neural tube defects (NTDs) will be reviewed here. Isolated fetal ventriculomegaly and other CNS lesions are discussed separately.

It appears to be the embryologic predecessor of anencephaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/7-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-13</a>]. In-utero diagnosis requires careful examination of both the fetal cranium and brain. </p><p>The integrity of the fetal cranium can be assessed with sonography from the first trimester since ossification of cranial bone has begun [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The first trimester exencephalic fetus has an abnormal head shape with sonolucent spaces within the exposed and disintegrating brain due to the absence of the cranial vault. The outer shape of the exposed brain may be bilobed since the exposed two hemispheres fall to the side; this appearance has been called &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; head (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72765\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72765 \">image 1</a>). Exencephaly has been detected as early as the 10th postmenstrual week.</p><p>In the second trimester, the usual appearance of the cranium encasing the brain is lost. The exposed brain has a heterogeneous appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61919\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61919 \">image 2</a>) and is not covered by the cranium. Although the cranial vault is absent, the fetal facial bones can be clearly visualized.</p><p>Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels are highly elevated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANENCEPHALY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anencephaly is the most common NTD, occurring in approximately 1 per 1000 births prior to the era of routine prenatal screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. More recently (2009), anencephaly was reported in only 1 in 10,000 births in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. It is characterized by absence of the brain and lack of the cranial vault due to failure of the rostral neuropore to close during the 24th to 26th day post conception (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71153%7EOBGYN%2F50131\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71153 graphicRef50131 \">image 3A-B</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anencephaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anencephaly&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The anencephalic fetus can be definitively identified by the 12<sup>th</sup> postmenstrual week by TVS, although in some cases this diagnosis has been made as early as 9 to 10 postmenstrual weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Early diagnosis can be made if the cranium is examined carefully at the time of nuchal translucency measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>A relatively early and indirect sonographic sign of <span class=\"nowrap\">anencephaly/exencephaly</span> sequence is a significant amount of low-level echogenic, particulate matter containing amniotic fluid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71153\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71153 \">image 3A</a>). This results from the &quot;rubbing off&quot; of the exposed neural tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Measurement of the crown-chin length and the ratio of the crown-chin to crown-rump length (CRL) at 10 to 14 postmenstrual weeks is also useful in the early recognition of anencephaly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54289\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54289 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Ultrasound is able to provide a decisive diagnosis of the <span class=\"nowrap\">anencephaly/exencephaly</span> sequence; magnetic resonance imaging does not enhance diagnostic certainty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Dystrophic exposed brain tissue may be observed early in pregnancy, but disappears later in gestation. The fetal face from the orbits to the chin is usually normal, but there is no skull above the orbits anteriorly and above the cervical spine posteriorly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50131\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50131 \">image 3B</a>). Polyhydramnios develops in up to 50 percent of the cases during the second and third trimester due to decreased fetal swallowing, but is not present during the first trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/8,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,25-27</a>]. Craniorachischisis (congenital incomplete closure of the skull and spine) is observed in less than 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Fetal activity is not significantly impaired.</p><p>Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels are highly elevated.</p><p>Up to 75 percent of anencephalic fetuses are stillborn with the remainder dying shortly after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In the last two decades, due to the widespread use of prenatal ultrasound, the birth of neonate with an unexpected and undiagnosed anencephaly is extremely rare. Preterm labor and delivery may occur from uterine over distention due to polyhydramnios or the pregnancy may extend postterm because absence of fetal brain precludes normal pathways in the fetus' initiation of labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Delivery is usually induced given the uniformly lethal prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Management of twins where one twin is anencephalic is more complicated. The embryology, clinical features, recurrence risk, and management of anencephaly are reviewed separately.

The occipital, frontal, parietal, orbital, nasal, or nasopharyngeal region of the head can be involved, but most occur posteriorly. </p><p>The typical sonographic appearance of cephalocele is a defect of the bony skull with a protruding sac-like structure.

For example, MRI is better at visualizing some brain malformations, such as migrational anomalies, which are not seen well on ultrasound.</p><p>Cephalocele can be diagnosed at 11 to 14 weeks during sonographic screening for aneuploidy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. </p><p>Cephalocele usually occurs as an isolated lesion, but may be a part of a syndrome such as Meckel (or Meckel-Gruber) or Walker-Warburg syndrome in a small percentage of cases. Both syndromes are autosomal recessive. Cephaloceles also can occur in association with aneuploidy; therefore, fetal microarray should be offered.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classical triad of Meckel syndrome is occipital cephalocele (present in 80 percent), bilateral polycystic kidneys, and post-axial polydactyly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Prenatal diagnosis of Meckel-Gruber syndrome has been made in the first and early second trimesters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/43-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-49</a>].

There is an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities with NTDs so determining the fetal microarray should be offered. </p><p>In a retrospective review of cases of cephalocele diagnosed in the first trimester, attention was given to the location, size and content of defects. Of the 35 affected fetuses identified, there were 33 singleton and two twin pregnancies with an unaffected co-fetus. There were cranial meningoceles in 13 (37 percent) and an encephalocele in 22 cases (63 percent). Occipital bone defect was seen in 27 (77 percent), three frontal (9 percent), three parietal (9 percent) and non-classifiable in 2 (6 percent) cases. There were 12 (34 percent) small in size, 11 (31 percent) were medium, and 12 (34 percent) were large. There were no cases of aneuploidy. Four (11 percent) cases were associated with Meckel-Gruber syndrome, two (6 percent) with a disruptive syndrome, and one (3 percent) with skeletal dysplasia. Twenty-three percent of pregnancies were lost to follow-up. Termination of pregnancy was performed in 21 of the 27 remaining cases; four miscarried or the fetus died in utero. One liveborn infant died shortly after delivery and one underwent neonatal surgery for an isolated cranial meningocele and is currently doing well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Classification, embryology, inheritance, clinical features, management, and outcome of encephalocele are reviewed separately.

Associated malformations occur in up to 84 percent of cases and include hydrocephaly, microcephaly, ventricular atresia, holoprosencephaly, polymicrogyria, agenesis of the cerebellar vermis, occipital encephalocele, diaphragmatic hernia, thoracic cage deformities, urinary tract anomalies, cleft lip and palate, omphalocele, and polyhydramnios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/52,54,55,61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,54,55,61,62</a>].

It is therefore useful to be familiar with their pathologic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SPINAL DYSRAPHISM AND THE ARNOLD-CHIARI MALFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal dysraphism or spina bifida refers to protrusion of the spinal contents through a bony defect in the spine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78078%7EOBGYN%2F58063\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78078 graphicRef58063 \">image 7A-B</a>). The abnormality probably results from maldevelopment occurring at the fourth week of gestation: the bony sheath surrounding the spinal cord does not form properly due to failure of the posterior vertebral arches to close. Associated brain abnormalities include hydrocephaly, relative microcephaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and diastematomyelia. Non-CNS anomalies consist of congenital scoliosis or kyphosis and hip deformities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. There is a high prevalence of genetic abnormalities among fetuses with NTDs, especially in the presence of other congenital anomalies so microarray should be offered.

Myelocele is a midline plaque of neural tissue (neural placode) that is flush with the fetal surface and not covered by skin. In contrast, myelomeningocele refers to a bulging defect in which the elevated neural plate and meninges are contiguous laterally with the subcutaneous tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67038\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67038 \">image 8</a>).</p><p>Ten to 15 percent of spinal dysraphic defects are closed by normal skin covering the bony defect. The remainder are open and most are detectable by maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening. Approximately 80 percent of lesions occur in the lumbar, thoracolumbar, or lumbosacral areas of the spine, with the remainder in the cervical and sacral areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>The diagnostic sensitivity of prenatal sonography for detection of myelomeningocele in a high risk population is about 97 to 98 percent with 100 percent specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-69</a>].

The centers of the neural arches are parallel, with gradual widening toward the fetal head and tapering at the sacrum. Spina bifida appears as widening of the ossification centers in the coronal plane and as a divergence of the ossification centers in the transverse plane (U-shaped vertebrae). In addition, a cystic sac may be visualized if the fetus has a myelomeningocele (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67038\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef67038 \">image 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78078\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78078 \">image 7A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58063\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58063 \">image 7B</a>).</p><p>In the second trimester, well-established sonographic findings of the fetal head (eg, lemon sign, banana sign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>], and hydrocephaly) facilitate detection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81929%7EOBGYN%2F64380\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81929 graphicRef64380 \">image 9A-B</a>). A detailed ultrasound scan of the spine in the sagittal and transverse planes is indicated if these cranial findings have been observed. The sagittal view shows irregularities of the bony spine, a bulging within the posterior contour of the fetal back, or obvious disruption of the fetal skin contours. Transverse sections reveal open vertebrae with a U-shape. The coronal section of the affected bony segment shows a divergent configuration replacing the normal parallel lines of the normal vertebral arches. The presence of both indirect cranial findings (small posterior fossa, enlarged foramen magnum, downward herniation of cerebellar tonsils and vermis) and a spinal defect is termed the Arnold-Chiari type ll malformation.</p><p>The banana and lemon signs are generally not present in the first trimester, but may become apparent early in the second trimester. As an example, one fetus who was serially scanned from 10 weeks of gestation had a normal cerebellum initially, mild convexity of the cerebellum by 12 postmenstrual weeks, and typical banana and lemon signs by 14 postmenstrual weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Although cases of lumbosacral spina bifida with an associated lemon sign have been reported at 12 to 14 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>], these findings may be subtle or absent in the first trimester, thus a follow-up scan later in the second trimester is indicated when spina bifida is suspected.</p><p>In a retrospective study including over 600 fetuses with spina bifida between 18 and 22 weeks of gestation, the banana and lemon signs were evident in 97.1 and 88.6 percent of cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. In addition, 96.7 percent had obliteration of the cisterna magna. After 24 weeks, the prevalence of the banana and lemon signs falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. </p><p>The Arnold-Chiari type ll malformation is present in almost every case of thoracolumbar, lumbar, and lumbosacral myelomeningocele. The hydrocephaly probably results from a hindbrain malformation that blocks flow of cerebrospinal fluid through the fourth ventricle or posterior fossa, or from aqueductal stenosis, which is present in 40 to 75 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p>Spina bifida can be detected before 12 weeks of gestation by noting irregularities of the bony spine or a bulging within the posterior contour of the fetal back (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66541\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66541 \">image 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>]. Abnormalities of the posterior half of the fetal brain, including absence of visualization of the intracranial translucency (IT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75261\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75261 \">image 11</a>), non-visualization of the cisterna magna, and posterior shift of the brainstem towards the occipital bone have also been described as early signs of open spina bifida [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/79-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-81</a>]. In one study, four observers reviewed first-trimester ultrasound images obtained for measurement of nuchal translucency from 52 cases of open spina bifida and 208 normal fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. An abnormal posterior half of the brain presenting at least one of these three criteria was associated with detection rates ranging from 50 to 90 percent for the four observers. Retrospective studies have shown that a normal IT has a high specificity for ruling out open spina bifida (99 percent). In another study, the three anechoic spaces in the posterior brain (brainstem, intracranial translucency and cisterna magna) on the median plane of fetuses between 11 and 14 weeks were analyzed retrospectively to predict fetal outcome when one of the above posterior brain anatomical space is not recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. The study included 311 healthy fetuses with a normal sonogram and 21 fetuses with absence of one of the three posterior brain spaces. All fetuses with absence of one of the three posterior brain spaces had a severe anomaly, such as open spina bifida, cephalocele, Dandy-Walker sequence, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chromosomal aberrations. Large prospective studies are still necessary to ascertain the real value of these new signs. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are scant data regarding prognostically useful sonographic features of fetuses with NTDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/84-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-87</a>]. The most important predictor of functional neurological outcome in spina bifida appears to be the level of the lesion, which can be approximated prenatally. Combined data from two series (n = 28 and 33 cases) showed that prenatal sonographic and postnatal assessment were concordant within one vertebral segment in 79 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>], within two vertebral segments in 92 percent of patients, and within three vertebral segments in 100 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. The latter study also found that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesion level was most predictive of ambulatory function. All infants with thoracic lesions or myeloschisis were nonambulatory upon assessment at age 1 to 5 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sonography was not useful for predicting future need for shunt placement, but almost all of the subjects eventually required this procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesion type was correctly identified sonographically in all cases.</p><p/><p>This study did not evaluate postnatal urologic and bowel function, and mental capacity, which are other important functional outcomes.</p><p>Others have reported that prenatal sonographic lesion level predicted postnatal neuromuscular function &quot;equal to or better than that expected&quot; in 10 of 11 patients (91 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>] or &quot;equal to that expected&quot; in 12 of 15 patients (80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. </p><p>The outcome of prenatally diagnosed myelomeningocele has also been correlated with findings on magnetic resonance imaging. A review of 36 pregnancies complicated by fetal myelomeningocele, referred for fetal MRI at mean gestational age 27 &plusmn; 6 weeks, and followed postnatally at a spina bifida treatment center reported the following findings at follow-up at 2.4 to 5.1 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher lesion levels were associated with dysphagia: T-L2 (50 percent), L3-4 (45 percent), L5-S (13 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The absence of covering membrane was associated with scoliosis (36 versus 0 percent with membrane present) and with high-risk bladder dysfunction (71 versus 36 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher lesion level, larger segment span, and interpediculate distance greater than 10 mm were associated with full-time wheelchair use.</p><p/><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of myelomeningocele (spina bifida)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of myelomeningocele (spina bifida)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">FETAL ACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetuses with neural tube defects or central nervous system abnormalities typically remain active; however, the quality of fetal movement is often different from that in normal fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasound-diagnosis-of-neural-tube-defects/abstract/90-94\" class=\"abstract_t\">90-94</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Anencephaly'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cephaloceles (eg, encephalocele) are cranial defects through which the brain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> meninges have herniated outside of the skull. Cephalocele usually occurs as an isolated lesion, but may be a part of a syndrome such as Meckel (or Meckel-Gruber) syndrome or Walker-Warburg syndrome or due to amniotic bands. Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound examination may aid in diagnosis. Microarray should be offered, given the high risk of aneuploidy.
