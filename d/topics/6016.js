The associated urinary losses of albumin and hormone-binding proteins are responsible for many of the metabolic derangements and endocrine abnormalities in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic review will emphasize the alterations in thyroid, vitamin D, and calcium metabolism. The effects on lipid metabolism are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipid-abnormalities-in-nephrotic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipid abnormalities in nephrotic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">THYROID FUNCTION TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid function tests reveal variable results in the nephrotic syndrome, primarily depending upon the level of protein losses in the urine. In addition, other factors that are frequently present in patients with the nephrotic syndrome, such as hypoalbuminemia, increased serum free fatty acid concentrations, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> administration, can also affect thyroid function tests&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory assessment of thyroid function&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Although there are no data, it is reasonable to test thyroid function when nephrotic syndrome is first diagnosed, and then perform serial testing (at least annually) in patients who remain nephrotic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Relatively normal glomerular filtration rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary losses of thyroxine (T4)-binding globulin (TBG) and other thyroid hormone-binding proteins (transthyretin and albumin) and the T4 bound to them result in a low total T4 concentrations in approximately 50 percent of nephrotic patients with a relatively normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Serum triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations may also be low due also to decreased binding. There is often a good correlation between the serum T4 and T3 and the serum albumin concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Serum reverse T3 (rT3) concentrations are also low.</p><p>Despite these changes, nephrotic patients are usually clinically euthyroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory assessment of thyroid function&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physiologically important serum free T4 and T3 concentrations are normal, as are serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The serum <span class=\"nowrap\">T3/T4</span> ratio is typically normal, suggesting no impairment in the conversion of T4 to T3 and therefore a normal rate of production of T3.</p><p/><p>As a result, thyroid hormone replacement is not typically required in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, occasional patients with nephrotic syndrome who have limited thyroid reserve or are taking fixed doses of T4 may become hypothyroid due to loss of T4 in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Congenital nephrotic syndrome is associated with hypothyroidism in view of massive urinary protein losses, and bilateral nephrectomy has led to correction of thyroid abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When impaired renal function complicates the nephrotic syndrome, the thyroid function test abnormalities are often more severe than when either renal failure or the nephrotic syndrome is present alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. If hypothyroidism is suspected clinically in such a patient, serum TSH should be measured. However, most patients remain clinically euthyroid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-function-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid function in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-function-in-nonthyroidal-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyroid function in nonthyroidal illness&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids, which are often given to treat the nephrotic syndrome, can cause a small reduction in TSH secretion and inhibit the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3. The net effect may be persistently low serum T3 and basal serum TSH concentrations, and a rise in serum rT3 concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, the serum free T4 concentrations may be the best marker of thyroid status. Patients with low serum free T4 concentrations probably should be treated as if they were hypothyroid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6339139\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney disease associated with thyroid dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some causes of nephrotic syndrome are associated with autoimmune thyroid disease. Membranous nephropathy, for example, has been associated with both autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and Graves' disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Antithyroid antibodies have been reported in the glomerular immune deposits in Graves' disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and in this particular case, thyroidectomy was associated with disappearance of antithyroid antibodies, reduction of proteinuria (but not complete remission), and stabilization of GFR. Conversely, treatment of patients with Graves' disease with radioactive iodine has been associated with the appearance of membranous nephropathy and proliferative glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The mechanisms linking diseases of the kidney and thyroid are not clear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">VITAMIN D AND CALCIUM METABOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nephrotic syndrome is associated with urinary loss of vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP), a 59-kDa protein that is filtered more easily by nephrotic glomeruli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In serum, calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D), the precursor of the most active metabolite calcitriol, is primarily bound to VDBP and is therefore also excreted in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-d#H1172644\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin D&quot;, section on 'Metabolism'</a>). The net effect is a reduction in serum calcidiol concentrations, while those of calcitriol are normal or reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/20,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22,23</a>]. However, the physiologically important serum free calcidiol concentration is usually normal, suggesting that reduced total concentrations are due to loss of hormone bound to VDBP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The physiologic consequences of these changes in vitamin D metabolism on calcium homeostasis are uncertain. Hypocalcemia is a common finding in the nephrotic syndrome, due primarily to hypoalbuminemia-induced reduction in calcium binding to albumin. In general, the serum total calcium concentration will fall approximately 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> for every 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> reduction in serum albumin concentration. A low serum total calcium concentration induced by hypoalbuminemia does not affect the physiologically important free (or ionized) calcium concentration. Thus, measurement of the ionized calcium concentration is generally required to confirm hypocalcemia in nephrotic patients with a low total serum calcium.</p><p>Alternatively, the measured serum calcium concentration can be corrected for the presence of hypoalbuminemia from the following equation:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Corrected [Ca] &#160; = &#160; Measured total [Ca] &#160;+ &#160;0.8 &#160;x &#160;(4.5 &#160;- &#160;[alb])</p></div></div><p>where the serum calcium and albumin concentrations are measured in units of <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> respectively. Thus, if the measured values are 7.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL:</span></p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Corrected [Ca] &#160; = &#160; 7.6 &#160;+ &#160;0.8 &#160;x &#160;2 &#160; = &#160; 9.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p></div></div><p>A subset of patients has been reported with hypocalcemia out of proportion to hypoalbuminemia, due to low serum calcitriol concentrations. These patients have a decline in ionized calcium concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>] and a secondary elevation in serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The hyperparathyroidism can then lead to bone disease characterized by mixed osteomalacia and osteitis fibrosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A review of the histologic changes that may be seen can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-biopsy-and-the-diagnosis-of-renal-osteodystrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone biopsy and the diagnosis of renal osteodystrophy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The frequency with which true hypocalcemia and bone disease occurs in the nephrotic syndrome is unclear, as many investigators have found relatively normal calcium and bone metabolism. One report, for example, evaluated six adults with the nephrotic syndrome and normal renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Although serum calcidiol concentrations were reduced, the serum ionized calcium, calcitriol, and PTH concentrations were normal, and there was no histologic evidence of bone disease. Other investigators have also noted normal intestinal calcium absorption and bone histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>In summary, only a subset of patients with the nephrotic syndrome develops clinically important abnormalities in vitamin D, calcium, and bone metabolism. Suggested predisposing factors include increasing age, prolonged duration of disease, renal insufficiency, marked proteinuria, and glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Another possibility which has been demonstrated in experimental animals is impaired production of calcitriol due to tubular damage induced by heavy proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vitamin D replacement therapy (with ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol) is not routinely recommended in patients with the nephrotic syndrome. It may, however, be beneficial in patients with unremitting or relapsing nephrotic syndrome who have persistent reductions in serum ionized calcium concentrations. </p><p>If vitamin D is given, oral therapy is probably sufficient. Studies in experimental animals with the nephrotic syndrome have found that calcidiol absorption is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Similar findings have been noted in humans. In one study, for example, oral administration of calcidiol to nephrotic patients resulted in sustained normalization of the serum calcidiol concentrations and, if renal function was normal, calcitriol; these changes were accompanied by correction of the low serum ionized calcium concentrations and of secondary hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Patients with the nephrotic syndrome who develop chronic renal failure will often be at an increased risk for vitamin D-related bone disease due to the associated reduction in calcitriol synthesis. This is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The effects of the chronic administration of glucocorticoids on bone mineral density in children with the nephrotic syndrome are discussed in detail separately.

As with T4, however, the percentage of unbound cortisol is increased, serum free cortisol concentrations are normal, and symptomatic hypocortisolism does not occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>In nephrotic patients, the cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation test may show a suboptimal response due to low cortisol levels associated with urinary loss of CBG. The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cosyntropin-tetracosactide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ACTH stimulation test</a> may normalize in such patients who develop renal failure, which reduces the urinary excretion of CBG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endocrine-dysfunction-in-the-nephrotic-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17701632\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have nephrotic syndrome but a relatively normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may have low total T4, T3, and reverse T3 (rT3) but normal serum free T4 and T3 concentrations, <span class=\"nowrap\">T3/T4</span> ratio, and thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations. Such patients are usually clinically euthyroid, and thyroid hormone replacement is generally not required. Thyroid function test abnormalities may be more severe when GFR is reduced. If hypothyroidism is suspected clinically in such a patient, serum TSH should be measured. In addition, it is reasonable to perform testing at the time nephrotic syndrome is diagnosed and then at least annually in patients who remain nephrotic.
