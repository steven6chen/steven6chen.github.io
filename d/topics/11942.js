In addition, the selective COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs) introduced a novel strategy for the reduction of NSAID-related gastroduodenal toxicity. However, the advantage of these coxibs over nonselective NSAIDs is still debatable and concerns about cardiovascular toxicity has limited the use of coxibs.

Emphasis will be placed upon studies that used clinically relevant end points (symptomatic ulcers and complicated ulcers, including bleeding, perforating, and obstructing ulcers). Studies using endoscopic detection of ulcers as the end point will be cited only when data on more meaningful clinical end points are lacking. The pathogenesis, treatment, and secondary prevention of NSAID-induced gastroduodenal injury are discussed separately.

Two related isoforms of COX exist: COX-1 and COX-2.

An NSAID-induced gastrointestinal complication should be suspected if the patient develops unexplained blood loss anemia, iron deficiency, significant dyspepsia, or exhibits overt GI bleeding. The appropriate test to order is upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, unless ulcer perforation is suspected in which case computed tomography scan of the abdomen should be ordered immediately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, multiple studies have evaluated a variety of strategies for preventing ulcers in patients requiring prolonged nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The following represents recommendations based upon the available data and expert consensus.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of gastroduodenal toxicity is related to risk factors described above, the patient's <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> (<em>H. pylori</em>) status, and the specific type and dose of NSAID. Significant gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity generally does not begin for several weeks, although it can appear as early as day 7 with some NSAIDs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a>. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ability to modify the risk depends upon the clinical setting. As noted above, patients with a history of uncomplicated or complicated peptic ulcers (gastric, duodenal) should be tested for <em>H. pylori</em> prior to beginning a NSAID or low dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. If present, <em>H. pylori</em> should be treated with appropriate therapy, even if it is believed that the prior ulcer was due to NSAIDs. (See <a href=\"#H3541993414\" class=\"local\">'Role of helicobacter pylori'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attempts should be made to use the lowest dose and shortest duration of NSAID treatment that is feasible. While it is preferable to use NSAIDs with the lowest potential for GI toxicity, all NSAIDs are associated with an increased risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In asymptomatic patients with no history of ulcer and not currently taking an NSAID, physicians can consider <em>H. pylori</em> testing prior to beginning long-term therapy with a NSAID. It is possible that successfully treating <em>H. pylori</em> infection in such individuals will reduce the risk of NSAID-related ulcer complications, but additional studies of this approach are needed. This &quot;test-and-treat&quot; approach may be more useful in populations with a relatively high prevalence of <em>H. pylori</em> infection. On the other hand, we recommend testing for <em>H. pylori</em> in patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease or complications (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-secondary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Secondary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who have multiple risk factors for NSAID-related gastroduodenal toxicity, options include therapy with a COX-2 selective inhibitor or a nonselective NSAID in combination with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>. High dose H2 receptor antagonists are an alternative to a PPI or misoprostol. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Selective COX-2 inhibitors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H855394638\" class=\"local\">'Proton pump inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend co-administration of a PPI in patients who require an NSAID and are at high or moderate risk for GI toxicity (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.) We prefer PPIs to other preventive approaches because of their convenience and relatively good safety profile.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approved doses of these drugs in patients taking nonselective NSAIDs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> (200 mcg four times daily), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lansoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lansoprazole</a> (15 or 30 mg daily), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esomeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esomeprazole</a> (20 or 40 mg daily). Although not all PPIs have received FDA approval, they probably all have similar effectiveness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a COX-2 inhibitor is used, it is important to realize that any GI protective effect may be eliminated or reduced with the concomitant use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for cardiovascular prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H502553862\" class=\"local\">'Celecoxib versus naproxen plus lansoprazole, together with low dose aspirin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An NSAID-induced gastrointestinal complication should be suspected if the patient develops unexplained blood loss anemia, iron deficiency, severe dyspepsia, or exhibits overt GI bleeding. Patients who develop NSAID-induced non-ulcer dyspepsia may respond to H2 antagonists or PPIs at standard doses, but of these choices only PPIs also reliably reduce the risk of NSAID-induced ulcer or its complications. Development of dyspepsia may signal that an ulcer has developed at which point an upper endoscopy can be considered. Switching to a different NSAID or to a COX-2 inhibitor may eliminate dyspepsia and obviate the need for an H2 antagonist or PPI. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Misoprostol</a> does not reduce, and may even increase, dyspeptic symptoms.
