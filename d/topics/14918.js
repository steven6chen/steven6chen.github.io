Nucleotide sequence studies of HCV demonstrate that the disease following OLT results from the same viral strain present before OLT. Virologic reinfection at the time of transplantation is not surprising since almost all patients are viremic at this time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Reinfection occurs during reperfusion of the allograft in the operating room, and although viral levels decline in the first days after removal of the infected liver, they rebound and reach pretransplant levels within 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Furthermore, peripheral monocytes may also harbor virus and act as a source for reinfection of the donor liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR PROGRESSIVE DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Variables that influence the progression of recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) are incompletely understood, but donor characteristics (donor type, age), viral characteristics (genotype, viral load), the inflammatory grade of the explanted liver, and the patient's immune status and immunosuppressive regimen may be important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/7-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Donor characteristics</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Age</strong> &ndash; The donor characteristic that most strongly predicts outcome is age.

A meta-analysis of 14 studies with 2024 patients with HCV who received a transplantation from a living donor found comparable patient survival rates at years 1 through 5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Graft survival rates at years 1 and 3 were lower among those who received a graft from a living donor but were similar at years 2, 4, and 5.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transplant center expertise</strong> &ndash; A multicenter living donor liver transplantation cohort revealed that the experience of the transplantation center may be the driving factor in predicting patient outcomes in living donor recipients with HCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Patient and graft survival were similar among recipients of living or deceased organs when performed in centers that had performed at least 20 living donor transplants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HLA match</strong> &ndash; The influence of having a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatched donor on the severity of disease recurrence following OLT remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/9,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,16</a>]. No consistent site of mismatch associated with disease recurrence has been identified.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Genotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The influence of HCV genotype (particularly genotype 1b) on the severity of disease recurrence following OLT is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/9,10,13-17,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,13-17,37</a>]. The range of findings that have been reported can be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 652 patients from 15 European centers, genotype 1b was an independent risk factor for recurrent hepatitis but not for patient or graft survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective series with 745 liver transplantation recipients with a median follow-up of 3.1 years, patients with genotype 1 were more likely than patients with genotype 2, 3, or 4 to develop advanced fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

However, the relationships between pretransplant viral load, and viral load after transplantation on graft and patient survival are not well understood. Studies examining the effect of pretransplant HCV viral load on the likelihood of HCV recurrence have produced discordant results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/10,14,15,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,15,38</a>]. Several reports found that pretransplant viral load did not correlate with either the likelihood or timing of HCV recurrence following OLT and did not predict the severity of liver disease when it occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/10,14,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,38</a>]. By contrast, in one series of 166 HCV-infected liver transplantation recipients, those with HCV RNA titers greater than 1 million viral <span class=\"nowrap\">equivalents/mL</span> had a significantly lower cumulative five-year survival compared with patients with lower pretransplant titers (57 versus 84 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. High titers of HCV RNA in the explanted liver may also be a risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>The influence of viral load following OLT is also uncertain. Some studies have suggested that viral levels in patients after transplantation do not correlate well with the severity of histologic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>], which is similar to the lack of correlation observed outside the transplantation setting. By contrast, other studies have found that an increase in viral titers was associated with worse histologic activity, increased risk of fibrosis, and decreased survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/18,19,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H234608081\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammatory grade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree of inflammation present in the patient's explanted liver at the time of transplantation appears to predict fibrosis progression in recurrent HCV. This was examined in a retrospective study of 134 patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Patients were divided into two groups based upon the degree of fibrosis in the explanted liver (group 1 = Ishak grade &le;4; group 2 = Ishak grade &gt;4). Five-year advanced fibrosis-free survival was significantly higher among patients in group 1 compared with group 2 (63 versus 28 percent). In addition, rates of graft loss at one and five years were significantly lower in patients in group 1 (3 versus 6 percent and 14 versus 36 percent, respectively). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histologic-scoring-systems-for-chronic-liver-disease#H23839896\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Histologic scoring systems for chronic liver disease&quot;, section on 'Knodell score/histology activity index'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunosuppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The level and type of immunosuppression following transplantation likely influence the severity of disease recurrence. The impact of immunosuppression is most pronounced when high-intensity regimens are used to treat acute rejection, particularly with high-dose bolus steroids and anti-lymphocyte antibody preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/15,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,45,46</a>]. There are no convincing data to support the use of any specific induction or maintenance regimen, and it is likely that choice of initial calcineurin inhibitor (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>) does not significantly impact outcomes in HCV-positive liver transplant recipients overall. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-in-adults-overview-of-immunosuppression#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation in adults: Overview of immunosuppression&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoids and HCV'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-in-adults-overview-of-immunosuppression#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation in adults: Overview of immunosuppression&quot;, section on 'Calcineurin inhibitors and HCV'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">CD4 cell response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The specific CD4 cell response to HCV appears to be an important determinant of the severity of histologic recurrence following liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. This was illustrated in a series that included 43 patients transplanted for HCV in whom histologic recurrence of HCV was categorized as mild or absent (80 percent) or severe (20 percent). Patients with severe recurrence were far less likely to have a CD4 T-cell response to HCV antigens (0 versus 40 percent with a response to at least one HCV antigen).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As in the pretransplantation setting, the clinical course of HCV infection following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is variable. Five-year survival after transplantation is approximately 60 to 80 percent in most series, which is comparable to transplants performed for alcoholic liver disease, and better than historic rates for hepatitis B, hemochromatosis, or cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/9,15,17,49-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15,17,49-52</a>]. However, examination of the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients in the United States has shown that over the last two decades, there has been a significant improvement in post-transplant survival in HCV-negative liver transplant recipients that was not seen in HCV-positive individuals, and that overall survival is lower in HCV-positive individuals compared with HCV-negative patients as a whole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Recurrent HCV-related graft failure remains the leading cause of death in these patients, though hepatocellular carcinoma is also an important predictor of five-year patient or graft survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The course of HCV infection after OLT is accelerated compared with the pretransplant setting, with 10 to 20 percent of patients developing cirrhosis only five years post-transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The favorable estimates of outcomes described above may reflect publication bias, since centers with worse outcomes may be less likely to report their findings. Survival statistics from the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) may provide a more comprehensive profile of transplantation outcomes.</p><p>One such analysis of transplants conducted between 1992 and 1998 suggested that HCV-positive recipients had an increased rate of death (hazard ratio [HR] 1.23; 95% CI 1.12-1.35) and allograft failure (HR 1.30; 95% CI 1.21-1.39) compared with transplantation of HCV negative recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. One-, three-, and five-year patient survival rates were 86, 78, and 70 percent, respectively (compared with 88, 82, and 77 percent, respectively, for patients without HCV). The reduction in survival persisted even after adjusting for potential confounders. The effect on survival appeared to be most pronounced in HCV-infected women. These trends persisted at least through 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>A second study also found that women are at increased risk for advanced recurrent HCV and graft loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In that study, 1264 patients who underwent liver transplantation for HCV between 2002 and 2007 were followed for a median of three years. Female sex was an independent predictor of advanced recurrent disease (HR 1.3), graft loss (HR 1.3), and death (HR 1.3). The unadjusted three-year cumulated patient and graft survival rates were 75 and 74 percent, respectively, for women, and 80 and 78 percent, respectively, for men.</p><p>Outcomes may also be influenced by the patient's race. An analysis of transplants performed in the United States between 1988 and 1996 suggested that overall survival may be slightly lower among African-Americans compared with white Americans and Hispanics (two-year survival 72 versus 80 and 77 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Thus, it is likely that short-term outcomes for HCV-infected patients are similar but diverge progressively over time due to the impact of recurrent HCV and graft cirrhosis.</p><p>Coinfection with HIV is another factor that influences outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. It has been estimated that compared with patients who are infected with HCV alone, those with HCV and HIV have a survival rate that is approximately 10 percent lower, with three-year survival rates of 60 to 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Patterns of disease recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although HCV RNA is universally detectable following transplantation, the clinical course of HCV recurrence is variable.

The development of cholestatic hepatitis may be more common in patients with higher HCV viral load, in patients who receive higher levels of immunosuppressive medications or had treated acute cellular rejection, and possibly in patients with an IL28B genotype other than CC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/42,60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,60,61</a>].

Early markers of likely progression to severe recurrence may include early hepatic stellate cell activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>] and a hepatic venous pressure gradient of 6 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Transplantation of HCV-infected grafts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the shortage of organs, transplantation of livers from HCV-infected donors to HCV-infected recipients has been attempted. A study evaluating the outcome of 23 such patients found that five-year survival was similar to a control group of HCV-infected recipients who had received grafts from HCV-negative donors (89 versus 88 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Furthermore, an interesting observation was that patients in whom the donor strain became predominant after transplantation had significantly longer disease-free survival compared with patients who retained their original HCV strain (90 versus 15 percent).

Serum alanine aminotransferase levels are often normal or minimally elevated with HCV infection. In addition, ELISA-based HCV assays are insensitive in immunosuppressed patients and may revert from positive to negative after OLT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and evaluation of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are two steps involved in establishing the diagnosis of new or recurrent HCV infection following OLT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of polymerase chain reaction or transcription mediated amplification to directly detect HCV ribonucleic acid. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, stage the disease, and plan for treatment.</p><p/><p>Biopsy findings are typically mild and nonspecific, particularly with early recurrence. They include periportal inflammation, lobular ballooning of hepatocytes, acidophilic bodies, or lobular apoptosis. Some of these features are also seen in acute cellular rejection. Features that are supportive of recurrent HCV are lobular activity, interface hepatitis, piecemeal necrosis, and lymphocyte predominance or lymphoid follicles. Features more suggestive of rejection include a mixed cellular infiltrate (eosinophils, polymorphonuclear cells, and lymphocytes) confined to the portal triad, bile duct damage, and endotheliitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71743\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71743 \">table 1</a>). However, differentiating rejection with HCV from HCV infection alone can be difficult on pathologic grounds and is often a clinical diagnosis based on timing post-transplantation and clinical features (eg, the degree of baseline immunosuppression, prior rejection treatment) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71743\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71743 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Studies have also looked for noninvasive markers of HCV-related recurrent fibrosis, including serologic panels as well as imaging assessments including ultrasound elastography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. As an example, one study with 133 patients looked at an algorithm that included three serum fibrosis markers (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a>, amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen, and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase type-1 concentration) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. The area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve for the algorithm predicting fibrosis of stage 2 or greater (using the Scheurer classification) at one year post-transplantation was 0.78.

Despite this progress in noninvasive tools, liver biopsy remains the gold standard for monitoring of fibrosis progression given the limitations of the available noninvasive markers, and the lack of serologic testing that can differentiate HCV from other pathology such as rejection.

Traditionally, due to limitations in our treatment armamentarium, most patients have been treated once they have significant histologic recurrence. However, with the implementation of safer, more effective direct-acting antiviral regimens, pretransplant and preemptive treatment strategies are likely to be of increasing importance. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56439399\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment prior to transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eradication of HCV infection prior to transplantation would be the ideal approach, as patients who undergo transplantation in the absence of viremia are much less likely to have recurrent infection. With the availability of direct-acting antiviral agents and the improved safety profile with these regimens, interferon-free treatment is the preferred approach for treatment of patients with cirrhosis when available. Treatment with interferon-based therapy in this setting had been associated with exacerbations of encephalopathy, infections, and other serious adverse events and results in low rates of viral clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recurrence-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection-following-liver-transplantation/abstract/76-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-78</a>]. </p><p>Even in the setting of interferon-free regimens, treatment of patients with decompensated cirrhosis warrants careful regimen selection and close monitoring.

Recurrent HCV infection following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the post-transplantation setting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical course following OLT for HCV infection is variable. As a general rule, the course of HCV infection appears to be accelerated compared with the pretransplant setting. Several patterns of recurrence have been described. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many predictors of outcome following transplantation have been described, but their accuracy in predicting the course in individual patients or to guide interventions is uncertain. The use of older donors is likely associated with adverse outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors for progressive disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of recurrent HCV infection is based upon the detection of HCV ribonucleic acid, and compatible histologic characteristics. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No effective measure to prevent recurrence has been established, though treatment with interferon-free regimens on the transplant waitlist may soon become standard. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Available treatment regimens are highly effective and well tolerated in both the pre- and post-transplant settings. Although all patients who do not achieve a sustained virologic response pre-transplant should be treated post-transplant, the optimal timing is uncertain, and the decision of when to treat must be made on an individual basis. Our approach is to treat patients between three and six months post-transplant as recurrent HCV should still be mild, any complications have been addressed, and immunosuppression levels are low. However, earlier therapy may be needed in patients with significant early histologic recurrence. Therapy should only be attempted at centers with considerable experience in managing post-transplantation patients.
