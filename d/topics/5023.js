The most extensive data come from a cohort study that analyzed the frequency of malignancy in over 175,000 solid organ transplant recipients during the period 1987 to 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The most common organs transplanted included kidney, liver, heart, and lung (in 58, 22, 10, and 4 percent of cases, respectively).</p><p>Overall, malignancy was identified in over 10,656 cases, which correlated with a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 2.10 (95% CI 2.06-2.14) compared with the general population and an excess absolute risk (EAR) of 719 cases per 100,000 person-years.</p><p>A significantly increased risk of malignancy was associated with more than 30 different primary sites.

As an example, the frequency of non-Hodgkin lymphoma was approximately twofold greater in recipients of lung transplants compared with those who received a kidney, liver, or heart transplant. Conversely, there was an approximately threefold increase in lung cancer among lung transplant recipients, and the frequency of liver and kidney cancer was increased in liver and kidney transplant recipients, respectively.</p><p>Similar patterns of increased incidence were observed in a review of the literature that included studies from five tumor registries in Europe, Canada, and Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When all cancers are considered, the average age at diagnosis is approximately 40 years, and the average latency is approximately three to five years after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].

The latency is even longer among patients who received allografts as children, in whom the lesions often develop during adulthood (mean interval after transplantation was 142 months for carcinomas of the vulva and perineum in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin cancers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin cancers, especially squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas, but also melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), and KS, are more common than in the nontransplant population.

Similarly, the incidence of this malignancy was reported to be approximately 20-fold higher in a study of renal transplant recipients from Australia compared with the nonimmunosuppressed population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Lesions tend to be multiple <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extensive, particularly in women, one-third of whom have concurrent cervical cancer. Clinically, these lesions often appear as pigmented papular lesions, but they may resemble genital warts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of lung cancer has been noted to be particularly increased in recipients of heart and lung transplants, and this may be related to the high incidence of cigarette smoking leading to heart and lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. However, the incidence also appears to be increased following kidney and liver transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Lung transplants are frequently carried out in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease secondary to smoking. In this setting, the incidence of lung cancer is markedly increased and frequently arises in the residual native lung in recipients of a single-lung transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As an example, in a series of 520 lung transplants conducted at a single institution over a 17-year period, 12 patients developed lung cancer, 11 of which occurred in the residual native lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The increased incidence of lung cancer compared with the general population is similar to that seen in patients infected with HIV and thus may be a reflection of the role of chronic, prolonged immunosuppression.

This is a function of the geographic distribution of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8, also known as KS-associated herpesvirus [KSHV]) (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below). There is a male predilection (male to female ratio 3.3:1), and the average age at diagnosis is 43 years, younger than for patients with classic KS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>The clinical presentation is similar to that of classic KS, manifested as angiomatous lesions predominantly affecting the legs and causing lymphedema. Although the incidence varies by population, approximately 90 percent of patients have cutaneous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mucosal lesions, while 10 percent have disease that is limited to the viscera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. For unclear reasons, visceral involvement is less common in patients with kidney as compared with liver or heart allografts (25 to 30 versus 50 percent). At least partly because of this, patients who develop KS after a liver or heart transplant have shorter survival than those who have undergone renal transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphoproliferative disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of malignant lymphoproliferative disorders occurring following solid organ transplantation are of B-cell origin, most commonly non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Since urine cytology is unreliable for nonfunctioning native kidneys, surveillance ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT) scanning has been suggested for routine monitoring. Based upon an assumed growth rate of less than 1 cm per year and the observation that tumors less than 3 cm in size are usually limited to the kidney, it has been recommended that ultrasonography examinations be performed every three years to detect early-stage RCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Others have suggested yearly imaging screening examinations.</p><p>There is also some evidence that RCC is more common among kidney transplant recipients than previously appreciated, particularly in those with acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD). For some clinicians, this suggests that an even more intensive screening may be warranted in some patients. As an example, in a prospective study, ultrasound screening of the native kidneys was performed in 561 patients, of whom 129 had ACKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Newly diagnosed RCC was found in eight patients (1.5 percent), seven having ACKD.

Thus, the prevalence of renal cancer was 4.8 percent in the whole group and 19.4 percent among those with ACKD.</p><p>Based upon these findings, the authors recommend the following screening approach, which varies with the presence of ACKD and radiologic characteristics of cysts in the native kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">85,86</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Independent of ACKD, all transplant patients should, at minimum, undergo ultrasonography of the native kidneys once a year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ACKD plus Bosniak category I or II cysts should undergo renal ultrasonography twice a year and CT scan for progressive lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ACKD plus Bosniak category IIF cysts should undergo renal ultrasonography four times per year and yearly CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

This is more frequent screening than is generally recommended for the general population since immunosuppression can reactivate viral infection such as human papillomavirus (HPV).

In particular, excess immunosuppression, especially with calcineurin inhibitors, or repeated exposure to agents that selectively target T lymphocytes such as OKT3 should be avoided. Careful screening of the patient and donor prior to transplantation to help detect an underlying pre-existing malignancy should also be performed.

Such measures may result in tumor regression in some cases of lymphoma; some skin cancers; Kaposi sarcoma (KS), in which reducing the calcineurin inhibitor exposure may be particularly important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/10,92-94\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,92-94</a>]; and donor-derived malignancies.

This is because rejection is less likely to occur with double therapy with a calcineurin inhibitor and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> than the combination of an antimetabolite with prednisone. However, some clinicians would substitute <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> for the calcineurin inhibitor and antimetabolite.</p><p>An exception to this is in very well matched human leukocyte antigen (HLA) transplant recipients, such as 0-HLA or 0-B, 0-DR mismatched recipients, in which case the risk of rejection is low with the combination of an antimetabolite and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>.

Among patients listed in the Cincinnati registry, for example, reduction in immunosuppressive therapy was associated with the disappearance of KS in 17 and 16 percent of patients with mucocutaneous disease and visceral involvement, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/25,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,93</a>]. In addition, the substitution of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> in a total of 17 renal transplant recipients has been associated with complete regression of KS, as previously mentioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/48,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,55</a>]. Given these results, we recommend converting to sirolimus from a calcineurin inhibitor in this setting if there are no contraindications for this strategy. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Sirolimus'</a> above.)</p><p>Additional treatment options, which may be required for cases that do not regress spontaneously, are similar to those considered for patients without immunosuppression.

Not surprisingly, the course of these malignancies appears to be more aggressive in transplant recipients, and the outcome is importantly determined by the stage at which the tumor is discovered. Carcinoma in situ can be cured surgically, as can many patients with early invasive disease (6 of 11 in one study, with three others dying of intercurrent disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].
