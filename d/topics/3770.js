The plasma cells proliferate in the bone marrow and often results in extensive skeletal destruction with osteolytic lesions, osteopenia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pathologic fractures. The diagnosis of MM is often suspected because of one (or more) of the following clinical presentations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone pain with lytic lesions discovered on routine skeletal films or other imaging modalities</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increased total serum protein concentration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of a monoclonal protein in the urine or serum</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic signs or symptoms suggestive of malignancy, such as unexplained anemia</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypercalcemia, which is either symptomatic or discovered incidentally</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute renal failure with a bland urinalysis or rarely the nephrotic syndrome due to concurrent immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis</p><p/><p>It is important to distinguish MM both from other causes of the clinical presentations above and from other plasma cell dyscrasias for the purposes of prognosis and treatment. It is also important to evaluate patients suspected of having MM in a timely fashion since a major delay in diagnosis has been associated with a negative impact on the disease course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations, pathologic features, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of MM are discussed here. The pathogenesis and treatment of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-of-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology of multiple myeloma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MM accounts for approximately 1 to 2 percent of all cancers and slightly more than 17 percent of hematologic malignancies in the United States (US) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The annual incidence in the US is approximately 4 to 5 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A similar incidence has been reported in the South Thames area of the United Kingdom and in Europe in general [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Worldwide, there are approximately 154,000 cases and 101,000 deaths per year attributed to MM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>The incidence appears to be stable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. While some reports have suggested an increase in incidence over time, this more likely reflects the enhanced availability and use of medical facilities, especially by older persons. Our database from Olmsted County, Minnesota, has documented a stable incidence from the 1940s to the early 21<sup>st</sup> century [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>MM occurs in all races and all geographic locations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The incidence varies by ethnicity; the incidence in African Americans and Blacks from Africa is two to three times that in Whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In contrast, the risk is lower in Asians from Japan and in Mexicans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. MM is also slightly more frequent in men than in women (approximately 1.4:1). The risk of developing MM increases with body mass index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p>MM is a disease of older adults. The median age at diagnosis is 66 years; only 10 and 2 percent of patients are younger than 50 and 40 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/9,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15</a>].</p><p>A small but unknown fraction of cases are familial. The risk of developing MM is approximately 3.7-fold higher for persons with a first-degree relative with MM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. MM has been reported in clusters of two or more first-degree relatives, identical twins, and in four members spanning three generations in one family, with an incidence of approximately three familial cases per 1000 patients with myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/16-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-31</a>]. In one report of 15 families with MM clustering, 10 occurred in siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The same IgG kappa monoclonal pattern was present in all cases in seven families. In addition, a genome-wide association study that genotyped 1675 patients with MM and compared them with 5903 control subjects suggested that persons with a common variation at the 3p22.1 or 7p15.3 genetic loci are at a higher risk of developing MM (odds ratios of 1.32 and 1.38, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. While intriguing, such cases would be expected to account for less than 5 percent of familial risk. The low hazard ratios indicate that these markers do not have any direct clinical implications, and reflect the complexity of the disease and the etiologic mechanism involved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H839433530\"><span class=\"h2\">Spectrum of disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with MM present with signs or symptoms related to the infiltration of plasma cells into the bone or other organs or to kidney damage from excess light chains. As an example, a retrospective analysis of 1027 sequential patients diagnosed with MM at a single institution found the following symptoms and signs at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anemia &ndash; 73 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone pain &ndash; 58 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated creatinine &ndash; 48 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Fatigue/generalized</span> weakness &ndash; 32 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypercalcemia &ndash; 28 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss &ndash; 24 percent, one-half of whom had lost &ge;9 kg</p><p/><p>Symptoms and signs present in 5 percent or less included: paresthesias (5 percent), hepatomegaly (4 percent), splenomegaly (1 percent), lymphadenopathy (1 percent), and fever (0.7 percent). Pleural effusion and diffuse pulmonary involvement due to plasma cell infiltration are rare and usually occur in advanced disease. As the use of &quot;routine&quot; blood work has become more common, patients are being diagnosed earlier in the disease course.</p><p>Extramedullary plasmacytomas (EP) are seen in approximately 7 percent of patients with MM at the time of diagnosis, and is best diagnosed by <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scan; the presence of EP at diagnosis is associated with inferior survival.

Anemia commonly results in complaints of fatigue and pallor seen on physical examination.</p><p>Macrocytosis (mean corpuscular volume &gt;100 fL) was present in 9 percent of 1027 patients studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this study, 53 patients (11 percent) with a MCV &gt;100 fL had a vitamin B12 level &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/L</span>. This finding is similar to a prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency of 14 percent seen in a separate study of 664 consecutive patients with plasma cell dyscrasias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

The pain is usually induced by movement and does not occur at night except with change of position. The patient's height may be reduced by several inches because of vertebral collapse.

Two major causes of renal insufficiency in patients with MM are light chain cast nephropathy (also called myeloma kidney) and hypercalcemia. Patients who do not secrete light chains are not at risk for myeloma kidney. In the absence of other causes of renal failure, a presumptive diagnosis of light-chain cast nephropathy can be made in the setting of high involved free light chain levels (typically &gt;1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span>. In contrast, renal biopsy should be performed to document typical histologic changes in patients with suspected cast nephropathy, especially if the serum-involved FLC level is &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

The ionized calcium should be measured if the patient has a high serum calcium level but no symptoms of hypercalcemia. Elevation of the serum calcium may be due to binding of the monoclonal protein with calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

An exception to this general rule occurs in the infrequent subset of patients with POEMS syndrome (osteosclerotic myeloma) in which neuropathy occurs in nearly 100 percent of patients. The pathogenesis of the neuropathy is uncertain but a paraneoplastic mechanism may be important; this issue is discussed separately.

It is usually associated with high-risk cytogenetics; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels may be elevated. Survival appears to have improved slightly since the incorporation of immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors into first-line therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Rare cases of encephalopathy due to hyperviscosity or high blood levels of ammonia, in the absence of liver involvement, have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-49</a>].

In a series of 1596 patients with primary amyloidosis seen at the Mayo Clinic between 1960 and 1994, only six (0.4 percent) showed delayed progression (at 10 to 81 months) to overt MM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. This usually occurs in patients without cardiac or hepatic amyloid who live long enough to develop MM. On the other hand, the development of dipstick-positive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema or heart failure in a patient with known MM suggests superimposed amyloidosis or light chain deposition disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">POEMS syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>POEMS syndrome (osteosclerotic myeloma: <strong>P</strong>olyneuropathy, <strong>O</strong>rganomegaly, <strong>E</strong>ndocrinopathy, <strong>M</strong>onoclonal protein, <strong>S</strong>kin changes) is a monoclonal plasma cell disorder accompanied by symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs of peripheral neuropathy, osteosclerotic lesions, Castleman's disease, organomegaly, endocrinopathy (excluding diabetes mellitus or hypothyroidism), edema, typical skin changes, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> papilledema. These patients typically have elevated serum VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poems-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;POEMS syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Polyneuropathy is uncommon in classical MM and, when present, is usually due to the presence of amyloidosis. The presence of anemia, hypercalcemia, renal failure, pathologic fractures, and a high percent of plasma cells in the bone marrow all serve to distinguish classical MM from POEMS syndrome.</p><p>In rare instances, MM may be associated with the presence of diffuse and not focal osteosclerotic bone lesions. Such patients have the typical clinical and laboratory features of MM and do not have the other characteristics of POEMS syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h2\">Metastatic carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of lytic bone lesions in a patient with a monoclonal gammopathy suggests the possibility of MM. However, metastatic carcinoma (eg, kidney, breast, non-small cell lung cancer) can produce lytic lesions, and a subset of patients presenting in this way will have metastatic cancer with an associated, unrelated monoclonal gammopathy (eg, MGUS). Persons presenting with lytic bone lesions, constitutional symptoms, a small M component, and fewer than 10 percent clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow are more likely to have metastatic carcinoma with an unrelated MGUS rather than MM. This can be confirmed with a biopsy of the bone lesion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-adult-patients-with-bone-metastasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of adult patients with bone metastasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Similarly, for patients with lytic lesions in whom no M-protein is found in the serum or urine, metastatic carcinoma should be excluded before the diagnosis of nonsecretory myeloma is seriously considered, by performing a biopsy of one of the lytic lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54124\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54124 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MM is a heterogeneous disease with some patients progressing rapidly despite treatment and others not requiring therapy for a number of years. Distinction between these two groups is important so that treatment can be initiated in appropriate patients and postponed in those who do not need it. The prognosis of MM is presented separately.

Most patients with MM present with signs or symptoms related to the infiltration of plasma cells into the bone or other organs or to kidney damage from excess light chains. Common presentations include anemia, bone pain, elevated creatinine or serum protein, fatigue, and hypercalcemia. Less common, but emergent presentations include spinal cord compression and severe hypercalcemia. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with suspected myeloma or related disorders, appropriate initial screening tests include a serum protein electrophoresis along with immunofixation, and a serum free light chain assay. A 24-hour urine collection for electrophoresis and immunofixation must be done if a diagnosis of MM is made. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of MM includes a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging, a complete blood count with differential and a chemistry screen. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of MM requires &ge;10 percent clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow <strong>or</strong> biopsy-proven bony or soft tissue plasmacytoma <strong>plus</strong> one of the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57627\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57627 \">table 2</a>) (see <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Presence of related organ or tissue impairment that can be attributed to the plasma cell proliferative disorder (eg, increased calcium, renal insufficiency, anemia, lytic bone lesions)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Presence of a biomarker associated with near inevitable progression to end-organ damage (ie, &ge;60 percent clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow; <span class=\"nowrap\">involved/uninvolved</span> free light chain [FLC] ratio of 100 or more [the involved FLC level must also be at least 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> or more]; or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] with more than one focal lesion).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infiltration with malignant plasma cells may be focal, requiring <span class=\"nowrap\">aspiration/biopsy</span> at multiple sites.
