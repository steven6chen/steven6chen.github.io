The anterior scalp, mid scalp, temporal scalp, and vertex of the scalp are the typical sites of involvement. Hair loss occurs over the course of years. </p><p>Although androgenetic alopecia is a benign and asymptomatic disorder, cosmetic concerns lead some patients to seek treatment. The primary pharmacologic therapies for men with androgenetic alopecia are topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minoxidil</a> and oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a>. Hair restoration surgery can also result in cosmetic improvement.</p><p>The treatment of androgenetic alopecia in men will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of male androgenetic alopecia are reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Androgenetic alopecia in men: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">FIRST-LINE THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minoxidil</a> and oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a> are the therapeutic agents that have been most extensively studied for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia in men. Both drugs have demonstrated efficacy and high tolerability in placebo-controlled randomized trials, supporting their status as first-line agents. The response to treatment with finasteride or minoxidil varies. While some men achieve cosmetically significant regrowth, others benefit most from the slowing of additional hair loss. Continuation of these drugs is required to maintain the results of therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Finasteride</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Finasteride</a> is an oral inhibitor of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) production that is efficacious for male androgenetic alopecia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533493\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanism of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Finasteride</a> competitively inhibits the 5-alpha-reductase type 2 enzyme, and thereby inhibits conversion of testosterone to DHT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. At a dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> finasteride lowers serum and scalp DHT levels by more than 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The drug has no affinity for the androgen receptor and does not interfere with testosterone action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H21714534\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Androgenetic alopecia in men: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A meta-analysis of placebo-controlled randomized trials identified moderate quality evidence in support of the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a> for treatment of androgenetic alopecia in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. After 6 or 12 months of treatment, the mean percentage change in hair count was 9 percent higher among patients treated with finasteride compared with patients who were given placebo (95% CI 8-11 percent). This difference increased over time. After 48 months of therapy, the mean percentage change in hair count was 24 percent (95% CI 18-31 percent) higher in patients treated with finasteride. </p><p>The proportion of men who achieve clinically significant responses to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a> was assessed in two one-year randomized trials that were included in the meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A total of 1553 men aged 18 to 41 years with predominantly vertex hair loss were randomly assigned to oral finasteride (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or placebo for one year, with blinded extension studies for a second year in 1215 of the men. Finasteride treatment resulted in clinically significant increases in hair count, while treatment with placebo was associated with progressive hair loss. After two years, scalp coverage as assessed by the study investigators was improved in approximately two-thirds of men taking finasteride, versus only 7 percent of men who received placebo. One-third of the men treated with finasteride had the same amount of hair as they did at the start of the study, and only about 1 percent of patients on finasteride lost hair (versus one-third of patients who received placebo). In addition, more men in the finasteride group reported increased satisfaction with their hair after treatment (51 versus 25 percent).</p><p>Although most published studies documenting the efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a> have focused on the vertex of the scalp, the efficacy of finasteride is not limited to this area. A randomized trial of 326 men found that the drug was efficacious for frontal scalp hair thinning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, a subsequent randomized trial found statistically significant hair growth in the vertex, <span class=\"nowrap\">anterior/mid,</span> frontal, and temporal scalp, with the best results observed in the vertex and <span class=\"nowrap\">anterior/mid</span> scalp. Age appeared to be relevant in the response to treatment; treatment was more effective in younger men (ages 18 to 41) than older men (ages 41 to 60). </p><p>In addition to improved hair counts, other factors, such as increases in hair thickness, pigmentation, and length may contribute to the perception of improved scalp coverage during therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This concept is supported by a randomized trial that followed men treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a> for up to 192 weeks and found that net improvements in hair weight were greater than improvements in hair count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H335149\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the treatment of male androgenetic alopecia, the recommended dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a> is 1 mg per day. The medication may be taken with or without food. </p><p>Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a> should continue for at least 12 months to assess the drug's full effects, and the drug must be continued to maintain efficacy.

These include erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and ejaculatory dysfunction. A systematic review of nine trials with a total of 3570 patients found an overall absolute increase in sexual dysfunction of 1.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The risk for sexual side effects increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Sexual side effects related to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a> usually resolve after discontinuation of the medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, persistent sexual dysfunction after the discontinuation of finasteride was reported in a survey-based study of 71 men who associated their symptoms of sexual dysfunction with the use of finasteride for hair loss. The mean age of the study participants was 26 years and the mean duration of finasteride use was 28 months. Twenty percent of these men reported continued symptoms for greater than six years after cessation of the medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Moreover, a follow-up study of 54 of the interviewed men found that 9 to 16 months after the initial survey, 96 percent continued to report sexual side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Additional studies are needed to validate these findings and evaluate the frequency with which persistent sexual dysfunction might occur. </p><p>Reductions in sperm count also may occur during treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. This effect reverses after drug discontinuation. </p><p>Other rare side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a> include gynecomastia, testicular pain, and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Side effects are more likely to occur with the typical 5 mg dose used to treat benign prostatic hypertrophy. Although finasteride is teratogenic, the finasteride concentration in semen does not pose a risk to women trying to conceive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23687608\"><span class=\"h3\">Precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Finasteride</a> may impact measurement of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA).

Due to evidence in support of greater efficacy of minoxidil 5% solution compared with minoxidil 2% solution in men, use of the 5% concentration is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>The subsequent development of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minoxidil</a> 5% foam offered an alternative vehicle for drug delivery that is preferred by some patients. In addition, unlike minoxidil solution, the foam formulation is free of propylene glycol, a feature that correlates with a lower risk for skin irritation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H956509\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanism of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Minoxidil</a> promotes hair growth by increasing the duration of anagen, shortening telogen, and enlarging miniaturized follicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The pathophysiologic mechanism through which minoxidil influences follicular structure and follicular cycling is unclear, and the interpretation of the available literature is complicated by studies with conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/2,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19</a>]. Minoxidil is a vasodilator, and the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may be a mechanism by which minoxidil helps to maintain the vascularity and size of dermal papillae (collections of mesenchymal tissue beneath follicles that contribute to follicular development) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Since the volume of a dermal papilla correlates with the size of the emerging hair follicle, minoxidil-induced support of the dermal papilla may be relevant. In addition, minoxidil is a regulator of potassium ion channels. This function may also contribute to the drug's beneficial effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H956516\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both 2% and 5% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minoxidil</a> solution are more efficacious than placebo in male androgenetic alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/17,18,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,23</a>].

After 48 weeks of therapy, 5% minoxidil was significantly better than the 2% solution or placebo in terms of change from baseline in nonvellus hair count (increase in count of 18.6, 12.7, and 3.9 per cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively), patient ratings of scalp coverage and treatment benefit, and investigator rating of scalp coverage. Treatment with 5% minoxidil was also associated with an earlier therapeutic response and an improvement in the patients' psychological perceptions of hair loss.

Hair transplantation using follicular units has become the mainstay of surgical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. More invasive and complex procedures that aim to reorient large areas of hair-bearing skin, such as scalp reduction and flaps, are now less commonly performed. The ideal candidates for hair transplantation are patients with stable or medically controlled androgenetic alopecia who desire permanent improvements in hair loss and have an adequate reservoir of hair for transplantation. </p><p>The basic principle governing hair transplantation is that of &quot;donor dominance.&quot; Hair follicles removed from non-balding occipital scalp and transplanted into areas affected by androgenetic alopecia will maintain the characteristics of the occipital scalp donor site. Because occipital hair is relatively resistant to androgenetic alopecia, transplanted hairs will remain large caliber hairs. &#160;</p><p>Modern hair transplant techniques rely on the use of &quot;follicular units,&quot; which are the natural groupings of one to four hair follicles that occur in the scalp. There are two fundamental ways that a hair transplant can be performed using follicular units: <strong>follicular unit transplantation</strong> (FUT) and <strong>follicular unit extraction </strong>(FUE). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Follicular unit transplantation </strong>&ndash; With FUT, a strip of tissue 8 to 15 mm wide and 20 to 30 cm long is surgically excised from the occipital scalp under local anesthesia. Follicular units are carefully dissected from the tissue strip with the aid of microscopes and then transplanted into areas of androgenetic alopecia. The procedure leaves a thin linear scar in the occipital scalp. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Follicular unit extraction </strong>&ndash; FUE involves the removal of individual follicular units, one by one, from a wide area of the occipital scalp. Although not truly a &quot;scarless&quot; technique, FUE does not leave a linear scar and has advantages for men who want to wear their hair very short. </p><p/><p>It takes five to eight hours to perform a standard hair transplant session, with FUE taking longer to perform than FUT. A small hair transplant session may involve the transplantation of 800 to 1000 follicular units. A large session (megasession) would involve 3000 to 6000 grafts of follicular units.</p><p>Patients can continue to lose nontransplanted hairs within susceptible areas following hair transplantation, resulting in diminishing satisfaction with the results. The continuation of medical treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minoxidil</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a> following a hair transplant procedure may help to limit further loss of preexisting scalp hair. In a randomized trial of 79 men who underwent hair transplantation for androgenetic alopecia, those treated with finasteride 1 mg for four weeks prior to the transplant and for 48 weeks after the transplant achieved better results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-androgenetic-alopecia-in-men/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23687420\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple other therapies have been utilized for androgenetic alopecia.
