The average age of ovarian cancer diagnosis varies with type of mutation.

The risk is higher (20 percent) in older women (rrBSO at age 45 years or older). Thus, prior to rrBSO, women should undergo evaluation for the presence of an ovarian malignancy with pelvic sonography and serum cancer antigen (CA) 125; the only exception to this is if a plan is made to perform complete surgical staging if ovarian, fallopian tubal, or peritoneal cancer is found a time of planned rrBSO.

The strategies proposed include bilateral salpingectomy alone or salpingectomy followed by delayed oophorectomy, thereby avoiding premature menopause and preserving oocytes for assisted reproduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-reducing-bilateral-salpingo-oophorectomy-in-women-at-high-risk-of-epithelial-ovarian-and-fallopian-tubal-cancer/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. For women without <em>BRCA</em> mutations, there is increasing interest in salpingectomy alone as a procedure to prevent ovarian cancer. However, there are few data on this and this approach has not been studied in women with <em>BRCA</em> mutations.

Procedural concerns include: (1) it is unclear whether the surgeon can remove the entire fimbriated end of the fallopian tube without performing oophorectomy, and this may be the most likely site of tubal malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-reducing-bilateral-salpingo-oophorectomy-in-women-at-high-risk-of-epithelial-ovarian-and-fallopian-tubal-cancer/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]; (2) tubal epithelium and endosalpingiosis implants are often present on the adjacent surface of the ovary and across the mesovarium; and (3) use of bipolar cautery devices to perform salpingectomy may cause unintended damage to ovarian cortex or collateral vessels. Some have proposed a &quot;radical salpingectomy&quot; in which the adjacent ovarian cortex is resected in continuity with the tube. Thus, while the question of a more limited procedure for risk reduction is certainly worthy of study, the standard of care is still BSO.
