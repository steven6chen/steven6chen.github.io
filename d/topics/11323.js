In patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia of unclear etiology, manometry helps to determine the underlying cause and can identify patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia who may benefit from surgical myotomy.

Manometry serves to exclude an alternative diagnoses, such as scleroderma or achalasia, for which antireflux surgery may be contraindicated. In addition, manometry may lead to a modification of the surgical approach or a change in management; however, this is controversial. Esophageal manometry is not diagnostic for GERD and manometry cannot predict disease severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Non-specific manometric findings that may be seen in patients with GERD include impaired peristalsis, decreased peristaltic amplitude, hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter, and excessive transient relaxations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux in adults&quot;, section on 'Esophageal manometry'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of gastroesophageal reflux in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Noncardiac chest pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GERD is the most common cause of noncardiac chest pain. Esophageal manometry should be performed to exclude an esophageal motility disorder in patients who fail to respond to eight weeks of proton pump inhibitor therapy for empiric treatment of GERD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-chest-pain-of-esophageal-origin#H24735254\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with chest pain of esophageal origin&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic strategies and initial management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H665290453\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Esophageal manometry may be performed using conventional manometry or high resolution manometry (HRM). The main difference between the two manometric systems is the number of pressure sensors found on the esophageal catheters. HRM catheters use a higher number of pressure sensors (available in 20 to 36 channels) separated by 1 cm as compared with conventional manometry which uses catheters with four to eight &#160;pressure sensors spaced at 3 to 5 cm intervals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77263\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77263 \">figure 1</a>). HRM has a higher accuracy for assessing pressure changes, especially in the sphincters as&nbsp;compared with conventional manometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. When available, HRM is therefore the preferred manometric technique for the assessment of esophageal motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-resolution-manometry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High resolution manometry&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The esophageal manometry catheter is a long, flexible, polyvinyl chloride or silicone tube that is placed in the patient&rsquo;s esophagus. The distal tip of the catheter lies in the stomach and is slightly curved and may be weighted to facilitate passage into the stomach. Catheter diameters range from 2.7 to 4.7 mm and the number of sensors ranges from 4 to 36. There are two types of manometry catheter systems:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Water-perfused system &ndash; The water-perfused system contains multiple capillary tubes running longitudinally. The proximal ends of the capillary tubes extend beyond the catheter outside of the patient, and are connected to external transducers. The external transducers are connected to a water-perfusion pump and a data <span class=\"nowrap\">recorder/computer</span>. Pressure changes generated by the esophagus or lower esophageal sphincter (LES) are transmitted via the radial ports in the catheters, through the capillary tubes, and back to the external transducers and data recorder. The water-perfused system has the advantage of being relatively durable and inexpensive. Its disadvantages include the need for skilled personnel in its maintenance and use, and its inability to accurately record pharyngeal pressures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Solid-state system &ndash; Given its relatively broad and rapid response to pressure changes, the solid state system is suitable for recording any intraluminal pressure activity, including that of the pharynx, and its baseline is not affected by body position. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1999386206\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient protocol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the manometric catheter is positioned, the patient undergoes a 10-swallow protocol in the supine or semi-upright position consisting of 10 swallows, each using 5 mL of water.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2099287576\"><span class=\"h3\">Analysis and interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Manometric evaluation using conventional manometry involves assessment of peristalsis and upper and lower esophageal sphincter pressures. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Upper esophageal sphincter</strong> &ndash; The major elements of the analysis of upper esophageal sphincter (UES) include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Degree of UES relaxation as measured by the nadir UES pressure, referenced to hypopharyngeal pressure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Magnitude of the intrabolus pressure, as a measure of the resistance to flow across the UES</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Presence or absence of pharyngeal peristalsis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Esophageal body motor function</strong> &ndash; Esophageal motor function is assessed by the amplitude and propagation of the pressure waves.

However, the types of measurements obtained in HRM and conventional manometry differ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

This test involves ingestion of a test standard meal (typically &gt;200 kcal) labeled with a radioactive isotope (99mTc for solids and 111 Indium for liquids) and measurement of the percentage of gastric emptying after one, two, and four hours after ingestion. Although the severity of symptoms does not always correlate with the rate of gastric emptying, delayed gastric emptying has been classified based on the extent of gastric retention on scintigraphy at 4 hours. Excessively fast gastric emptying may be associated with dyspeptic symptoms in some patients. Scintigraphic gastric emptying is discussed in detail, separately.

Most studies suggest that the accuracy of these breath tests in normal and pathologic conditions is less than that of scintigraphic measurements of gastric emptying [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing/abstract/12,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15,16</a>].

Radio-opaque marker study can only assess colonic motility whereas scintigraphy and wireless motility capsule can be used to assess gastric, small bowel, and colon transit times. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2219007506\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiopaque marker study</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The radiopaque marker study is commonly performed by measuring movement of radiopaque markers through the gut. Several different approaches have been used, including single or multiple marker ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Both these methods provide a quantitative assessment of colonic transit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3643904921\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient ingests a high fiber diet (20 to 30 g per day) while abstaining from laxatives, enemas, and medications that may affect bowel function for two to three days prior to the test. Radiopaque markers are ingested, and their passage through the colon is monitored by abdominal radiographs. Markers are counted in the right, left, and rectosigmoid colons (defined by certain anatomical landmarks) and are followed as they move distally until expelled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. For routine clinical purposes, a single capsule with 24 markers is administered on day 1 and followed by single radiograph on day 6 (after 120 hours) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68354\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68354 \">image 1</a>).

Markers progress normally through the proximal colon but stagnate in the rectum in those with outlet delay. Transit in the right colon or left colon is delayed in patients with slow transit constipation. As patients with dyssynergic defecation may also retain markers, a diagnosis of slow transit constipation should only be made after excluding dyssynergia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of chronic constipation in adults&quot;, section on 'Etiology and pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3307566154\"><span class=\"h2\">Wireless motility capsule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wireless motility capsule (WMC) is a method of assessing regional (gastric emptying, small bowel transit, and colonic transit) and whole gut transit times (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77372\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77372 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. The WMC also provides information about gastrointestinal (GI) contractility, such as the frequency of contraction, amplitude of contractions, and motility indexes, for which reference values are available for the gastric and proximal small bowel regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. It is particularly useful for testing individuals with suspected alterations of GI motility in multiple regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The WMC is an ingestible, wireless capsule (26 x 13 mm) with a battery life of at least five days that measures pressure, pH, and temperature as it traverses the GI tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing/abstract/23,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26</a>]. Gastric emptying of the wireless motility capsule appears to occur with the Phase III migrating motor complex, signifying completion of the postprandial phase and return of the fasting state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. It assesses small bowel transit time by a sharp increase in pH on entry into the duodenum and by a fall in pH at the ileocecal junction. However, in 15 percent of patients, this pH drop is not observed and this may be related to the ileocecal valve incompetence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The sensitivity and specificity of the WMC is comparable to radiopaque marker test and scintigraphic gastric emptying in diagnosing slow transit constipation and delayed gastric emptying, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing/abstract/21,22,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22,29</a>]. WMC is well tolerated, has good compliance, and avoids the risks of radiation exposure.

In such patients, biofeedback therapy may improve fecal incontinence by enhancement of the ability to perceive rectal distension and improved coordination of the sensory and strength components that are required for continence. However, there are limited data to support biofeedback in patients with fecal incontinence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fecal-incontinence-in-adults-management#H978871679\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fecal incontinence in adults: Management&quot;, section on 'Biofeedback'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3947565976\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to esophageal manometry, water-perfused, and solid-state catheters exist for measuring anorectal motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Each permits measurements of anal sphincter pressure, rectal compliance and sensation, and anorectal inhibitory reflex, which comprise the essential components of anorectal manometry. High resolution manometry (HRM) is generally preferred as there is no manipulation necessary of the catheter once in place. Three-dimensional HRM anorectal manometry, which has 256 sensors located circumferentially spanning the anal sphincter, has the advantage of assessing for regional defects in the anal sphincter, which may be particularly helpful in patients with fecal incontinence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3191015063\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient protocol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An oral bowel preparation is usually not required. However, an enema is recommended if stool is detected on a digital rectal examination. With the patient in the left lateral position with knees and hips bent at a 90 degree angle, the lubricated probe is gently inserted into the rectum. The probe is oriented with its dorsal aspect corresponding to that of the patient. This allows for detailed reading of measurements from the rectum and anal canal with respect to probe orientation. Anal resting pressure is generally measured over 20 seconds. The patient is asked to squeeze the anus for as long as possible, for a maximum of 30 seconds. The patient is asked to bear down as if to defecate in order to assess changes in anal and rectal pressures and cough to measure rectoanal reflex activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1005317914\"><span class=\"h3\">Analysis and interpretation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anorectal manometry should include an assessment of the following parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anal sphincter function</strong> &mdash; Anal sphincter function is assessed by measurement of resting sphincter pressure, squeeze sphincter pressure, and the functional length of the anal canal. Maximum resting anal canal tone predominantly reflects internal anal sphincter function, while voluntary anal squeeze pressure reflects external anal sphincter (EAS) function. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Maximal resting anal pressure </strong>&ndash; Resting anal pressure is defined as the difference between intrarectal pressure and the highest recorded anal sphincter pressure at rest, and is generally recorded 1 to 2 cm from the anal verge. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Resting anal pressure is dependent on sex and age. The maximal resting sphincter pressure is significantly lower in women and decreases with age. High anal resting pressure may suggest smooth muscle or striated muscle spasm and often occur in patients with anal fissure or anal pain. Low resting anal pressures may be due to internal or external sphincter injury or a patulous anal canal. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Maximum squeeze pressure </strong>&ndash; Maximum squeeze pressure is defined as the difference between the intrarectal pressure and the highest pressure that is recorded at any level within the anal canal during the squeeze maneuver. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Decreased squeeze pressures may be due to patient noncompliance or weakness of the EAS due to muscle or nerve injury. Weak squeeze pressures have a low sensitivity for identifying sphincter injury or a patulous anal canal but higher specificity in detecting EAS or puborectalis muscle injury or a patulous anal canal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Functional anal canal length </strong>&ndash; Functional anal length is defined as the length of the anal canal over which resting pressure exceeds that of the rectum by greater than 5 mmHg or, alternatively, as the length of the anal canal over which pressures are greater than half of the maximal pressure at rest. It is unclear if longer functional anal canal length is associated with a more effective continence mechanism. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rectoanal reflex activity</strong> &mdash; Rapid distention of the rectum induces a transient increase in rectal pressure, followed by a transient increase in anal pressure associated with EAS contraction (the rectoanal contractile reflex), and in turn, a more prolonged reduction in anal pressure due to relaxation of the internal anal sphincter (the rectoanal inhibitory reflex [RAIR]). The rectoanal contractile reflex is a compensatory guarding mechanism that allows a positive anorectal pressure gradient to be maintained during transient increases in intra-abdominal pressure (eg, coughing) and is essential for preserving continence. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with fecal incontinence, anal sphincter pressure is not increased over the intra-abdominal pressure during coughing. RAIR is absent in several conditions, including dysganglionosis, postcircular myotomy, and lower anterior resection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rectal sensation</strong> &mdash; Rectal sensation is evaluated by measuring the lowest volume of air that evokes sensation and a desire to defecate, and the maximum tolerable volume. Rectal sensation may also be abnormal in patients with fecal incontinence. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Changes in anal and rectal pressures during attempted defecation</strong> &mdash; The normal response to attempted defecation consists of an increase in rectal pressure and a relaxation of the EAS. Anal manometry in patients with dyssynergic defecation demonstrates impaired relaxation or inappropriate contraction of the pelvic floor muscles <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inadequate propulsive forces during simulated evacuation. This response can be quantified using the defecation index = maximum rectal pressure during attempted <span class=\"nowrap\">defecation/minimum</span> anal residual pressure during attempted defecation (normal defecation index &gt;1.5). &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;</p><p/><p>Four types of dyssynergic defecation are recognized: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Type 1 &ndash; Paradoxical increase in anal sphincter pressure during attempted defecation with normal adequate pushing force </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Type 2 &ndash; Inadequate pushing force but paradoxical anal contraction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Type 3 &ndash; Adequate pushing force, but has absent or incomplete (&lt;20 percent) sphincter relaxation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Type 4 &ndash; Inadequate rectal push effort and inadequate anal sphincter relaxation (&lt;20 percent) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42686770\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Esophageal manometry assesses intraluminal esophageal pressures, peristalsis, and bolus transit. Esophageal manometry is most useful in evaluating symptoms of dysphagia and noncardiac chest pain, and prior to antireflux surgery for gastroesophageal reflux disease. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Esophageal manometry'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1303580653\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Esophageal manometry may be performed using conventional manometry or high resolution manometry (HRM). The main difference between the two manometric systems is the number of pressure sensors found on the esophageal catheters. HRM catheters use a higher number of pressure sensors (available in 20 to 36 channels) separated by 1 cm as compared with conventional manometry, which uses catheters with four to eight pressure sensors spaced at 3 to 5 cm intervals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77263\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77263 \">figure 1</a>). HRM has a higher accuracy for assessing pressure changes, especially in the sphincters as&nbsp;compared with conventional manometry. (See <a href=\"#H665290453\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both HRM and conventional manometry aim to characterize peristalsis and esophagogastric junction function. However, the types of measurements obtained in HRM and conventional manometry differ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-gastrointestinal-motility-testing/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The HRM metrics utilized in esophageal pressure topography to define esophageal motor function and the corresponding measures in conventional manometry are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F86119\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86119 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2099287576\" class=\"local\">'Analysis and interpretation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for assessment of gastric emptying include (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Stomach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3068822507\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Unexplained nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Persistent dyspepsia despite proton pump inhibitors therapy and normal upper endoscopy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Poor glycemic control despite treatment for diabetes mellitus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Suspected dumping or stasis syndrome following gastric surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Suspected chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most commonly performed test to evaluate gastric emptying is gastric scintigraphy. This test involves ingestion of a test standard meal labeled with a radioactive isotope and measurement of the percentage of gastric emptying after one, two, and four hours after ingestion. Although the severity of symptoms does not always correlate with the rate of gastric emptying, delayed gastric emptying has been classified based on the extent of gastric retention on scintigraphy at four hours. (See <a href=\"#H151654752\" class=\"local\">'Gastric scintigraphy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for small bowel and colon motility testing include chronic constipation, chronic diarrhea, dyspepsia, chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudoobstruction, scleroderma, and malabsorption. Radio-opaque marker study can only assess colonic motility, whereas scintigraphy and wireless motility capsule can be used to assess gastric, small bowel, and colon transit times. (See <a href=\"#H193968025\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel and colon'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wireless motility capsule (WMC) is a method of assessing regional (gastric emptying, small bowel transit, and colonic transit) and whole gut transit times. The sensitivity and specificity of the WMC is comparable to radiopaque marker test and scintigraphic gastric emptying in diagnosing slow transit constipation and delayed gastric emptying, respectively. WMC is well tolerated, has good compliance, and avoids the risks of radiation exposure. However, the WMC is expensive and it is not clear that it provides added clinical value in most patients. (See <a href=\"#H3307566154\" class=\"local\">'Wireless motility capsule'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anorectal manometry is most useful in patients with fecal incontinence and patients with constipation in whom non-mechanical causes of obstructive defecation are suspected. Anorectal manometry can also be used therapeutically as part of biofeedback retraining in patients with non-mechanical causes of obstructive defecation.
