Sleep-related hypoxemia is often associated with daytime hypoxemia, but not always. Isolated sleep-related hypoxemia (fall in partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO<sub>2</sub>] of &gt;10 mmHg or pulse oxygen saturation [SpO<sub>2</sub>] below 88 percent for more than five minutes) has been reported in up to 70 percent of COPD patients, and can occur in patients with daytime oxygen saturation of 90 to 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/3,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coexisting obstructive sleep apnea</strong> &ndash; Moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may be present in 10 to 30 percent of patients with COPD, a prevalence that is similar to that of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/1-3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The coexistence of OSA and COPD has been referred to as the &quot;overlap syndrome&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], although it is unclear whether it is truly an overlap syndrome or just two common diseases presenting together.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypoventilation during sleep</strong> &ndash; Sleep-related hypoventilation is defined as a greater than normal increase in arterial tension of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) during sleep (PaCO<sub>2</sub> of &gt;50 mmHg or rise in PaCO<sub>2</sub> of &gt;10 mmHg for more than 10 minutes compared to wakefulness). The prevalence of sleep-related hypoventilation is approximately 43 percent in hypercapnic patients with COPD, but is lower (approximately 6 to 10 percent) and often limited to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in patients with mild COPD and normal daytime arterial blood gases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/1,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Respiratory effort related arousals</strong> &ndash; Respiratory effort related arousals [RERAs], also described as sleep fragmentation due to worsening of breathing mechanics, can be seen in COPD (see <a href=\"#H10592068\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> below). The prevalence, however, remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/1,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17,18</a>], and the clinical significance may be limited to patients with advanced stages of COPD with greater degrees of hyperinflation and muscle weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. RERAs are accounted for in summary measures of OSA severity and are generally considered to be on the pathophysiologic spectrum of OSA. However, COPD-specific alterations in breathing due to lower airway abnormalities may also contribute to RERAs in patients with COPD.

This sleep-related ventilatory depression leads to modest elevations in arterial tension of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) in normal individuals compared with awake values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In addition, sleep is associated with a loss of drive to upper airway dilator muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>] that leads to the development of partial upper airway obstruction, also known as inspiratory airflow limitation, in normal non-snoring and snoring individuals without sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Reductions in inspiratory airflow can further compromise ventilation and increase PaCO<sub>2</sub>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>COPD can lead to elevations in closing volume, which means that the small airways in the lung are closed during tidal volume breathing and not participating fully in gas exchange. The increase in closing volume in combination with a reduction in functional residual capacity during sleep can exacerbate ventilation-perfusion mismatch and hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>COPD is associated with alterations in respiratory mechanics and gas exchange that can lead to dynamic hyperinflation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. During wakefulness, patients adopt specific mechanisms to minimize hyperinflation (by prolonging expiratory time) and to preserve alveolar ventilation (with pursed lip breathing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Sleep is associated with several changes in respiratory control that interfere with the compensatory mechanisms used during wakefulness. In COPD, reductions in ventilation during sleep can produce marked elevations in PaCO<sub>2</sub> because of concomitant elevations in dead space ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Mechanisms to minimize hypoventilation will exacerbate dynamic hyperinflation, whereas lengthening expiratory time could compromise ventilation during sleep.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A loss of ventilatory drive leads to significant reductions in tidal volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], and compensatory mechanisms to prevent hypoventilation are left to changes in respiratory pattern. An increase in inspiratory time would increase tidal volume but would reduce expiratory time, potentially exacerbating air trapping. Similarly, an increase in respiratory rate would maintain minute ventilation but also reduce expiratory time. In either case, respiratory patterns during sleep in COPD can worsen dynamic hyperinflation by shortening expiratory time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inspiratory flow limitation (IFL) is commonly observed during sleep and even mild degrees of IFL lengthen inspiratory time, further comprising expiratory time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p/><p>Thus, sleep induces specific alterations in breathing pattern that compromise ventilation and increase ventilatory loads in COPD. It has been shown that hyperinflation is associated with reductions in sleep efficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Moreover, the mechanism by which these changes contribute to sleep fragmentation and morning fatigue in COPD is likely due to increased arousal frequency (RERAs) and is under clinical investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by increased collapsibility of the upper airway leading to inspiratory flow limitation, manifest by snoring, hypopneas, and apneas. The interrelationship of COPD and OSA is complicated, as the manifestations of COPD can vary among individual patients. As an example, some patients have a more emphysematous presentation and others have more airways disease (chronic bronchitis) with less air trapping. Increasing lung volumes due to air trapping are associated with improvements in upper airway collapsibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], which may explain why COPD patients with emphysema (pink puffer) typically do not present with concomitant OSA while obese COPD patients (blue bloater) exhibit significant OSA more often. Regardless, the coexistence of OSA and COPD has been associated with more pronounced hypoxemia and hypercapnia compared with COPD or OSA individually.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10592074\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRIBUTING FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with COPD have multiple comorbid conditions that are associated with an increased risk of sleep-related breathing disorders, such as metabolic syndrome (approximately 25 to 50 percent), smoking, cardiovascular diseases, and opioid use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H551816089\"><span class=\"h2\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of obesity (body mass index [BMI] &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> in COPD is increasing, ranging from 25 to 42 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In patients with COPD and obesity, respiratory disturbances and blood gas abnormalities (hypoxemia and hypercapnia) first occur during sleep, when ventilation responsiveness to chemical stimuli is blunted and the wakefulness drive is reduced. In addition, decreases in accessory muscle activity, particularly during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, place an additional burden on the diaphragm, which is already under mechanical disadvantage.</p><p>Moreover, obesity is the strongest predictor for having coexisting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). A BMI &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> increases the probability of having OSA to more than 50 percent in men and approximately 20 to 30 percent in women.

Conversely, oxyhemoglobin desaturation may be obscured by the presence of carboxyhemoglobin, which shifts the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the left [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H924467362\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central sleep apnea is not commonly seen in patients with COPD but can develop in the presence of heart failure or other cardiovascular comorbidities. The primary predisposing condition for central sleep apnea is heart failure with a reduction in cardiac output, leading to Cheyne Stokes type of central apnea. The presence of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (below 40 percent) increases likelihood of having central sleep apnea to more than 50 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-disordered-breathing-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep-disordered breathing in heart failure&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2527825127\"><span class=\"h2\">Opioid use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic opioid use is an increasingly recognized risk factor for SRBD.

In a prospective study, 651 COPD patients, 228 with OSA and treated with CPAP, 213 with OSA but not treated with CPAP, and 210 patients without OSA, were followed for a median duration of 9.4 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Patients with OSA not treated with CPAP had a higher mortality (relative risk 1.79, 95% CI 1.16-2.77) and were more likely to experience a severe COPD exacerbation leading to hospitalization compared with the COPD-only group. In addition, patients with OSA treated with CPAP had no increased risk for mortality or exacerbations compared with patients with COPD alone.

For these patients, nasal high flow of warm and humidified air (NHF) may represent an alternative means to improve sleep-disordered breathing. </p><p>NHF of oxygen or room air through an open nasal cannula was first introduced to improve oxygenation in infants and children with hypoxic respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].

First, in the Nocturnal Oxygen Treatment Trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/13,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,62</a>], a post hoc analysis revealed increased mortality in patients with nocturnal hypoxemia.

Nevertheless, studies examining the effects of nocturnal oxygen administration on outcomes in COPD have been inconclusive due to small sample sizes and high attrition rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/13,17,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,17,101</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Obstructive sleep apnea</strong> &ndash; Several large studies now show that the coexistence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a negative prognostic predictor for both cardiovascular disease and mortality in COPD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. In a retrospective case control study consisting of 10,981 men with OSA, comorbid COPD was associated with a seven-fold increased risk for all-cause mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].

The prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in patients with COPD Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 2 to 3 is approximately 25 percent (22 to 27 percent) and increases to 33 to 53 percent in patients with GOLD stage 4 COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/103,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">103,104</a>]. The combination of OSA and COPD increased right ventricular remodeling compared to COPD alone and may explain the increased mortality compared to COPD or OSA alone. Nevertheless, compared with daytime hypoxia, hypercapnia and reduced forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), indices that reflect OSA severity (such as apnea hypopnea index [AHI] or oxygen desaturation index [ODI]), play a minor role for developing pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-breathing-disorders-in-copd/abstract/42,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,58</a>].
