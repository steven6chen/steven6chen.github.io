Since that time, it has contributed to the survival of many children. Soon after the development of PN, however, it became clear that serious problems were commonly associated with its use. Changes in the gastrointestinal luminal contents, gastrointestinal function, metabolic abnormalities, cholestasis, liver compromise, and blood stream infections were reported. This dampened enthusiasm and led, in some instances, to recommendations against its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The indication for pediatric PN is limited to those children whose gastrointestinal tract is inadequate to support normal growth and development.</p><p>Enteral nutrition should be used instead of or in addition to PN whenever possible. PN should be used only when it is not possible to meet nutritional requirements via the gastrointestinal tract or when there is bowel dysfunction resulting in inability to tolerate enteral nutrition for a prolonged time: 1 to 3 days in infants, 4 to 5 days for children and adolescents, and 7 to 10 days in adults. Enteral nutrition has several physiological advantages as compared with PN and generally has fewer complications. Indications and management of enteral nutrition for infants and children are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of enteral nutrition in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Premature infants have a number of unique characteristics that affect the implementation and safety of PN. These considerations are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parenteral nutrition in premature infants&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20519050\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parenteral nutrition (PN) is inherently nonphysiological because nutrients are delivered directly to the systemic circulation, bypassing the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the portal circulation, which are the usual routes of nutrient entry. Nutrients delivered intravenously through PN avoid the &quot;first pass&quot; effect of passage through the liver. The targets for nutrient intake administered via PN are designed to approximate the nutrient content that reaches the systemic circulation in enterally fed patients. </p><p>The effect of PN on physiology can be placed into three broad categories: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of enteral nutrients &ndash; Consequences of bypassing the GI tract and portal system, including lack of the direct effects of enteral nutrients on enterocytes, and loss of the &quot;first pass&quot; effect </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Missing nutrients &ndash; Sequelae from missing or deficient nutrients in the systemic circulation </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal or imbalanced nutrients &ndash; The effect of nutrients not ordinarily found in the systemic circulation or, if present, in differing amounts or ratios </p><p/><p>Knowledge of which nutrients should be included or omitted in PN, and the optimal nutrient ratios, is based largely on trial and error. Since PN is most frequently used in severely ill <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> malnourished patients, it is not easy to distinguish among the effects of PN, the underlying disease, and malnutrition. As an example, it is well known that malnutrition results in profound changes in the GI tract, with thinning of the mucosa, blunting of villi, and increased translocation. From animal studies, we know that many of these same changes are seen in parenterally fed animals that are nutritionally replete, indicating that some of these effects are due to under-use of the GI tract, rather than direct effects of the PN itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>One of the most profound effects of not using the GI tract is that infants do not learn how to eat. Infants learn coordinated chewing and swallowing foods of different textures and tastes during certain &quot;critical periods&quot; of their development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Infants who are not fed by mouth during these critical periods may fail to develop normal interest in food and the ability to eat. Moreover, their parents may fail to develop normal responses to the infant's cues for feeding. It may take years to overcome the oral hypersensitivity and food aversion that results from a lack of feeding experience during the critical periods. This often leads to a prolonged transition from parenteral feeding to full oral feeds, which can be frustrating to parents and caregivers. </p><p>When the enteral route is bypassed, so are the physiologic consequences of eating. The ingestion of food leads to a surge of hormones, transmitters, and enzymes. These mediators result in coordinated GI motility. Little is known about the alterations in GI motility that are associated with PN. Animal data suggest that motility of the stomach, duodenum, and gallbladder is reduced during PN. The decrease in gallbladder motility may in part explain the increase in gallstones that is associated with PN. Interestingly, PN does not affect motility in the jejunum in dogs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The adverse effects of lack of enteral nutrition appear to be mediated in part by glutamine deficiency, although the clinical implications of this observation remain unclear. Glutamine is the major fuel of the enterocyte. The intestinal cell derives glutamine both from the lumen of the GI tract and from the blood stream. If the GI tract is not used, there is no glutamine in the intestinal lumen for the enterocytes to absorb directly. Since standard PN solution has limited glutamine, the enterocyte may be severely depleted of its main fuel source. In animal models of enterocolitis or intestinal resection, supplemental glutamine promotes recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, clinical studies in humans have generally failed to show benefits of enteral or parenteral glutamine supplementation. As an example, a study in which glutamine was supplied both intravenously and intraluminally to very ill adults with multiorgan failure in an intensive care unit setting found no advantage to added glutamine, and mortality was higher in the glutamine supplemented group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-enteral-nutrition#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Enteral nutrition&quot;, section on 'Glutamine'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-short-bowel-syndrome-in-children#H2573155439\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of short bowel syndrome in children&quot;, section on 'Adaptive agents'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1805036529\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIATING PN</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20519056\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications and contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is partially functional, the enteral route should be used even for a fraction of the required nutrients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Rarely, the GI tract cannot be accessed and all nutrients must be delivered via the parenteral route; this is known as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN). TPN is the last resort when oral intake, enteral feeding, and the combination of partial PN and enteral feeds are not possible. Examples of conditions in which PN or TPN is indicated are given in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90425\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90425 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of enteral nutrition in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>PN is indicated for infants and children who are unable to be fed enterally if nutritional support is expected to be required for seven days or more, except in premature infants and neonates, who may require earlier intervention. The appropriate time for initiating PN depends on individual patient characteristics including age, nutritional status, underlying disease process, and expectations for future nutritional needs. PN should not be used for short periods of time because the risks can outweigh benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Premature and term infants have limited nutritional reserves and are able to tolerate starvation or semistarvation for only one to three days; if it is clear that the infant will not tolerate enteral feeds, then PN usually should be initiated within the first two days of life. Older children or adolescents tolerate four to five days without nutrition support, if they were previously well nourished [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients in this age group who are unable to eat or tolerate enteral feeds should be evaluated within three days, to ensure that PN is initiated within four to five days. Adults can tolerate 7 to 10 days without nutrition support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There is no evidence to support the use of PN to &quot;prepare&quot; a patient for surgery unless the patient is severely malnourished [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2460988335\"><span class=\"h2\">When caution should be used</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PN, whether provided peripherally or centrally, should only be used in patients who are hemodynamically stable and are able to tolerate the necessary fluid. PN should be used with particular caution for children with electrolyte imbalance, renal or hepatic compromise, metabolic acidosis, or alkalosis. Acid-base and electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected prior to starting PN, or corrected by infusions through a separate intravenous line. PN should not be used to correct metabolic imbalances. </p><p>Children and adolescents undergoing treatment for cancers may or may not be malnourished. Their nutritional status plays an important role in deciding on the nutritional support necessary. PN is no more effective than enteral nutrition in children undergoing chemotherapy, as suggested by a meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. No meta-analysis is available for malnourished children undergoing treatment, but several reviews in adults raise concerns about the use of PN in patients undergoing chemotherapy, and the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) advises against its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. No studies have identified individual nutrients that have a positive effect on outcomes. These studies reinforce the concept that PN should only be used when other methods of nutrition support are not possible or have failed. If PN is deemed necessary in children and adolescents undergoing treatment for cancer, then general principles should be followed for the initiation and maintenance of PN in malnourished and non-malnourished patients, as outlined below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20519062\"><span class=\"h2\">Central and peripheral venous access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PN can be administered through a peripheral or a central vein. Central venous access is defined as a catheter whose distal tip lies in the distal vena cava or right atrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Any intravenous (IV) not fitting this definition is considered peripheral. Generally, the choice of central versus peripheral venous access depends on the anticipated duration of the nutrition therapy. The maximum osmolarity that can be delivered via a peripheral vein is 900 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/L,</span> and this constraint limits the amount of nutrients that can be provided by a peripheral IV.</p><p>The osmolarity of a PN solution can be determined with the following equation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p><span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/L</span> = (grams amino <span class=\"nowrap\">acids/L</span> x 10) + (grams dextrose x 5) + ([mEq Na + mEq K] x <span class=\"nowrap\">2)/L</span> + (mEq Ca x 1.<span class=\"nowrap\">4)/L</span></p></div></div><p>Given this osmolarity restriction, it is usually impossible to supply all of the required nutrients with peripheral PN, and central venous access will be required to meet the child's full nutritional needs. Therefore, if an infant or child is likely to need parenteral nutritional support for more than two weeks, a central venous catheter should be placed to meet the nutrition needs of the patient. </p><p>A variety of catheters are used for PN which differ in how they are inserted, how they are fixed in place, and where they terminate. These characteristics determine for what purposes and for how long they can be used. For all catheters that are intended to end centrally, imaging is required to confirm tip position. The main types of catheters and their characteristics are: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Percutaneous nontunneled central catheters &ndash; These catheters are usually inserted via the subclavian, jugular, or femoral veins. This type of catheter is most appropriate for short-term PN of one to two weeks. These catheters are easily removed and can be replaced over a guide wire; however, they are associated with a high infection rate especially those placed via the femoral vein. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tunneled cuffed central catheters &ndash; These catheters are placed surgically. The catheter is tunneled subcutaneously before it enters the vein, commonly the jugular or cephalic veins. This type of catheter is appropriate for long-term PN including home PN. It has a lower infection rate than the nontunneled catheters. The major drawback of this type of catheter is that a surgical procedure is required both for placement and for removal. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) &ndash; These can be placed via any peripheral vein but are typically placed via the antecubital vein. PICC lines are appropriate for medium-term use, up to several months. With special care they can be used for home PN. The major advantage of PICC lines is the ease with which they can be inserted. PICC placement can occur anywhere in a hospital, from emergency room to the patient's bedside with low risk. Because of errors in estimates of insertion length, it is particularly important to confirm central positioning of a PICC line. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Implanted ports &ndash; These are used only for long-term therapies including PN. They may be of benefit when adequacy of catheter care is in question or when body image is important. It also may be helpful if intermittent PN is planned. The subcutaneous port is accessed via a percutaneous needle that can remain in place for hours or up to a week. When not being used, the needle is removed, leaving nothing externally visible. Implanted ports have a low rate of infection, but if an infection does develop, it is difficult to clear, and treatment may require removal of the port. Placement and removal of an implanted port require surgical or interventional radiology procedures. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral catheters &ndash; Peripheral catheters are only appropriate for infusions of PN with osmolarity of up to 900 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/L,</span> and they need to be replaced frequently. These limitations mean that they can be used only for PN in conjunction with partial enteral feeds, and only for a short time (days to one week). The main advantages to peripheral catheters are the ease of insertion, the minimal infection rate and the low rate of other complications.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2864471749\"><span class=\"h2\">Ethanol lock therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regardless of the type of catheter, catheter-related bloodstream infections are a major complication of PN use. Many centers are employing daily ethanol lock therapy in an attempt to decrease bloodstream infections. Typically, enough 70% ethanol to completely fill the catheter is instilled during a time when the catheter is not being used for PN. The ethanol is allowed to remain in the catheter for four hours and then removed. The catheter is then flushed with PN solution. In some circumstances (eg, PN associated liver disease and intestinal failure), there is weak evidence that ethanol lock therapy reduces blood stream infections. However, ethanol lock therapy also is associated with greater risk of thrombus and shortens the life of the catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. At this time there is not enough evidence to recommend its use in all situations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal failure-associated liver disease in infants&quot;, section on 'Prevention of sepsis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20519074\"><span class=\"h1\">NUTRITIONAL ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The need for parenteral nutrition (PN) is determined by a careful assessment of the child's nutritional status and underlying disease. Hospitalized children are at high risk for malnutrition. The nutritional assessment must be repeated at intervals as the clinical situation changes. A complete nutritional assessment includes a dietary history, anthropometrics, metabolic status, and an estimate of the nutritional requirements for the individual patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-nutritional-assessment-in-childhood\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for nutritional assessment in childhood&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20519080\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The techniques for obtaining a dietary history are discussed in a separate topic review (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-history-and-recommended-dietary-intake-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary history and recommended dietary intake in children&quot;</a>). Patients who require PN usually have a very limited diet, or have experienced a catastrophic event that precludes or limits use of the gastrointestinal (GI) route. As a result, the dietary history is abbreviated and generally limited to medical foods (eg, formula feeds). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20519086\"><span class=\"h2\">Anthropometrics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important components of a nutritional assessment are accurate measurements of weight and length or height. For infants 0 to 24 months, these are used to calculate weight for length, and for children 24 months and older they are used to calculate body mass index (BMI). These data are plotted on the appropriate growth curves to determine percentiles and to compare with previous measurements, when available. One method of classifying nutritional status is to compare the child's height and weight with the median for the age (percent of median method) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90447\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90447 \">table 2</a>). Z-scores may be used instead of percentiles, and are valuable because they eliminate age as a variable and allow comparisons at the extremes of ranges. The recommended growth curves and calculators for BMI and Z-scores are presented in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-growth-in-children#H31542395\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of growth in children&quot;, section on 'Recommended growth charts'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>BMI is a good index of adiposity in most patients. In patients with edema or with unusual ratios of lean tissue to fat, measurements of mid upper arm circumference and skinfold thickness can be used to assess body composition. These measurements are inexpensive and easily performed but have limited precision. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-body-composition-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of body composition in children&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Overweight and obese children can have macro- and micronutrient deficiencies that are masked by their over-nourished appearance. Overweight or obese patients are at risk for hepatobiliary disease, respiratory distress, renal impairment, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and infection. These risks should be considered in the nutritional planning for children with obesity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children#H869476\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of enteral nutrition in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Adjustments for children with obesity'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135425541\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW TO PRESCRIBE PN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally, parenteral nutrition (PN) for pediatric patients is tailored to the needs of the patient. This requires a series of calculations and an individualized PN prescription. A step-by-step guide to prescribing PN can be found here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90338\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90338 \">table 3</a>). This is followed by an example of PN calculations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90341\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90341 \">figure 1</a>). Target ranges for macronutrients when initiating and advancing PN are found in another table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90420\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90420 \">table 4</a>). Following these is an example of a PN order form (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90480\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef90480 \">form 1</a>). This order form can be converted to an order set for electronic medical records.</p><p>Many hospitals and institutions have standard PN formulas available. These formulas will often meet some needs of pediatric patients and can be used as starter formulas for PN until an individualized prescription can be prepared. However, standard formulas should not replace the individualized approach, which is detailed below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135425651\"><span class=\"h2\">Initiation and monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to initiating PN, goals for fluids, energy, protein, carbohydrate, fat, electrolyte, mineral, and trace elements are set based on the patient's individual needs. It is important to determine whether PN is to be used for maintenance, normal growth, or nutritional repletion and catch-up growth. Anthropometric and laboratory measures must be obtained at baseline, and repeated periodically after PN treatment is begun to monitor the patient and adjust the PN prescription as needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90423 \">table 5</a>). </p><p>Although the fluid and electrolyte content of PN can be customized to the individual patient, PN should not be used as the sole fluid source in metabolically unstable patients, nor should it be used to correct electrolyte abnormalities. Instead, any significant fluid and electrolyte disturbance should be corrected with separate intravenous fluids, administered via separate venous access. If hypophosphatemia is present, it should be corrected before PN is initiated, because the dextrose in the PN solution will cause an intracellular shift of phosphorus that will further decrease the serum phosphorus level. Similarly, children with malnutrition typically require phosphorus and calcium repletion in quantities that cannot be accommodated in a single PN solution, so additional venous access usually is required.

Nutrients are absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in varying degrees, and the degree of absorption is affected by a number of factors such as simultaneously ingested foods, motility of the GI tract, and function of the digestive process. Thus, parenteral requirements are different and usually less than enteral requirements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H964610478\"><span class=\"h3\">Fluids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parenteral fluid guidelines are based on estimates of needs to maintain normal hydration (&quot;maintenance&quot; needs), and adjusted for increased or decreased losses as necessary. The Holliday-Segar method is most commonly used to calculate maintenance needs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90453\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90453 \">table 6</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-maintenance-fluid-calculation-for-children\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].<strong> </strong>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-fluid-therapy-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance fluid therapy in children&quot;, section on 'Components of fluid therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Many factors affect individual fluid requirements such as age, disease state, hydration status, insensible water losses, and changes in metabolic rate and respiratory rate. Infants and children generally require at least 115 mL of fluid per 100 kcal of energy provided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Fluid losses should be measured frequently and replaced, and the patient's weight should be measured daily to assess the level of hydration. Specific issues that affect fluid needs include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GI losses through a stoma, fistula, or from short bowel syndrome, which can reach 1 to 3 liters daily.

At birth, urinary concentrating ability is approximately 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/kg</span> of water, and increases to approximately 1000 to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mOsm/kg</span> by one year of age. Periods of growth decrease the renal solute load, whereas the renal solute load is higher during times of stress and catabolism<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]<strong>. </strong>Thus, urinary fluid losses are relatively high during infancy and times of stress and catabolism, and lower during times of rapid growth.<strong> </strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insensible fluid losses are higher in infants as compared with older patients, and the maintenance fluid calculation compensates for these differences. Certain conditions can increase insensible losses. For example, fever increases insensible losses by 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/day</span> for each degree of temperature &gt;38 degrees Centigrade<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]<strong>. </strong>Other conditions that increase insensible loss are extensive burns, high respiratory rate, high ambient temperature, and low humidity.<strong> </strong></p><p/><p>Fluid restriction may be necessary for patients who have cardiac disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, head trauma, and renal failure. In such patients, PN composition can be concentrated to optimize the provision of nutrients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20519110\"><span class=\"h3\">Energy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accurate determination of a patient's energy needs for the PN prescription is challenging. Energy requirements vary with age, weight, and numerous other individual patient factors including fever, activity level, underlying disease, and ambient temperature. </p><p>A practical approach to determining energy needs for the PN prescription is to estimate the approximate range of energy needs, based on the patient's age and weight. Guidelines from the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN) outline the following age- and weight-based energy requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preterm neonate &ndash; 90 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&lt;6 months &ndash; 85 to 105 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ge;6 to 12 months &ndash; 80 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ge;1 to 7 years &ndash; 75 to 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ge;7 to 12 years &ndash; 50 to 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ge;12 to 18 years &ndash; 30 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day</span></p><p/><p>After determining the approximate range for the patient's energy needs, the specific target is selected from this range based on the individual patient's characteristics, such as need for catch-up growth, factors that may alter energy requirements, and the patient's tolerance of fluid. Factors that may alter energy requirements are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90455\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90455 \">table 8</a>). A number of alternative methods can be used to estimate energy needs such as the Harris-Benedict Equation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] or the Schofield Equation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These methods are estimates more appropriate for adults. For children and adolescents they must be adjusted based on the weight and clinical status. </p><p>These approaches to estimating energy requirements are clinically practical, but have only fair accuracy. As an example, a study that used indirect calorimetry to measure resting energy expenditure found that the calculated estimates of energy requirements using these and other frequently employed formulas are inaccurate and lead to the prescription of overnutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, in most clinical settings, indirect calorimetry is not available for routine use. Therefore, it is important to monitor the patient's growth response to the PN with serial weights and adjust the energy input as needed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20519116\"><span class=\"h3\">Protein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Targets for protein intake for pediatric patients with normal organ function for age are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]: &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preterm neonate &ndash; 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants (1 to 12 months) &ndash; 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children (&gt;10 kg, or age 1 to 10 years) &ndash; 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adolescents (11 to 17 years) &ndash; 0.8 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span></p><p/><p>Protein needs also depend on severity of illness. Stress factors such as sepsis, thermal injury, surgery, trauma, and stomal losses increase protein requirements. Urinary excretion of nitrogen related to steroids, diuretics, or primary renal disease also can increase the protein requirement. Protein may need to be reduced in conditions such as renal disease, hepatic failure, and inborn errors of metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Once the protein target is determined, the caloric content of the amino acid solution is calculated as a component of the total energy input (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90341\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90341 \">figure 1</a>). PN solutions formulated with crystalline amino acids provide 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/g</span> and are assumed to be approximately 16 percent nitrogen. Available concentrations of stock solutions range from 3 percent to 15 percent, with 10 percent most frequently used. </p><p>Amino acids are categorized according to whether or not they can be synthesized by the human body. Essential amino acids are those that cannot be synthesized by the human body; nonessential amino acids are those that can be synthesized; and conditionally essential amino acids are those that can be synthesized but, under certain conditions, are synthesized in insufficient amounts. Both essential and nonessential amino acids are provided in standard solutions. Cysteine is an amino acid that is conditionally essential for premature and term neonates. It is not thought to be needed beyond the neonatal period, but may be beneficial in some instances. Cysteine is not included in crystalline amino acid solutions because it is unstable. It can be added separately at the time of PN infusion, in the form of L-cystine hydrochloride, which is converted to cysteine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Special &quot;pediatric&quot; amino acid solutions contain a higher concentration of essential amino acids and lower quantities of nonessential amino acids, so that the infants' plasma amino acid patterns mimic those of healthy, breastfed neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Whether these solutions are beneficial to older infants and children is not known, but there is some evidence that they are associated with a decreased risk of cholestatic liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal failure-associated liver disease in infants&quot;, section on 'Amino acid dose and composition'</a>.) </p><p>Energy and protein are closely related. Within limits, the more energy supplied, the less protein required to achieve nitrogen balance. One systematic review found that protein intake of at least 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> and energy intake of at least 57 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day</span> result in positive protein balance in critically ill children who are mechanically ventilated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61819649\"><span class=\"h3\">Fat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Between 20 and 50 percent of energy needs in PN are provided as fat, in the form of an intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fat-emulsion-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fat emulsion</a> (IVFE). For most patients, IVFE is initially prescribed to provide fat at 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day. If tolerated, the fat dose can be advanced to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day (or 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> for older children) if needed to provide adequate energy intake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90420\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90420 \">table 4</a>). The total calories supplied by fat are calculated using the factor 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcals/gram</span> of lipid, or 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/mL</span> of 20 percent IVFE. </p><p>An IVFE emulsion has a high concentration of energy (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/mL</span> for a 20 percent lipid emulsion), and thus increases the caloric density of the PN solution. IVFE are sources of essential fatty acids (EFA: primarily linoleic and linolenic acids), which must comprise at least four percent of total calories to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=micronutrient-deficiencies-associated-with-malnutrition-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Micronutrient deficiencies associated with malnutrition in children&quot;, section on 'Essential fatty acid deficiency'</a>.)</p><p>Soybean-based lipid emulsions (eg, Intralipid) are the most common form of IVFE used in the United States and most other countries. They are rich in omega-6 fatty acids, which have the advantage of supplying EFAs. However, accumulating evidence suggests that soy-based IVFE also may be associated with increased inflammation and liver injury, especially in infants on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>, in a pattern known as PN-associated liver disease, also known as intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD). Newer emulsions, such as those based on fish oil (eg, Omegaven), contain omega-3 fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory properties. A fish oil-based IVFE is available in the United States only under an expanded access (compassionate use) protocol; the necessary forms are available from the <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/InvestigationalNewDrugINDApplication/ucm368740.htm&amp;token=oAZqkwO1kkY6ybdNMPoHzAm8QEb+fKoZ8XGzVlz/jOLDYVA5+xQcA0nAOd4MUXaaVe9ICPmuBqyAK32YQ+5+ABX8lYAg4CRh+wpvb+WLw7J5oNzRYSBp+4f0UfwlmmWffc6ROJi6l3iEEggHO6oEdhUuSNv7bTYfWxdygoqPfVw=&amp;TOPIC_ID=15634\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">US Food and Drug Administration&rsquo;s website</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Preliminary evidence suggests that fish oil-based IVFE may be useful for treating infants with PN-associated liver disease. However, fish oil-based IVFE provides minimal amounts of EFA, so patients are at risk for developing EFA deficiency and should be monitored. A mixed oil emulsion that includes soybean, MCT, olive and fish oil (SMOF) has been developed, and preliminary evidence suggests that it may delay progression of IFALD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The available IVFE are summarized in the table, and their use for IFALD is discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74733\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74733 \">table 9</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal failure-associated liver disease in infants&quot;, section on 'Fish oil-based lipid emulsions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants#H2073001284\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal failure-associated liver disease in infants&quot;, section on 'Mixed oil emulsions'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Other strategies to prevent or treat PN-associated liver disease include limiting the total lipid dose to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day, and avoidance of sepsis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal failure-associated liver disease in infants&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.) </p><p>Excessive doses of IVFE may cause hypertriglyceridemia, especially in malnourished patients, as they have a reduced ability to clear triglycerides. Triglyceride levels as high as 100 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> are well tolerated. However, the dose of IVFE should be reduced if the triglyceride levels are consistently in excess of 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. Carnitine is not present in PN solutions, yet it is necessary for transport and metabolism of long-chain fatty acids. Therefore, carnitine should be added to PN for patients on PN longer than two months, at a dose of 2 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20519128\"><span class=\"h3\">Carbohydrates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucose is the only source of carbohydrate in PN and provides 40 to 60 percent of total calories, or 60 to 75 percent of nonprotein calories. It is provided in a monohydrous form (dextrose monohydrate), which has a caloric concentration of 3.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/g,</span> somewhat less than the concentration of carbohydrate calories in food (4 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/g)</span>. </p><p>For the PN prescription, the target carbohydrate dose is determined by calculating the energy (caloric) needs that are not provided by fat or protein. The doses of protein and fat may vary depending on patient needs: </p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>Energy from carbohydrates = Total energy needs &ndash; Energy from protein &ndash; Energy from fats </p></div></div><p>The result is then converted into grams of glucose: </p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>Grams glucose = Energy (kcals) from carbohydrates &divide; 3.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/g</span></p></div></div><p>After calculating the target carbohydrate dose, the glucose infusion rate (GIR) should also be calculated, to ensure that the hourly carbohydrate dose is in an appropriate range (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90629\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90629 \">table 10</a>). </p><p>The acceptable GIR varies with the patient's age and clinical condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90420\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90420 \">table 4</a>). Adequate quantities of glucose are important because at glucose infusions &lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/min,</span> body fat is mobilized for energy and ketosis occurs. Moreover, the brain uses glucose as the primary source of energy. The brain represents 12 percent of body weight in infants, but only 2 percent in adults. Because of this difference in relative brain size, glucose utilization by infants (6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/min)</span> is far more than adults (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/min)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/18,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,28</a>]. It is also important to avoid excessive glucose; an excessive GIR can cause hyperglycemia, hyperosmolarity, and osmotic diuresis. Excessive glucose can increase the risk of hepatic steatosis. A healthy child can tolerate a GIR of 12 to 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/min,</span> but an ill or malnourished child may not. Thus, the glucose concentration must be carefully advanced in a malnourished patient to reduce the risk of refeeding syndrome, and serum phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium should be closely monitored. Lower GIR targets are used for ventilated patients, and patients with hyperglycemia, sepsis, and cholestasis or liver disease. </p><p>Glucose is available in stock solutions of 5 to 70 percent, as dextrose monohydrate. Concentrations greater than 12.5 percent must not be used in a peripheral vein because the high osmolarity can damage veins. Central lines can accommodate a maximum concentration of 25 percent glucose. Glucose should be initiated in an incremental fashion while monitoring for hyperglycemia (blood glucose &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> and glucosuria. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61819929\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrolytes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrolytes are essential and must be provided in PN. Requirements for sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus are included as a separate component of the PN prescription (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90479 \">table 11</a>). The chloride content of the PN solution is determined by the patient's acid-base status: patients who are acidotic should be given a <span class=\"nowrap\">chloride/acetate</span> ratio of 1:2 or less. The maximum and minimum <span class=\"nowrap\">chloride/acetate</span> ratios are determined by the overall composition of the PN solution. The electrolyte additives typically provide approximately 30 mL fluid per liter of PN. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H618791805\"><span class=\"h3\">Calcium and phosphorus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcium to phosphorus ratio in PN should be close to a 1:1 molar ratio. Ratios lower than 1:1 result in elevated serum and urine phosphorus, possibly due to inadequate calcium and hence decreased utilization of phosphorus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Premature infants have high requirements for calcium and phosphorus, which must be balanced against limited solubility of these nutrients in the PN solution. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parenteral nutrition in premature infants&quot;, section on 'Calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium'</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20519140\"><span class=\"h3\">Trace elements and minerals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trace elements are prepared in standard packages of four, five, or six essential elements. Individual needs vary and, at times, supplements beyond what is provided in the solution or other adjustments are necessary. Key considerations are: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Zinc is frequently supplemented in patients who have excessive GI fluid losses via ostomy output or diarrhea. There is no good parameter to monitor for zinc status, but serum zinc levels and alkaline phosphate are used clinically. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Selenium</a> is an essential nutrient so patients who require PN for two months or more must receive selenium. Selenium is not included in some standard packages of trace elements, so patients on long-term PN need a trace element preparation that includes selenium. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For copper and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=manganese-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">manganese</a>, decreased doses may be required for patients with cholestasis. However, in this case, serum levels should be monitored. Manganese can accumulate in patients with liver disease because it is normally excreted in bile. It is speculated that manganese accumulation can contribute to the development of PN cholestasis. Levels should be checked in patients receiving PN for greater than 30 days. If high levels are found, the amount of manganese should be decreased and levels monitored.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chromium is a contaminant in PN solutions. Serum and urine levels should be monitored in patients on long-term PN with renal impairment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aluminum is a contaminant of PN solutions. Since crystalline amino acids have replaced protein hydrolysates, aluminum contamination has decreased. However, it remains a concern. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires disclosure of aluminum content and concentration on labels of parenteral compounding supplies. Some components of PN including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">calcium gluconate</a> and phosphate salts, still include significant amounts of aluminum. There is no consensus to define &quot;safe&quot; levels of parenteral aluminum intake. Intakes of less than 4 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/kg/day</span> were recommended by the FDA in 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, it is often difficult to achieve exposures under these limits using available products, particularly for preterm infants who typically have high calcium needs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal failure-associated liver disease in infants&quot;, section on 'Other PN components'</a>.) &#160; </p><p/><p>Iron is not added to PN solutions. Instead, it must be administered orally, intramuscularly or intravenously. Iron status should be monitored every three to four months while on PN, by measuring hemoglobin, hematocrit, and iron indices (eg, serum iron, total iron binding capacity, ferritin, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> soluble transferrin receptor levels). Because ferritin is an acute phase reactant, it is not a reliable index of iron stores in patients with inflammation. A measure of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein, can be used to exclude inflammation and validate the results of serum ferritin. Patients on long-term PN are at risk for iron deficiency. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20519146\"><span class=\"h3\">Multivitamin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multivitamins should be routinely included in the PN prescription. Pediatric preparations are commercially available in the United States under the brand names MVI Pediatric and Infuvite Pediatric. Both preparations contain the same quantities of 13 vitamins listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90477\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90477 \">table 12</a>). </p><p>For children 3 kg body weight to 11 years of age, the recommended daily dose of the pediatric parenteral multivitamin preparation is 5 mL. For infants weighing less than 3 kg, a fraction of the 5 mL dose is given. Adult intravenous multivitamin preparations and doses are given to children and adolescents over 11 years of age. Because of recurring national shortages of intravenous vitamin preparations, neither MVI Pediatric nor Infuvite Pediatric may be available. Websites that offer alternatives are given in the section below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20519152\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preparing a PN solution for pediatric patients presents special challenges for the pharmacist because infants and children cannot tolerate high fluid volumes, and they need high concentrations of calcium and phosphorus that are not necessarily compatible. Nationwide shortages of sterile injectable ingredients used for compounding PN have confronted pharmacists and nutritionists. Since 2010, important and sustained shortages have included amino acids, intravenous fat emulsions (IVFE), electrolytes and minerals including phosphate, potassium magnesium and calcium, multivitamins for infusion (particularly pediatric preparations), trace elements, and zinc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>These frequent shortages require each institution or hospital to assess their supplies and develop a strategy for their institution. Prescribing providers should consider whether a nutrient can be safely administered by the oral or enteral route for an individual patient.

Cycling can be initiated when a patient has been stable on PN for at least one week. Generally the time off PN is increased and the infusion rate is increased to compensate, so that the total daily volume of PN is unchanged (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90966\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90966 \">table 13</a>).</p><p>Cycling PN has psychological, developmental, and physiologic benefits. For children, time off the pump allows them freedom of movement and the ability to participate in activities such as attending school and social events. For infants and toddlers, freedom of movement is important as they develop large motor skills. In addition, continuous infusion of PN usually suppresses appetite, and cycling off of PN may allow children to experience hunger, which is helpful when transitioning to oral feeds. Cycling allows the rise and fall of hormones associated with meals. Finally, continuous infusion of glucose can be associated with high levels of insulin secretion, which may contribute to hepatic steatosis and increase hepatic lipogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These effects can often be lessened by cycling of PN. </p><p>Cycling requires careful planning and monitoring, because sudden discontinuation of a high glucose infusion can cause hypoglycemia, especially in children younger than three years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Blood glucose levels should be closely monitored when implementing a cycling regimen. To prevent hypoglycemia, the rate of PN delivery should be tapered during the final one to two hours of the infusion. A standard practice is to decrease the infusion rate to one-half for an hour and then half again for a second hour, prior to stopping the infusion entirely. The patient's blood sugar should then be checked 30 to 60 minutes after PN cessation to assure tolerance. Once the patient is on a stable, cycled schedule and has shown that <span class=\"nowrap\">she/he</span> can tolerate the drop in glucose infusion, frequent monitoring of blood sugars is no longer necessary. This practice of tapering the infusion rate and monitoring blood sugar should be employed whenever initiating cycling or discontinuing PN. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20519164\"><span class=\"h1\">HOME PN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Providing parenteral nutrition (PN) outside of the hospital setting (&quot;home PN&quot;) promotes a normal lifestyle and decreases complications and medical costs. Home PN allows continuation of nutrition support in a more normal environment, facilitates the child's development and permits participation in family and social activities. Home PN is associated with fewer infections when compared with PN in the hospital, if the caretakers are appropriately trained to use sterile technique when accessing the central venous line. Home PN decreases length of the hospital stay, thus reducing the cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Indications for home PN include all those for the hospitalized patient, with the additional provisos of an adequate home environment and support in the home. Home PN should be considered when the duration of PN therapy is anticipated to be prolonged and the patient is medically stable, no longer requiring hospitalization. For infants and children, it is prudent to initiate PN in the hospital. As an inpatient the child can be monitored more closely, the family adequately trained to provide care, and the PN tailored and adjusted to the patient's specific needs prior to discharge. The suitability of the home should be evaluated including assessment of the family members and the safety of the home environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Planning should include contingencies for times when the primary caretaker is not available, when the child becomes ill, when mechanical problems occur, and even for such events as power failure. Federal and state health care programs, along with private medical insurances, have strict guidelines that must be met for reimbursement for home PN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Home PN solutions are frequently compounded as &quot;three-in-one&quot; solutions. That means carbohydrates, fats, and amino acids along with minerals, electrolytes, and vitamins are combined as one emulsion (rather than administering the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fat-emulsion-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fat emulsion</a> as a separate component, as is typically done in hospitals). Having everything in one solution allows easy administration, but adds complexity to the job of the pharmacy to ensure a stable emulsion. </p><p>Home PN should be managed with a multidisciplinary approach including physicians, home nurses, pharmacists, dietitians, and social workers. A reliable home care company needs to be selected that has adequate mixing, storage, and delivery systems as well as staff that are trained and experienced in the management of pediatric patients. Strict monitoring of the patient, with frequent nursing and clinic visits, combined with communication with the family are key factors to achieve successful management of home PN. Suggested follow-up and monitoring protocols are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90423 \">table 5</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20519170\"><span class=\"h1\">PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF PEDIATRIC PN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effect of parenteral nutrition (PN) on the psychological health and well-being of the child and the family is often overlooked, but is critically important. PN requires a high level of care that affects quality-of-life for the patient and family over and above the issues surrounding the child's underlying medical problem. Administering PN is time consuming, expensive, and intrusive into daily routines. Patients receiving PN are often troubled by the inconvenience of high intestinal output, presence of a stoma, altered body image, and fear of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The patient may also need to remain <em>nil per os</em> (NPO) or have a very restricted oral diet, which can be extremely challenging for a child who may not understand the rationale behind this part of their medical treatment. Our society focuses on food and sharing meals with others especially during social and school activities, sporting events, family holiday gatherings, religious traditions, and various day to day activities. For families with children receiving PN who are not able to consume food orally, these seemingly innocent and celebratory times can cause added emotional stress. </p><p>It is important for healthcare providers to recognize and facilitate treatment of the potential psychosocial problems that may arise with the use of PN. Some common problems identified in the literature are anxiety, parent-child conflict, sibling rivalry, peer difficulty, marital discord, loss of employment (due to time away from work required for medical appointments), financial concerns, physical and emotional fatigue, social isolation, disruption of family routines, and food <span class=\"nowrap\">refusal/aversion</span> upon reintroduction of food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Some of these difficulties are amenable to treatment through psychological counseling and support. Early referral to a qualified pediatric psychologist or counselor may be helpful for many PN patients and their family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parenteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2572679883\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

If the GI tract is partially functional, the enteral route should be used even if it is only able to supply a fraction of the required nutrients. A wide variety of underlying conditions may lead to a need for PN (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90425\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90425 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20519056\" class=\"local\">'Indications and contraindications'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PN almost always requires central venous access, which is defined as a catheter tip in the proximal vena cava or right atrium. This is because a PN solution must have high osmolarity in order to meet most or all of the child's nutritional needs, and solutions with high osmolarity cannot be infused through a peripheral vein. (See <a href=\"#H20519062\" class=\"local\">'Central and peripheral venous access'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The assessment prior to prescribing PN includes anthropometrics (primarily height, weight, and body mass index [BMI]), and determination of whether acute or chronic malnutrition is present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90447\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90447 \">table 2</a>). These measures are used to determine the child's protein and energy requirements for the PN prescription. A panel of laboratory tests is performed at baseline (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90423 \">table 5</a>), and the results are used to adjust the fluid and electrolyte content of the PN prescription. An understanding of the child's underlying disease and comorbidities is also important because these determine choices for the PN prescription including macronutrient balance, fluid and electrolytes. Anthropometrics and laboratory measures must be repeated periodically after PN treatment has begun, to monitor the patient and adjust the PN prescription as needed. (See <a href=\"#H20519074\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional assessment'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PN is tailored to the needs of the patient, requiring a series of calculations and an individualized PN prescription. The prescription for PN is created from a series of stepwise calculations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90338\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90338 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90341\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90341 \">figure 1</a>). The ranges for macronutrients when initiating and advancing PN are based on the child's age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90420\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90420 \">table 4</a>), then modified by individual clinical considerations. (See <a href=\"#H135425541\" class=\"local\">'How to prescribe PN'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fluid supplied in PN is based on estimates of needs to maintain normal hydration (&quot;maintenance&quot; needs), and adjusted for increased or decreased losses as necessary. The Holliday-Segar method is most commonly used to calculate maintenance needs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90453\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90453 \">table 6</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-maintenance-fluid-calculation-for-children\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). The fluid requirement may be increased or decreased by a variety of underlying conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90454\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90454 \">table 7</a>). In many cases, PN is given in a volume of fluid that is 30 to 50 percent higher than the maintenance fluid requirements, in order to meet the child's nutritional needs. Any large fluid losses through the GI tract (eg, in children with short bowel syndrome) should be measured and replaced separately from the PN. (See <a href=\"#H964610478\" class=\"local\">'Fluids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Energy needs are estimated based on the patient's age and weight, then modified by individual patient's characteristics, such as need for catch-up growth, the patient's tolerance of fluid, and factors that may alter energy requirements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90455\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90455 \">table 8</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20519110\" class=\"local\">'Energy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Protein needs are also based primarily on the patient's age and weight. These estimates are used to calculate the total protein dose per day, and the energy supplied by that protein (using the factor 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/g</span> protein). (See <a href=\"#H20519116\" class=\"local\">'Protein'</a> above.) &#160; &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fat is supplied by an intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fat-emulsion-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fat emulsion</a> (IVFE), and provides between 20 and 50 percent of energy needs for PN. For most patients, IVFE is initially prescribed to provide fat at 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day. If tolerated, the fat dose can be advanced to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day (or 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> for older children). Excessive doses of fat may cause hypertriglyceridemia, and also may contribute to PN-associated liver disease, especially in young infants. (See <a href=\"#H61819649\" class=\"local\">'Fat'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Carbohydrates in PN are supplied by glucose (in the form of dextrose monohydrate), and provide 40 to 60 percent of total calories. The energy to be supplied by glucose is determined by subtracting the energy supplied by protein and fats from the patient's estimated total energy needs. The dose of glucose is then determined in grams (using the factor 3.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/g</span> dextrose). The glucose infusion rate (GIR, in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/minute)</span> is then calculated from the glucose dose and planned rate of infusion; the acceptable GIR varies with the patient's age and clinical condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90420\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90420 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20519128\" class=\"local\">'Carbohydrates'</a> above.) &#160; &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Supplements of electrolytes and minerals (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90479 \">table 11</a>)), trace elements, and multivitamins are required in PN and are included as a separate component in the prescription. The dose can be adjusted to some degree according to the patient's needs, but PN should not be used to correct significant electrolyte abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H61819929\" class=\"local\">'Electrolytes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20519140\" class=\"local\">'Trace elements and minerals'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20519146\" class=\"local\">'Multivitamin'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cycling PN (infusing the PN solution for less than 24 hours daily) has psychological, developmental, and physiological benefits, and should be implemented when possible. Patients are candidates for cycling when they have been stable on a 24-hour infusion schedule for at least one week, and are able to tolerate higher infusion rates of fluid and glucose. Cycling requires care and planning to avoid hypoglycemia, which may be caused by a sudden discontinuation of a high glucose infusion, especially in children younger than three years of age. To prevent hypoglycemia, the rate of PN delivery should be tapered during the final one to two hours of the infusion, and blood glucose levels monitored.
