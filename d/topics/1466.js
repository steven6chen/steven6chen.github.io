Although these clinical manifestations may develop in a hyperuricemic individual at any point, about two-thirds or more of such individuals remain asymptomatic, never developing gout flares, tophaceous gout, acute or chronic hyperuricemic nephropathy, or uric acid nephrolithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].

For purposes relating to urate crystal deposition, a physiochemical definition of hyperuricemia, based upon the solubility limit of urate in body fluids (ie, the concentration above which a state of supersaturation for urate is reached in the serum) is widely preferred over a statistical definition because of the non-normal distribution of serum urate concentrations in most populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. This physicochemical definition corresponds to urate concentrations exceeding about 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (416 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> as measured by automated enzymatic (uricase) methods in routine clinical laboratory use. These values are approximately 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (60 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> lower than those obtained with colorimetric methods.</p><p>A definition of hyperuricemia appropriate to the non-crystal deposition associations with hyperuricemia (eg, cardiovascular disease) is more problematic for two reasons. One is the high prevalence of urate values exceeding saturation but within two standard deviations of the population mean (eg, an estimated 5 to 8 percent in adult white males in the United States and 25 percent in Taiwan Chinese males) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The other is that associations of serum urate levels with cardiovascular and other disorders are detected at concentrations that are clearly subsaturating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>An alternative suggested by some experts as a practical and clinically relevant definition of hyperuricemia is a serum urate concentration exceeding 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]; this value would integrate an estimated threshold for the lifelong risk for clinical consequences of hyperuricemia with the widely recommended goal range of &lt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> for clinically successful urate-lowering in gout [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/6,7,10,11,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,10,11,17,18</a>].</p><p>There appears to be little dissent from the physiochemical definition of hyperuricemia. Nevertheless, acceptance of a range of serum urate achieved and maintained at less than 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (360 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> as the goal for clinical management of most patients with gout is controversial, although it represents our approach and that of a number of other experts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/6-11,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11,15,16</a>]. This controversy was illustrated by a 2016 American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], which recommended pharmacologic treatment aimed at abolishing the acute intermittent symptoms of most gout patients in preference to monitored serum urate-lowering to a pre-specified goal range. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy and treatment of tophi in patients with gout&quot;, section on 'Goals'</a>.)</p><p>We use a persistent urate level of &gt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (480 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> as the threshold for initiating evaluation and, where warranted, lifestyle <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pharmacologic intervention for management of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. (See <a href=\"#H225119526\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persistent hyperuricemia is a common biochemical abnormality that results from excessive urate production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], absolute or relative impairment of renal uric acid clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>], or a combination of these mechanisms (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urate-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urate balance&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of gout&quot;</a>). As the list of specific genetic, comorbid disease-related, and environmental (drug, diet, and toxic exposure-induced) influences promoting hyperuricemia have been identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F80891\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80891 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66799\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66799 \">table 2</a>), the former categorization of hyperuricemia as either primary (idiopathic) or secondary has given way to the recognition of hyperuricemia as arising from multiple pathways that impact urate production <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> uric acid clearance. The effects upon these pathways lead to development of this risk factor for clinical expression of urate crystal formation and deposition (gout and, less frequently, uric <span class=\"nowrap\">acid-/urate</span> crystal-related renal disease) and, potentially, to associated non-crystal-related disorders. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Potential clinical consequences'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperuricemia is a very common biochemical aberration, detectable in a single determination of serum urate in 20 to 25 percent of adult men and a smaller proportion of women in some populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/12,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,23</a>]. Hyperuricemia in men frequently begins at puberty, when the lower serum urate levels characteristic of children rise into the adult male range. Normal adult male values exceed those in women of reproductive age due to enhancement of renal uric acid clearance by estrogenic compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]; this effect is probably mediated by inhibition of renal proximal tubular uric acid reabsorption by organic anion transporters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Thus, hyperuricemia in women is usually delayed until after menopause; at that point, serum urate values in normal women increase and approximate those in normal men of corresponding age. There is a lesser rise in urate levels in postmenopausal women treated with hormone replacement therapy.</p><p>Although the incidence of gout increases with increasing age in both men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], the incidence rate is appreciable from age 30 in men and only after about age 50 in women. Thus, the urate crystal-related manifestations of hyperuricemia in both men and women occur, on average, about two decades later than the initial physiologic increase in serum urate concentration. This observation suggests that there is a lengthy period of asymptomatic hyperuricemia preceding the occurrence of gout.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIAL CLINICAL CONSEQUENCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three major crystal deposition-related disorders associated with hyperuricemia: gout, urate nephropathy, and nephrolithiasis. Substantial evidence supports the view that persistent asymptomatic hyperuricemia imparts risks for the development of urate or uric acid crystal-related clinical events and that the respective risks are, at least in part, related to the magnitude as well as the duration of hyperuricemia. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Gout'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Chronic kidney disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H54555055\" class=\"local\">'Nephrolithiasis'</a> below.)</p><p>With the exception of acute uric acid nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], the initial clinical manifestations of urate or uric acid crystal deposition are not life-threatening and are readily treatable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uric-acid-renal-diseases#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uric acid renal diseases&quot;, section on 'Acute uric acid nephropathy'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, hyperuricemia has also been associated with conditions that are not due to crystal deposition, but the role of hyperuricemia in these conditions is less well-defined. (See <a href=\"#H54553834\" class=\"local\">'Non-crystal deposition disorders'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H54553593\"><span class=\"h2\">Urate crystal deposition disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asymptomatic hyperuricemia was historically regarded as the initial state in the classically defined progression of gout, preceding the presentation of acute inflammatory arthritis (gout flare), intercritical gout, chronic gouty arthritis, and tophi; however, epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that gout flares, tophus formation, chronic urate nephropathy, and uric acid nephrolithiasis are relatively infrequent, occurring in aggregate in a third or less of individuals with longstanding hyperuricemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Longitudinal studies have documented an elevated risk of gout and nephrolithiasis with increasing degrees of hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria, respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uric-acid-renal-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uric acid renal diseases&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uric-acid-nephrolithiasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uric acid nephrolithiasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Gout</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is clear evidence of an association between the degree of hyperuricemia and the risk of gout. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study followed serial serum urate concentrations in 2046 initially healthy men for 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The annual incidence of gout was 4.9, 0.5, and 0.1 percent for serum urate levels of at least 9, 7 to 8.9, and less than 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (greater than 535, between about 529 and 416, and less than 416 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> respectively. The cumulative incidence of gout with serum urate levels of 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (535 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> or greater was 22 percent after five years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were noted in a second report in which gout occurred in only 12 percent of patients with urate levels between 7 and 7.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (416 and 470 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> over a 14-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Serum urate levels above 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (535 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> had a much greater predictive value for the development of gout. However, this degree of hyperuricemia was uncommon in both series, occurring in less than 20 percent of individuals with hyperuricemia.</p><p/><p>Tophi can occur in patients with chronic hyperuricemia, usually in those with antecedent gout flares. However, hyperuricemic older adults and patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia who are being treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or glucocorticoids for some other reason can develop tophi in the absence of gout flares.</p><p>Risk factors for increasing hyperuricemia and raising the likelihood of gout include increased amounts of alcohol consumption (particularly beer and distilled spirits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]), high levels of meat and seafood ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], diuretic, beta blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and non-losartan angiotensin II receptor blocker use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], hypertension, and obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-urate-lowering-therapy-and-treatment-of-tophi-in-patients-with-gout#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy and treatment of tophi in patients with gout&quot;, section on 'Risk reduction'</a>.)</p><p>Monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition in joints and tendons can be detected by ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/34-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-39</a>], by direct observation during arthroscopic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], and by dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Crystal deposition in joints and tendons may be present in a substantial proportion of persons with traditionally defined asymptomatic hyperuricemia, especially hyperuricemia of long duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/15,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,37</a>]. However, there is a lack of compelling evidence to address whether such &quot;asymptomatic hyperuricemia with MSU crystal deposits&quot; predicts an earlier onset <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> worsened outcomes of clinical gout, which might provide an indication for initiation of urate-lowering pharmacotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]; nor has it been proven that such changes are associated with or influence the onset or severity of hyperuricemia-associated comorbid diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic kidney disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is an association between hyperuricemia and chronic kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], although the deterioration in renal function has generally been attributed to risk factors other than chronic hyperuricemia, and a causal role of hyperuricemia in chronic kidney disease has not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/4,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,42,43</a>]. The hyperuricemia that is nearly invariable in chronic kidney disease is due to a reduction in the efficiency of uric acid excretion and is unaccompanied by hyperuricosuria. This is in contrast to acute uric acid nephropathy as part of the tumor lysis and related syndromes in which urate overproduction is the primary abnormality, leading to enhanced uric acid excretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uric-acid-renal-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uric acid renal diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The extent to which chronic urate crystal deposition contributes to the association of hyperuricemia and chronic renal impairment remains uncertain. Historically, persistent hyperuricemia was regarded as an infrequent cause of slowly progressive chronic renal failure called urate nephropathy, in which the deposition of urate in the renal interstitium was thought to result in an inflammatory reaction and in progressive tubulointerstitial injury. Many of these patients had tophi, and the renal pathologic changes could be viewed as renal tophi. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uric-acid-renal-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uric acid renal diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It has been suggested that hyperuricemia is of no clinical importance with respect to chronic kidney disease until serum urate levels exceed at least 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (773 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> in men and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (595 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> in women, levels that are uncommon and beyond which insufficient data were available to exclude a nephrotoxic effect of hyperuricemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, tophaceous gout has become a less frequent problem, and the chronic kidney disease that is still relatively frequent over time in gout patients could reflect consequences of chronic hyperuricemia unrelated to crystal deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Some patients with gout and chronic kidney disease have a bland urine sediment and hyperuricemia out of proportion to the degree of renal insufficiency. Although these findings are compatible with urate or a &quot;hyperuricemic&quot; nephropathy, such patients may have lead intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Proof of this concept is, of course, important with respect to these neurologic disorders but also pertinent with regard to an increasing number of gout patients in whom the recommended long-term management is pharmacologic lowering of urate concentrations to sub-saturating levels. As an example, an observational study supporting the view that incident gout is inversely associated with the risk for developing Alzheimer disease points to the importance of prospectively assessing this relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H225119526\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest performing an evaluation to determine the cause of asymptomatic hyperuricemia in persons with a urate level in excess of 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (480 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>.

The initial evaluation should include a thorough history and physical examination, with particular attention to intercurrent medical conditions, diet or lifestyle choices, drug therapies, toxin exposure, or a known familial disorder that may result in hyperuricemia. Laboratory testing should include a complete blood count and differential leukocyte counts; a chemical profile, including measurement of renal function, electrolytes, calcium, and liver chemistries; and a urinalysis. Further laboratory determinations are directed to the specific causative factor suspected to confirm or deny the relationship.</p><p>In our experience, initial evaluation will identify one or more of the many causes of hyperuricemia due to increased urate production (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F80891\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80891 \">table 1</a>) or decreased renal uric acid clearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66799\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66799 \">table 2</a>) in about 80 to 90 percent of patients. Modification or extension in the evaluation scheme is sometimes warranted by circumstances such as patient age and the extent to which the urate level exceeds normal. For example, marked hyperuricemia (exceeding 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [600 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> in a child) or 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [720 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> in an adolescent might prompt concern over an underlying lymphoproliferative or myeloproliferative state, a previously unappreciated congenital cardiac or pulmonary disorder, or a previously undiagnosed inherited enzyme defect resulting in urate overproduction. Such results would thus prompt appropriate imaging studies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pathologic, genetic, or biochemical measurements. Similarly, additional evaluation may be warranted among some patients with multiple possible explanations for their hyperuricemia, often including dietary or lifestyle choices or the use of medications affecting urate balance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H72379408\"><span class=\"h2\">Further evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A determination of the fractional urinary excretion of uric acid (FEur), which represents the percent of urinary uric acid excretion per unit of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), should be performed in both men presenting prior to age 25 and women prior to menopause who are without an identifiable cause of hyperuricemia on their initial evaluation (see <a href=\"#H72379402\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above) and have stable and normal renal function; such testing can help to differentiate between causes resulting from overproduction of urate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F80891\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80891 \">table 1</a>) and causes resulting from reduced uric acid clearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66799\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66799 \">table 2</a>).

In this case, urinary uric acid excretion greater than 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (4.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day)</span> or 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> (71 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/kg</span> per day) is defined as hyperuricosuria, while daily excretion below this level is indicative of reduced urinary uric acid clearance (with normal or reduced urinary uric acid excretion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The urine collections for these studies should be done while the individual is receiving a standard diet, excluding alcohol and drugs known to affect uric acid metabolism.

It is the reduced efficiency of uric acid excretion that obligates a higher serum urate concentration to achieve a rate of urinary uric acid excretion that matches production. Similar considerations apply to diuretic therapy.

This observation, plus the lack of an established causal role of hyperuricemia in chronic kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/4,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,42,43</a>] and the other associated disorders, has restrained enthusiasm in the United States for prophylactic antihyperuricemic drug therapy in the vast majority of individuals with asymptomatic hyperuricemia. However, experts in some countries (eg, Japan) recommend antihyperuricemic drug therapy for asymptomatic hyperuricemic persons, especially those with associated diseases such as hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>A 2013 systematic review has emphasized the lack of adequate evidence to support the use of urate-lowering therapy for the treatment of hypertension in patients with hyperuricemia and the need for further clinical trials in this area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/asymptomatic-hyperuricemia/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. This analysis identified only one, small, high-quality, randomized trial that addressed this question.

For these disorders, the risks are, at least in part, related, respectively, to the magnitude of hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria (excessive urinary uric acid excretion). For purposes relating to urate crystal deposition in gout, the physiochemical definition of hyperuricemia is based upon the solubility limit of urate in body fluids, with hyperuricemia defined as serum urate concentrations exceeding about 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (416 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> as measured by automated enzymatic (uricase) methods. Hyperuricemia is also associated with important chronic renal, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorders that are not due to urate crystal deposition, but a causal role of hyperuricemia in these conditions is less well defined, and, thus, a definition of hyperuricemia in this setting is less well established. (See <a href=\"#H75373331\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent hyperuricemia is a common biochemical abnormality that results from excessive urate production, absolute or relative impairment of renal uric acid clearance, or a combination of these mechanisms. Multiple genetic, comorbid disease-related, and environmental (drug, diet, and toxic exposure-induced) influences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F80891\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80891 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66799\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66799 \">table 2</a>) promote hyperuricemia, which is a risk factor for clinical expression of urate crystal formation and deposition (gout and, less frequently, uric <span class=\"nowrap\">acid-/urate</span> crystal-related renal diseases) and is also associated with important non-crystal-mediated comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above and <a href=\"#H54553834\" class=\"local\">'Non-crystal deposition disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperuricemia in men frequently begins at puberty. Normal adult male values exceed those in women of reproductive age due to enhancement of renal uric acid clearance by estrogenic compounds. Thus, hyperuricemia in women is usually delayed until after menopause, when serum urate values in normal women increase and become comparable to those in normal men of a similar age. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are three major crystal deposition-related disorders associated with hyperuricemia: gout, urolithiasis, and urate nephropathy. The risk of gout and urolithiasis is elevated with increasing degrees of hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria, respectively. However, tophus formation, uric acid urolithiasis, and chronic urate nephropathy are relatively infrequent occurrences even in individuals with longstanding hyperuricemia. With the exception of acute uric acid nephropathy, the initial clinical manifestations of urate or uric acid crystal deposition are readily treatable. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Gout'</a> above and <a href=\"#H54555055\" class=\"local\">'Nephrolithiasis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Chronic kidney disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Potential clinical consequences'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperuricemia is clearly associated with hypertension, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and components of the metabolic syndrome, but has not been established as a causal factor in any of these disorders. We do not use urate-lowering pharmacotherapy for treatment of such conditions. (See <a href=\"#H54553834\" class=\"local\">'Non-crystal deposition disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We advise that evaluation of patients with persistent asymptomatic hyperuricemia in excess of 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (480 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> should include a thorough history, physical examination, and limited laboratory testing to identify the following: those who are at particularly high risk for gout flares, tophi, or urolithiasis and warrant urate-lowering treatment; individuals whose hyperuricemia is a sign of an underlying disorder or environmental exposure requiring specific treatment; and hyperuricemia-inducing drugs or toxins that can be removed or substituted, with relief or diminution of the hyperuricemic state. Examples of potentially treatable causes of hyperuricemia include lymphoproliferative and myeloproliferative disorders, psoriasis, vitamin B12 deficiency, preeclampsia, and lead toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H225119526\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a man presenting before age 25 or a woman presenting before menopause with asymptomatic hyperuricemia (serum urate &gt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> and whose initial evaluation fails to identify a cause of hyperuricemia, further evaluation should include determination of the fractional excretion of uric acid using a spot urine or a 24-hour urine specimen that is collected while the individual is receiving a standard diet, excluding alcohol and drugs known to affect urate metabolism. The distinction between overproduction and underexcretion serves to guide further investigation of the underlying cause of hyperuricemia, and, if treatment is necessary, it will be useful in directing the choice of antihyperuricemic medication. (See <a href=\"#H225119526\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H72379408\" class=\"local\">'Further evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H105127737\" class=\"local\">'Marked asymptomatic hyperuricosuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In all persons with persistent asymptomatic hyperuricemia in whom treatable secondary causes have been excluded, we provide counseling regarding the use of nonpharmacologic (lifestyle) interventions to reduce the degree of hyperuricemia. We also provide such counseling to patients with evidence of monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition only on imaging. These lifestyle interventions are very similar to those used for the prevention of recurrent gout, including reduction to ideal body weight by means of adjustment of dietary volume and composition, avoidance of alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages, and regular exercise. (See <a href=\"#H170944346\" class=\"local\">'General measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with persistent asymptomatic hyperuricemia requiring medical therapy for another condition, we avoid medications for the coexisting condition that may promote hyperuricemia (eg, thiazide diuretics for hypertension), and we prefer the use of medications for coexisting conditions that reduce serum urate levels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decrease the risk for incident gout when these choices are acceptable therapeutic alternatives. (See <a href=\"#H170944346\" class=\"local\">'General measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with persistent marked hyperuricemia include individuals with uncommon but identifiable urate-related disorders that carry a high risk for recurrent urolithiasis or obstructive uropathy and persons whose marked hyperuricemia is not accompanied by such high renal risk-associated disorders. In the first case, we use urate-lowering therapy (including xanthine oxidase inhibitor therapy, if necessary) aimed at achieving serum urate levels &lt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (360 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. In the latter case, which includes men with sustained serum urate concentrations greater than 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (773 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> and women with levels over 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (595 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> we also suggest treatment with interventions to reduce levels of serum urate (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We try dietary purine restriction initially and treat with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> if dietary restriction and lifestyle changes are inadequate to reduce serum urate to &lt;8.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (480 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>.
