It's also important to stay away from secondhand smoke (from other people's smoking).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73045456\"><span class=\"h1\">Which medicines might I need?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several different medicines available to treat COPD. Most people use inhalers that help open up their airways or decrease swelling in the airways. The airways are the branching tubes that carry air inside the lungs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67527\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67527 \">figure 1</a>). Depending on how severe your symptoms are, you might need more than 1 inhaler. The doses and choices of medicines you need might be changed as your symptoms change over time.</p><p>The list below gives basic information on COPD inhalers and other medicines, and the table lists the names of COPD medicines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F84043\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef84043 \">table 1</a>). Inhaler medicines are used most often. Other medicines, like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">theophylline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=roflumilast-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">roflumilast</a>, are not used very often. Your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist will explain how to use your inhalers. (See <a href=\"#H73045536\" class=\"local\">'More on this topic'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73045471\"><span class=\"h1\">Inhaler medicines to treat COPD</span></p><p><strong>Bronchodilator inhalers</strong> &ndash; Bronchodilator inhalers are the main medicines used to treat COPD. They help open the airways. They might also help lower the amount of mucus in the lungs.</p><p>Bronchodilator inhalers come in &quot;short-acting&quot; forms that relieve symptoms quickly and &quot;long-acting&quot; forms that control symptoms over time.</p><p>Short-acting bronchodilator inhalers include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Short-acting beta agonists</strong> &ndash; Short-acting beta agonists, also called &quot;SABAs,&quot; include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">albuterol</a> (salbutamol) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levalbuterol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">levalbuterol</a> (levosalbutamol). They relieve shortness of breath quickly by relaxing tight muscles around the airways. SABAs usually come in a &quot;metered dose&quot; inhaler or a &quot;dry powder&quot; inhaler. They can also be taken by nebulizer, which is a machine that turns the medicine into a fine mist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Short-acting anticholinergics</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Ipratropium</a> is a short-acting anticholinergic, also called an &quot;antimuscarinic.&quot; This medicine relaxes the lung muscle in a different way to open airways and reduce symptoms. If you have mild COPD, you might use an ipratropium inhaler only when you have symptoms. If symptoms are more severe or happen often, you might use it every day to help keep symptoms from happening. This medicine comes in a metered dose inhaler and can also be taken by nebulizer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Short-acting combination medicine</strong> &ndash; A combination inhaler has 2 medicines in the same inhaler. Taking them together can work better than taking them alone. These medicines come in a soft mist inhaler and can also be taken by nebulizer.</p><p/><p>Long-acting bronchodilator inhalers include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Long-acting beta agonists</strong> &ndash; Long-acting beta agonists, called &quot;LABAs,&quot; include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">salmeterol</a> (brand name: Serevent), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indacaterol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">indacaterol</a> (brand name: Arcapta), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olodaterol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">olodaterol</a> (brand name: Striverdi). These relax the muscles around the airways like short-acting beta agonists do. But the effects last much longer. LABAs help control symptoms for 12 to 24 hours, depending on the exact one being used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Long-acting anticholinergics</strong> &ndash; Long-acting anticholinergics, also called &quot;antimuscarinics&quot; or &quot;LAMAs,&quot; include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tiotropium-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">tiotropium</a> (brand name: Spiriva), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">glycopyrrolate</a> (brand name: Seebri Neohaler), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=umeclidinium-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">umeclidinium</a> (brand name: Incruse Ellipta), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aclidinium-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aclidinium</a> (brand name: Tudorza Pressair). They help the lungs work better and decrease symptoms over time. They also reduce the risk of COPD attacks, called &quot;flares.&quot; A flare is when symptoms suddenly get worse. There are several types of anticholinergic inhalers. These are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F84043\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef84043 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Long-acting combination medicine</strong> &ndash; Long-acting combination inhalers have both a LABA and a long-acting anticholinergic or steroid in the same inhaler. These are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F84043\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef84043 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p><strong>Steroid inhalers</strong> &ndash; Steroid inhalers work by reducing swelling in your airways. If a long-acting bronchodilator inhaler does not control your symptoms, your doctor might prescribe a steroid inhaler too. Some steroids come in metered dose inhalers and some come in dry powder inhalers. Steroid inhalers are usually prescribed as a combination inhaler that also contains a long-acting bronchodilator (LABA). Each time you use steroids from an inhaler, you need to rinse your mouth out and gargle with water afterwards. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73045487\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I use the different kinds of COPD inhalers?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medicines for COPD come in different kinds of inhalers, and each kind has its own directions.</p><p>For example, you need to prepare metered dose inhalers (also called &quot;HFA inhalers&quot;) before using them for the first time, or if you haven't used them in more than a week or 2. You get them ready by shaking them for 5 seconds, spraying medicine into the air (away from your face), and then repeating these steps 3 times before using the inhaler. On the other hand, you do not need to shake or prime dry powder inhalers (like Diskus or HandiHaler) before using them.</p><p>The medicine for some dry powder inhalers (called single-dose inhalers, like HandiHaler and Neohaler) comes in a pill that you put into the inhaler when it is time to take a dose. The pill does not work if you swallow it. It must be used with the inhaler.</p><p>The soft mist (Respimat) inhaler does not need to be shaken before use, but you do need to insert the canister into the holder and follow a couple of steps to get it ready for use. You will need to prime the inhaler before using it the first time or if you haven't used it in more than 3 weeks (4 sprays pointed to the ground). If you haven't used it in more than 3 days, prime once (1 spray pointed to the ground). Unlike other inhalers, the medicine comes out in a mist.</p><p>Your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can explain how to use the inhaler you are prescribed. Most patients find it easy to use an inhaler once someone shows them how.</p><p>More information about how to use each type of inhaler can be found in the tables:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metered dose inhalers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F72362\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72362 \">table 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry power inhalers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F51020%7EPI%2F109205\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51020 graphicRef109205 \">table 3A-B</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soft mist inhalers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F93600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93600 \">table 4</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73045504\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I have a COPD flare?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have a COPD flare, you might need some new medicines. Or you might need to take medicine in a different way than through an inhaler for a while.</p><p>Medicines for COPD flares include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Short-acting beta agonists and anticholinergics</strong> &ndash; You might need to take these medicines from a nebulizer. A nebulizer might work better than an inhaler when you have a COPD flare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Steroids that come in pills</strong> &ndash; Most likely, you will need to take steroid pills for several days. If you have diabetes, steroid pills can increase your blood sugar.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Steroids that come in an &quot;IV&quot;</strong> &ndash; An &quot;IV&quot; is a thin tube that goes into a vein. It is usually given in the hospital. A person who has a severe COPD flare might need treatment with IV steroids in the hospital.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antibiotic medicines</strong> &ndash; You may need to take an antibiotic if you have a lung infection or if your symptoms are more severe. Most often, the antibiotic is given as a pill. If you need to stay in the hospital, you might need an IV antibiotic.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73045521\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I prevent flares of my COPD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have COPD, you need a flu shot every fall and the pneumonia vaccine at least once. This is because infections like the flu and pneumonia can be very hard on your lungs. It is important to try to prevent them.</p><p>People who have more than 2 COPD flares a year might need a medicine to help prevent them. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Azithromycin</a> &ndash; This is an antibiotic pill that is taken at a low dose. It can help prevent flares in some people, but is not used in everyone with COPD. That's because antibiotics can cause other problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=roflumilast-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Roflumilast</a> &ndash; This medicine comes in a pill you take by mouth. It can help reduce flares, but only in people with chronic bronchitis and severe COPD.</p><p/><p>It is a good idea to keep a list of all the medicines you take and bring it with you every time you visit a doctor or nurse. You can find an example of this kind of list at the following website: <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/ucm079489.htm&amp;token=SHauxSdf9qNc6lLK16E8IOhw8tWkhkVaWidZQDUIbu9gDMhwPSip8u9zifYOMQtFzUgxleN7AXwBD6pfdpaGrA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=85724\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/ucm079489.htm</a></p><p>For more detailed information about your medicines, ask your doctor or nurse for information from Lexicomp available through UpToDate. It explains how to use each medicine, describes its possible side effects, and lists other medicines or foods that can affect how it works.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73045536\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-bronchitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic bronchitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-including-emphysema-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-dry-powder-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your dry powder inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-metered-dose-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your metered dose inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-soft-mist-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your soft mist inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhaled-corticosteroid-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Inhaled corticosteroid medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-including-emphysema-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-treatments-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatments (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
