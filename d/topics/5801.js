When competently performed in patients with good acoustic windows, echocardiography accurately detects pericardial effusions and provides clinically relevant information about their size and hemodynamic importance. The technique is less reliable than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) in detecting pericardial <span class=\"nowrap\">thickening/constriction</span> and calcification as well as small loculated effusions, but can still be extremely useful in these conditions. However, MRI is the preferred imaging modality for identifying pericardial <span class=\"nowrap\">inflammation/pericarditis</span>. </p><p>A 2003 task force of the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) gave class I recommendations for the following uses of echocardiography in known or suspected pericardial disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80742\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80742 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pericardium/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with suspected pericardial disease, including effusion, constrictive pericarditis, or effusive-constrictive pericarditis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with suspected bleeding into the pericardial space (eg, trauma, perforation).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up study to evaluate recurrence of effusion following treatment or to diagnose early constrictive pericarditis.

Echocardiography for the routine surveillance of small pericardial effusions is inappropriate in the absence of a change in clinical condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pericardium/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A more recent document by a task force of the ASE addressed the use of multi-modality imaging in patients with pericardial disease and was endorsed by the multiple professional societies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pericardium/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the echocardiographic approach to evaluating the pericardium, along with normal pericardial anatomy and a brief description of some pericardial pathologic processes. Detailed discussions of pericardial pathology, along with the imaging evaluation of the pericardium in particular disease states, are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL PERICARDIUM</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23111647\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal pericardium consists of two layers: a fibrous outer layer and a serous inner layer. The serous layer is a closed sac with the visceral component lining the epicardium and the parietal component lining the fibrous outer layer. The outer fibrous pericardium produces one of the most strongly reflective or echo-producing areas of the heart, and it normally moves anteriorly with the epicardium. The pericardium is reflected from the pulmonary veins as they enter the left atrium. The fibrous component has attachments to the sternum and to the diaphragm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pericardium/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Normally, a small amount of fluid (less than 25 to 50 mL) is contained within the closed sac of the serous layer. Because of the pericardial reflection at the level of the pulmonary veins, pericardial fluid rarely accumulates in this area because the potential space available decreases abruptly.</p><p>Pericardial fat is also commonly seen on two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography. Accumulation is most common in the interventricular and atrioventricular grooves and on the right ventricular free wall. This normal but highly variable finding is most commonly seen anterior to the heart in the parasternal long axis view and in the subcostal views. The best clues to its identity as fat are its absence posteriorly, normal motion of the pericardium, and low intensity echoes (often seen as faint linear striations) within the pericardial space.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiographic imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When visualized on 2D echocardiography, the layers of the pericardium appears as thin echogenic lines surrounding the myocardium. The normal thickness of the visualized pericardial layers is less than 1 to 2 mm, but it can be difficult to make accurate measurements on echocardiography.</p><p>In the normal healthy pericardium, there is less than 25 to 50 mL of serous fluid in the pericardial sac formed by these layers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pericardium/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The interposition of this fluid between the pericardial layers results in a very small physiological separation of the layers, best appreciated on M-mode echocardiography only during systole (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61898\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61898 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98515\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef98515 \">movie 1</a>).</p><p>When inspecting the pericardium in a real time 2D examination, it is important to appreciate the motion of the heart within it. Normally, the heart and epicardial pericardium move and twist within the parietal pericardium. In the short axis, the motion is due to the twisting of the heart during systole and untwisting during diastole. In the apical four chamber view, the motion is due to both the torsion and the longitudinal muscle shortening. The four chamber sub-costal view is particularly useful in detection of the motion between the pericardial layers. This normal independent motion is impaired or lost when pericardial inflammation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> scarring results in adhesions between the visceral and parietal layers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23111719\"><span class=\"h1\">CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PERICARDIAL PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pericardial abnormalities can result from a number of cardiac and systemic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pericardium/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute pericarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The echocardiogram is often normal in patients with the clinical syndrome of acute pericarditis unless it is associated with a pericardial effusion, which is present in approximately 60 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pericardium/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. While the finding of a pericardial effusion in a patient with known or suspected pericarditis supports the diagnosis, the absence of a pericardial effusion or other echocardiographic abnormalities does not exclude it. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H2298690\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Echocardiogram'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pericardial effusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echocardiography has an important role in diagnosing the presence of pericardial effusion, estimating the size of the effusion, and evaluating the hemodynamic importance of any effusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76287\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef76287 \">movie 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77900\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef77900 \">movie 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66715\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef66715 \">movie 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74765\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef74765 \">movie 5</a>). The size of a pericardial effusion is graded semi-quantitatively: small &lt;10 mm, moderate 10 to 20 mm, large &gt;20 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pericardium/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Additionally, the pericardial effusion should be described as circumferential or loculated and transudative or exudative. Echocardiography is also helpful to determine if the effusion can be approached percutaneously and to assist monitoring during pericardiocentesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion#H5106520\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion&quot;, section on 'Echocardiography'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Loculated effusion and other post operative sequelae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pericardial fluid ceases to be circumferential and free flowing and becomes loculated or compartmentalized as a result of a variety of disease processes, most commonly following cardiac surgery or following pericardial hemorrhage. Pericardial stranding, suggestive of fibrous material within the pericardial effusion, is easily seen on echocardiographic imaging, often as a precursor to loculation of the effusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98514\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef98514 \">movie 6</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-cardiac-injury-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-cardiac injury syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Differentiating between pleural and pericardial effusions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Left pleural effusions can present as large echo-free spaces that resemble pericardial effusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98515\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef98515 \">movie 1</a>). These can be recognized because they appear as very large posterior spaces often without any anterior component. Generally, in the parasternal long axis view, pleural effusions are located posterior to the descending aorta, while pericardial effusions are located anterior to the aorta. Additionally, pericardial effusions only rarely accumulate posterior to the left atrium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Pericardial thickening and constriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pericardial thickening is a commonly encountered echocardiographic finding, but hemodynamically important thickening resulting in constrictive pericarditis is relatively rare. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are both superior techniques for detecting pericardial thickening and for measuring the thickness, though echocardiography can also be useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pericardium/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis#H274012956\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">Pericardial constriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If pericardial thickening fails to resolve, chronic pericardial thickening with constrictive pericarditis can develop. Like cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis is a continuum of impairment of cardiac function that causes restraint or restriction on ventricular filling sufficient to raise filling pressures and decrease cardiac output or cardiac reserve. Pericardial adhesion is often apparent with the absence of detectable motion between the layers of the pericardium, which may be circumferential or occasionally focal. Advances in Doppler echocardiography for the detection of constrictive pericarditis have improved the noninvasive diagnosis of this clinical entity, but, as with the distinction between cardiac tamponade and pericardial effusion, there can be significant overlap between the findings in frank constriction and those in extensive pericardial thickening without hemodynamic compromise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;, section on 'Echocardiography'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiating-constrictive-pericarditis-and-restrictive-cardiomyopathy#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiating constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'Non-invasive testing'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumors of the pericardium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Localized pericardial thickening or the presence of a pericardial effusion can represent manifestation of primary pericardial malignancy, the result of a pericardial tumor from metastatic disease, or contiguous encroachment of a noncardiac tumor into the pericardial space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pericardium/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Pericardial tumors are almost always associated with an effusion. If a large tumor invades locally from the lateral chest, it is often possible to appreciate a locally dense area along the lateral border of the heart. The telling characteristic of these masses is often their seeming immobility during the cardiac cycle; as the heart abuts these masses, they seem fixed in space and can distort the normal chamber contour Thoracic MRI or CT are often helpful in characterizing mediastinal masses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39\"><span class=\"h2\">Absence of the pericardium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal pericardium exerts considerable influence on cardiac motion, providing stability to the location of the heart in the chest, and limits the dilatation of the chambers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical utility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging&quot;, section on 'Pericardial disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After surgical removal of the pericardium, the heart frequently expands, and the posterior left ventricular wall motion may become exaggerated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41\"><span class=\"h3\">Congenital absence of the pericardium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete and partial congenital absence of the pericardium is rare and most commonly noted incidentally during surgery or at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pericardium/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In up to 50 percent of cases, congenital absence of the pericardium is associated with other congenital cardiac defects, including atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and tetralogy of Fallot, among others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pericardium/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. While most patients have no symptoms, nonspecific symptoms including dyspnea, chest pain, and palpitations are present in others.</p><p>Partial or complete absence of the pericardium may be suspected but cannot usually be definitively diagnosed by echocardiography; CT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> MRI are required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pericardium/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Echocardiography in patients with congenital absence of the pericardium may visualize more of the right ventricle than typically seen on routine left parasternal echocardiogram, which is due to enlargement of the right ventricle, excessive motion of the posterior left ventricular wall, and shift of the heart to the left. These changes may result in paradoxical motion of the interventricular septum. All of these findings mimic right ventricular volume overload as seen in atrial septal defect or tricuspid insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pericardium/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The orientation and distance between the transducer and the posterior wall on transthoracic echocardiography have been suggested as diagnostic parameters, but in general, MRI and CT are both preferred imaging modalities that can visualize the pericardium and aid in the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pericardium/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Partial absence of the pericardium sometimes results in herniation of a chamber through the defect and can be a rare cause of chest pain. At the site of herniation, the false appearance of a wall motion abnormality can be created along the line of demarcation. However, if a coronary artery is compressed, a true wall motion abnormality may indeed exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pericardium/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42\"><span class=\"h2\">Pericardial cyst</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of a pericardial cyst is usually suggested by the chest radiograph. Pericardial cysts often occur at the right atrial border and are difficult to detect with transthoracic echocardiography; they may be more readily visualized with transesophageal echocardiography and present as an echo-free space that is more localized and spherical than a pericardial effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pericardium/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Both MRI and CT are preferred methods to confirm a suspected diagnosis of pericardial cyst.
