As an example, in one early series of patients with AIDS, anemia was noted in approximately 70 percent, lymphopenia in 70 percent, neutropenia in 50 percent, and thrombocytopenia in 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The incidence of the various cytopenias correlates directly with the degree of immunosuppression. As an example, the incidence of neutropenia varies from 5 to 10 percent in the early, asymptomatic stages of infection to as high as 50 to 70 percent of patients with advanced disease. The degree of neutropenia may be overestimated from the total white blood cell count due to the associated lymphopenia (as evidenced by the low CD4 cell count).</p><p>However, isolated abnormalities, including neutropenia, may be encountered as the initial presentation of HIV infection. As a result, HIV infection should be considered in the assessment of patients presenting with any type of cytopenia. In fact, in one large series of more than 370,000 Danish patients, baseline neutropenia was identified in approximately 1 percent of all patients; during four years of follow-up, the presence of neutropenia had a stronger association with the incident diagnosis of HIV than any other viral infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>This topic review will discuss the causes, clinical impact, and treatment of neutropenia in patients with HIV infection.

The unexplained finding of a reduced absolute neutrophil count (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-absolute-neutrophil-count\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) warrants further evaluation including screening for HIV. In fact, in one large series of more than 370,000 Danish patients, baseline neutropenia was identified in approximately 1 percent of all patients; during four years of follow-up, the presence of neutropenia had a stronger association with the incident diagnosis of HIV than any other viral infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Significant geographic variability in the prevalence of neutropenia has been observed among different clinical cohorts. In the multinational AIDS Clinical Trial Group Prospective Evaluation of Antiretrovirals in Resource-Limited Settings Study (PEARLS), the prevalence of neutropenia (defined as an absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <span class=\"nowrap\">&le;1300/microL)</span> among more than 1500 participants demonstrated significant variability depending upon the country of origin of enrolled patients. This heterogeneity persisted after controlling for CD4 count, hemoglobin, platelet count, sex, and ethnicity. Prevalences of neutropenia exceeding 15 percent were observed among patients from Malawi, Zimbabwe, Haiti, the United States, and South Africa; in contrast, the baseline prevalence of neutropenia was less than 5 percent among patients enrolled from India and Peru [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The etiology of neutropenia is often multifactorial in HIV-infected patients, representing the combined effects of systemic infection, medications, and HIV itself (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78610\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78610 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many therapies used in the management of HIV, associated opportunistic infections, and malignancies can lead to clinically significant neutropenia.

However, the incidence of neutropenia among antenatally exposed infants was greater among those whose mothers received ART (22 percent) compared with those receiving AZT monotherapy (6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

However, the presence of these antibodies does not correlate with the ANC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, autoimmune destruction is not thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of clinically significant neutropenia. The high prevalence of these antibodies may be secondary to the immune dysregulation and hyperglobulinemia frequently seen in patients with AIDS.</p><p/><p>In addition to these secondary causes, HIV itself is a likely mediator of abnormal hematopoiesis in all cell lines. Many mechanisms have been proposed, including direct infection of early hematopoietic precursors, aberrations of local cytokine and growth factor signaling, and changes in the bone marrow stroma. As an example, early myeloid progenitor cells from healthy individuals display blunted replication when cocultured with the bone marrow of HIV-infected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, circulating levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in HIV-positive patients are depressed when compared with healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPACT OF NEUTROPENIA IN PATIENTS WITH HIV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with HIV infection are more susceptible to serious, often life-threatening bacterial infections of many types, including bacteremia, pneumonia, meningitis, colitis, and soft tissue infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-prevention-of-opportunistic-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of prevention of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.) </p><p>They are also at greater risk for invasive fungal infections with organisms such as Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Coccidioides immitis. Invasive fungal infections are seen more frequently in patients with reduced circulating neutrophil counts; Candida and Aspergillus are common pathogens in this setting. Many factors have been linked to these increased risks among HIV patients, including impaired cellular immunity, frequent usage of central venous catheters, altered mucosal integrity, and injection drug use.</p><p>Several case studies failed to definitively link neutropenia in HIV-infected patients with the development of subsequent bacterial infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Other data, however, suggest that a propensity for infection accompanies a decline in absolute neutrophil count (ANC). The range of findings can be illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A case-control comparison between 118 neutropenic and 118 non-neutropenic patients with AIDS matched for baseline CD4 cell counts found an adjusted relative risk for infection of 2.3 and 7.9 at ANCs below 1000 and <span class=\"nowrap\">500/microL,</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Prospective data from the Women's Interagency HIV Study, a multicenter, longitudinal project assessing the medical course of over 2000 HIV-infected females and approximately 570 HIV-uninfected controls throughout the United States, failed to demonstrate any reduction in overall mortality among women with neutropenia defined as either an ANC <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;1000/microL</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;2000/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Although reduced mortality in neutropenic patients treated with G-CSF has been suggested in retrospective, case-control trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], no prospective trial has confirmed improved long-term survival in HIV-infected patients who receive G-CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect on neutrophil function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Qualitative improvements in neutrophil function may also be observed following use of G-CSF. In one study, for example, a single dose of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> in HIV-infected individuals produced a 3- to 11-fold increase in ANC after 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Polymorphonuclear cells obtained from these patients exhibited augmented fungicidal activity and production of superoxide anions when incubated with Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect on CD4 cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are conflicting data on the effect of G-CSF on the CD4 count. Both a transient increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and no change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] have been described.

Other side effects include dysuria and local reactions at the administration site. Mild elevations in serum aminotransferases, lactate dehydrogenase, and uric acid have also been described. Tachyphylaxis does not accompany long-term use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=introduction-to-recombinant-hematopoietic-growth-factors#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Introduction to recombinant hematopoietic growth factors&quot;, section on 'Toxicity of colony-stimulating factors'</a>.)</p><p>Stimulation of HIV replication or an acceleration of disease progression during therapy has generally not been observed. However, a preliminary report from a study in which G-CSF was given to mobilize stem cells found transient HIV RNA increases in approximately 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This appears to be a more important issue with GM-CSF.

Response in ANC is generally evident in 48 hours. After the ANC reaches the targeted range of 1000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">2000/microL,</span> maintenance therapy with 300 mcg three times each week is common; however, the dose required to maintain the target ANC varies markedly among patients from one to seven doses per week.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pegfilgrastim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pegfilgrastim</a>, a long-acting colony stimulating factor formed by the conjugation of G-CSF with a 20-kD polyethylene glycol moiety, is used for the prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia; its role in the management of HIV-associated neutropenia has not been defined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment with GM-CSF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GM-CSF is not used as often as G-CSF because of theoretical concern that GM-CSF may increase HIV replication. The beneficial impact of recombinant GM-CSF on neutropenia has been well described among patients with HIV. Given its effects on a broad range of blood cells, increases in neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and, least commonly, lymphocytes are characteristic of therapy. Like G-CSF, GM-CSF has demonstrated efficacy in improving the hematologic tolerance of many therapies, including AZT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], and combination chemotherapy regimens for non-Hodgkin lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] and Kaposi sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The starting dose of GM-CSF is generally 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span>. Dose modifications and maintenance schedules are identical to those for G-CSF (with doses between 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per day administered one to seven days a week, titrated to patient response and tolerance).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Possible stimulation of HIV replication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major concern with GM-CSF therapy is the potential for stimulation of HIV replication. This phenomenon was initially demonstrated during in vitro experiments with mononuclear phagocytes exposed to GM-CSF or IL-3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Later in vitro studies revealed upregulation of CCR5 coreceptor expression and enhanced HIV infectivity in fresh human monocytes exposed to GM-CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>In vivo data on the relationship between GM-CSF therapy and HIV replication have been conflicting. In a randomized trial of HIV-infected patients receiving CHOP chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with or without GM-CSF, HIV p24 antigenemia increased initially in the GM-CSF treated group compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. By the end of the study, however, there were no differences between the groups. Comparable increases in p24 antigenemia have been cited with GM-CSF recipients in the absence of concomitant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In contrast to these findings, other studies failed to demonstrate any alterations of HIV replication after exposure to GM-CSF in the context of concurrent AZT therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/34,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,38</a>].</p><p>In vitro studies suggested that GM-CSF might enhance thymidine kinase activity and therefore potentiate the anti-HIV effects of AZT. However, a trial to test this phenomenon in patients failed to demonstrate any potentiation of the AZT effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-neutropenia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H639303\"><span class=\"h3\">Other GM-CSF side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flu-like symptoms, especially fatigue, anorexia, headache, myalgias, chills, and fever are the most frequently noted side effects of GM-CSF. Like G-CSF, bone pain is also reported and may reflect expansion of the marrow by the synthetic growth factor. Eosinophilia is common, while exacerbations of thrombocytopenia and anemia (possibly reflecting a granulocyte &quot;steal&quot; phenomenon) may be infrequently seen. Tachyphylaxis has not been observed.
