The history and physical examination have been reported to have a 95 percent sensitivity but only a 50 percent specificity in determining the cause of erectile dysfunction (ED); therefore, additional diagnostic tests are needed to maximize specificity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F97646\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97646 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important information in the history includes assessment of libido, evaluation of erectile function, determination of the rapidity of onset of ED, and assessment of risk factors for and causes of ED. It is also important to determine any reversible causes of ED. This information plus nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) testing often points toward the cause of the sexual dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F97650\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97650 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61756\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61756 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H593009706\"><span class=\"h3\">Sexual history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines offer an algorithm for evaluating men with ED (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F97646\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97646 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual desire or libido can be evaluated with the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM, or IIEF-5) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F97456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97456 \">table 3</a>), and Sexual Arousal, Interest, and Drive Scale (SAID) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ED can be evaluated using validated instruments, such as the IIEF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F98030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98030 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The IIEF is comprised of 15 questions. An abridged version of IIEF, the IIEF-5 (five questions and also known as the SHIM), or the IIEF-EF (six questions) have also been widely used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F97456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97456 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H349119867\" class=\"local\">'Validated instruments to assess sexual function'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other sexual problems, such as premature ejaculation (PE) and a history of Peyronie's disease, should be identified during the sexual history. It is important to also identify other common causes of ED and reversible risk factors for ED (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction#H2095608\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of male sexual dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>). Finally, a psychosocial history should be assessed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Rapidity of onset</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexually competent men who had no sexual problems until &quot;one night when they could not perform&quot; and thereafter developed ED invariably have <strong>psychogenic</strong> ED (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61756\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61756 \">table 2</a>). This problem may be caused by performance anxiety, issues with the current sexual partner, or some other emotional problem; psychological counseling is the preferred therapy in this setting. Radical prostatectomy or other overt genital tract trauma is a physical cause of a sudden loss of male sexual function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Men who experience a traumatic pelvic fracture or genital trauma may also have psychological ED [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In comparison, men suffering from ED of any other cause complain that sexual function failed sporadically at first, then more consistently.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Erectile reserve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In men presenting with a complaint of inability to develop erections, the presence of <strong>spontaneous</strong> erections is an important clue to a psychological cause and makes a vascular or neurologic cause unlikely. Most men experience spontaneous erections during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and often wake up with an erection, attesting to the integrity of neurologic reflexes and corpora cavernosal blood flow. Information regarding nocturnal or early morning erections can be elicited by history from patient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> partner, but proof may require NPT testing. Complete loss of nocturnal erections is present in men with neurologic or vascular disease. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Nocturnal penile tumescence testing'</a> below.)</p><p>Nonsustained erection with detumescence after penetration is most commonly due to anxiety or venous leak from the subtunical veins. With anxiety, a conscious or subconscious concern about maintaining erectile rigidity activates an adrenergic hormone release, which is detrimental to maintaining erectile turgor and rigidity. Sensate focus exercises may be effective in restoring erectile confidence and competence in this setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessment of interpersonal conflict</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interpersonal conflict is one of the more common, but rarely acknowledged, causes of male sexual dysfunction. Couples' counseling by someone skilled in this area can often be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349119861\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of the partner interview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The partner is an invaluable resource to better understand the degree of ED and etiology of ED in patients. The partner can, at times, offer a perspective on the quality of the relationship as well as other sexual issues affecting the relationship. Furthermore, studies have shown that men with partners without sexual dysfunction were more likely to recover their erectile function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Other studies have demonstrated that the presence of ED in a male partner has a negative impact on sexual function in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H349119867\"><span class=\"h3\">Validated instruments to assess sexual function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most widely referenced ED instrument is the IIEF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F98030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98030 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], which consists of 15 items that address five domains: erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction. An abridged five-item version of this instrument, the IIEF-5 (also known as the SHIM), has also been widely used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F97456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97456 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Testosterone therapy was associated with an improvement in erectile function (as measured by IIEF) when compared with placebo.

However, if testing had been restricted to those men with symptoms of low sexual desire or signs of hypoandrogenism, 40 percent of cases would have been missed, including 37 percent of who responded to treatment with testosterone. One percent had hyperprolactinemia. Similar results were seen in a study of 1455 men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Nocturnal penile tumescence testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NPT testing, once a tedious, laborious, and expensive process performed only in a hospital sleep laboratory, has been simplified. Monitoring devices are now available that provide accurate, reproducible information quantifying the number, tumescence, and rigidity of erectile episodes a man experiences as he sleeps in the comfort of his own bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The data generated can be downloaded to provide a graphic index quantifying erectile activity as either normal or impaired.</p><p>NPT testing is generally performed when the clinician is trying to assess between psychogenic and organic ED. Typically, men with psychogenic ED will have normal NPT results. Patients who are being considered for NPT should be referred to a specialized center that performs these procedures.</p><p>Men with ED and normal NPT are considered to have psychogenic ED, whereas those with impaired NPT are considered to have &quot;organic&quot; ED usually due to vascular or neurologic disease. In comparison, testosterone-deficient hypogonadal men are still capable of exhibiting some erectile activity during NPT studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. However, the penile swelling in hypogonadal men may not be of sufficient rigidity to permit vaginal penetration. The testosterone level associated with ED is uncertain, but one study suggested that serum testosterone levels &lt;225 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> were associated with an increased frequency of ED. The mechanisms by which testosterone deficiency produces ED are discussed elsewhere.

Typically, an artificial erection is induced using a vasodilating injectable agent, such as prostaglandin. The peak systolic velocity and the end diastolic velocity are measured to assess for arterial insufficiency and venous leak, respectively. Understanding the etiology of the ED allows for better targeted treatment options.</p><p>Penile ultrasounds are performed primarily in tertiary medical centers. The penile duplex (ultrasound and Doppler flow) allows the clinician to better understand the etiology of the ED (eg, arterial insufficiency or venous leak). Other indications for a penile ultrasound are penile trauma, priapism, Peyronie's disease, or lack of response to phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors and other medications.</p><p>It is best to refer a patient to a specialist who is experienced in performing a penile ultrasounds, as the procedure can be technically challenging.</p><p>There are several ways to manage venous leak. The most common treatment is the placement of a constriction band at the base of the penis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The subtunical veins are compressed and thus prevent outflow of venous blood. Other methods to mitigate the effects of venous leak are to increase cavernosal arterial inflow. This can be accomplished by using vasodilating agents such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors and intracavernosal injection therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Acquired PE is more likely to be associated with psychological factors, while lifelong PE is more likely to be associated with genetic factors (although data are limited). Management depends upon the etiology, but the mainstays of therapy include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), topical anesthetics, and psychotherapy when psychogenic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> relationship factors are present.

In addition, men who present with ED are at higher risk for subsequent development of cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>].</p><p>Patients with ED without an obvious cause (eg, pelvic trauma), and who have no symptoms of coronary or other vascular disease, should be screened for cardiovascular disease prior to initiating therapy for their sexual dysfunction, as there are potential cardiac risks associated with sexual activity in patients with heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. We suggest that men with ED undergo a medical evaluation with stratification of cardiovascular risk as low, medium, or high (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F97648\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97648 \">algorithm 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F97651\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97651 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].

Men with intermediate cardiac risk should be evaluated further with an exercise stress test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A positive stress test in these patients warrants further cardiac evaluation prior to initiating ED therapy.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

Aside from this psychogenic cause, only radical prostatectomy or other overt genital tract trauma causes a sudden loss of male sexual function. In comparison, men suffering from ED of any other cause describe erectile function that failed sporadically at first, then more consistently.

Most men experience spontaneous erections during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and often wake up with an erection. Complete loss of nocturnal erections is present in men with neurologic or vascular disease. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Erectile reserve'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to the basic physical exam, there should be an assessment of secondary sexual characteristics (body hair, facial hair, body habitus), examination of femoral and peripheral pulses as a clue to the presence of vascular impotence, a breast exam to look for evidence of gynecomastia, and measurement of testicular volume (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F97646\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97646 \">algorithm 1</a>).
