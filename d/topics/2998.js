She should also be asked to measure fasting blood glucose every morning.</p><p>Her thirst, fatigue, and vaginal infection subside soon thereafter.

She has learned a lot about diabetes and its possible future consequences from her reading and support group meetings, and she has made her goal an A1C value below 8.0 percent (although an A1C of well below 7.0 percent would be a much better long-term goal). She is congratulated on the good lifestyle choices she has made and is encouraged to continue with these, but <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> is now added, the dose being gradually increased to 2 grams daily in divided doses.

Because the target A1C has not been achieved, the insulin regimen should be intensified.
