Regional coronary blood flow (delivery) determines the amount of tracer activity within a specific area; close correlation between flow and activity has been demonstrated with the currently available radiopharmaceuticals over a physiologic range of coronary blood flow.</p><p>Perfusion imaging is dependent upon the physical properties of the radiolabeled tracer, its delivery, and its extraction and retention by the myocyte. Both cell membrane integrity and energy utilization are necessary for intracellular extraction and retention of tracer. Thus, retained tracer activity is synonymous with <strong>myocyte viability</strong>. Revascularization of such segments can lead to improvement in left ventricular function.

Intake of thallium into the cell continues via additional extraction of thallium that still remains in the blood (arterial input), and recirculation of tracer that has already been washed out of the intracellular compartment. Thallium may leak out of various regions within the myocardium at different rates, based upon coronary blood flow. Thus, an area that has higher coronary flow may permit the egress of thallium at a faster rate than a region of low flow, demonstrating a &quot;differential washout&quot; of thallium.</p><p>Redistribution often begins as early as 20 minutes following thallium administration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62113\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62113 \">figure 1</a>) and may result in the partial or total resolution of perfusion defects noted shortly after stress imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, post-stress imaging should begin within 15 minutes after the initial injection. The redistribution process allows thallium to assess the relative regional coronary blood flow following stress, and under &quot;resting&quot; conditions, after a single injection of tracer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>However, the estimate of perfusion is different at three to four hours after thallium delivery than under true resting conditions, and it can overestimate the extent of myocardial necrosis. This potential limitation may be overcome by a second injection of a smaller dose of thallium immediately following the redistribution images (&quot;reinjection&quot;).

In experimental models, sestamibi uptake is not blocked by ouabain. Thus, unlike thallium uptake, sestamibi uptake is not dependent upon the Na-K-ATPase pump [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/3,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fraction of sestamibi extracted on first pass by the heart is lower than that for thallium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distribution within the myocardium is proportional to blood flow until approximately two to three times the resting flow levels, when uptake starts to plateau [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Animal models show that sestamibi myocardial activity overestimates coronary flow at low flow rates, as determined by radiolabeled microspheres [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This finding may be attributed to increased extraction of tracers at low flow and, as mentioned above, has also been seen with Tl-201.</p><p/><p>Tc-99m sestamibi has the following advantages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial uptake is proportional to flow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is stable retention of tracer (minimal redistribution)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Simultaneous perfusion and function assessment is possible</p><p/><p>Sestamibi undergoes minimal redistribution over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. This stable distribution has numerous ramifications for the use of this agent:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sestamibi is well suited to the prolonged acquisition times associated with tomographic imaging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The absence of significant sestamibi redistribution necessitates two separate injections of the radiopharmaceutical, one during peak stress and a second while at rest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lack of sestamibi redistribution permits greater flexibility in scheduling since imaging is not mandated immediately after injection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sestamibi can be used to quantify the area of risk in a patient suffering an acute myocardial infarction. As an example, sestamibi can be injected at the time of presentation, and the patient imaged after stabilization in the coronary care unit. Since sestamibi activity reflects myocardial perfusion at the time of injection, defects on these early images indicate the &quot;area at risk.&quot; Subsequent injections and imaging after interventions (eg, thrombolysis) can then be used to demonstrate the amount of salvaged myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sestamibi can be given to patients with chest pain and nondiagnostic findings on ECG, and images taken later, even after treatment of the chest pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71950\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71950 \">image 1</a>). This method permits assessment of coronary blood flow at the time of chest pain, allowing for improved triage and management. As an example, a patient with a normal perfusion study after being injected with sestamibi during an episode of chest pain may be triaged to a less intensive care setting or even home, depending upon the clinical circumstances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The stable retention and high count rates of Tc-99m sestamibi permits the evaluation of left ventricular function as part of a perfusion imaging protocol.

In addition, nitrate administration prior to tracer injection improves the detection of viable myocardium by reducing the perfusion defect size and intensity in the majority of viable regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].

As with sestamibi, there is little myocardial washout over time. Thus, high quality myocardial images can be obtained from five minutes to several hours after injection. The more rapid clearance from the liver with tetrofosmin may lead to less artifact from subdiaphragmatic activity, which is a common problem with Tc-99m sestamibi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Although there is less widespread experience with tetrofosmin compared with the other available agents, the diagnostic accuracy of stress Tc-99m tetrofosmin imaging appears to be similar to that of Tl-201 and Tc-99m sestamibi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].

PET imaging relies on the detection of two 511 keV gamma photons. Typical PET tracers have short half-lives; they must be synthesized and imaged in a short period of time. Like SPECT tracers, PET tracers also must be easily accessible, cost effective, and have a linear extraction over a wide range of myocardial flow.</p><p>The most commonly used cardiac PET tracers are Rubidium-82 (Rb-82), Nitrogen-13 (N-13), Oxygen-15 (O-15), and Fluorine-18 (F-18).

It is eluted from the decay of strontium-82 in a generator, which must be replaced approximately every four weeks. Rb-82 decays by positron emission with a half-life of only 78 seconds. Although this short half-life makes the logistics of imaging challenging, it also allows for the rapid completion of a series of rest and stress imaging studies. The cost of the generator is often a fixed monthly expense, making it economically feasible for larger volume centers.</p><p>Rb-82 based PET imaging has been compared with SPECT imaging with all of the various SPECT tracers in numerous studies and several systematic reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/41-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-45</a>].

When used to measure myocardial flow reserve, Rb-82 PET can predict the likelihood of multivessel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Additionally, several studies in both patient volunteers and animals have compared Rb-82 with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrogen-13-ammonia-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">N-13 ammonia</a> and shown that Rb-82 can be useful in the quantification of myocardial blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p><strong>Fluorine-18 </strong>&mdash; Using F-18, one can create FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose), which is a radiolabeled glucose analog used for metabolic and perfusion imaging, allowing one to distinguish ischemic myocardium from nonviable myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The half-life of F-18 is 110 minutes, and it must be produced in a cyclotron.</p><p>The use of FDG was initially reported in 1986 for the assessment of myocardial viability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In patients with poor ventricular function, FDG-PET showed an increased benefit over thallium or sestamibi imaging in improvement of ventricular function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Since that time, there have been increasing data on the prognostic utility of FDG after coronary revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p><strong>Nitrogen-13 </strong>&mdash; As nitrogen is an essential component of basic amino acids, N-13 allows the labeling of amino acids without altering their physiologic properties. These amino acids are important components to myocardial protein synthesis and metabolism in both normal and diseased states. The neutral component diffuses across the cell membranes where it re-equilibrates with ammonium and becomes trapped intracellularly. In vitro studies have shown that in ischemic myocardium, more N-13 becomes trapped within myocytes with a diminished washout of the tracer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. </p><p>N-13 allows gating of both rest and stress images in addition to quantification of myocardial blood flow. In small studies, quantitative myocardial blood flow with N-13 was reproducible and accurate when compared with estimates using Rb-82 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Its limitations are that it has a short half-life (10 minutes) and is cyclotron produced, and its use requires coordination of a cyclotron operator, a radiochemist, and a stress testing technologist. This short half-life however results in decreased radiation exposure to the patient.</p><p>Additionally, N-13 PET perfusion and flow reserve have long-term prognostic value. Individuals with abnormal coronary flow reserve measured by N-13 PET had significantly higher rates of major cardiac events over a five-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p><strong>Oxygen-15</strong> &mdash; O-15 is important because its ability to freely diffuse across the cell membrane makes it useful for imaging myocardial blood flow. However, its utility is limited by its extremely short half-life of only two minutes and because it is cyclotron produced. It is currently not approved for clinical use in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the ideal myocardial perfusion agent has not been discovered, several single photon agents are available with differing physical properties and applications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60169\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60169 \">table 1</a>).

PET imaging relies on the detection of two 511 keV gamma photons. Typical PET tracers have short half-lives; they must be synthesized and imaged in a short period of time. The most commonly used cardiac PET tracers are Rubidium-82 (Rb-82), Nitrogen-13 (N-13), Oxygen-15 (O-15), and Fluorine-18 (F-18). PET imaging is based on two concepts: myocardial flow and myocardial metabolism. Rb-82, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrogen-13-ammonia-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">N-13 ammonia</a>, and O-15 water all allow an assessment of myocardial flow, while F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) allows an assessment of myocardial metabolism.<br/><br/>For the routine detection and evaluation of coronary artery disease, thallium and technetium-99m agents have proven efficacy and are comparable in terms of diagnostic accuracy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The technetium-99m agents provide improved image quality and more easily permit simultaneous assessment of ventricular function at a lower radiation dose. However, the choice of agent and protocol will depend upon the needs and requirements of the particular nuclear cardiology laboratory (eg, scheduling, availability, etc).</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-properties-of-myocardial-perfusion-agents/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Lebowitz E, Greene MW, Fairchild R, et al.
