The yersinioses are zoonotic infections of domestic and wild animals; humans are considered incidental hosts that do not contribute to the natural disease cycle. </p><p><em>Y. enterocolitica</em> and <em>Y. pseudotuberculosis</em> cause yersiniosis, a diarrheal illness. Illness due to <em>Y. enterocolitica</em> is more common than illness due to <em>Y. pseudotuberculosis</em>. Overall, <em>Y. enterocolitica</em> infection occurs more frequently in Europe than in North America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology of yersiniosis (infection with <em>Y. enterocolitica</em> or <em>Y. pseudotuberculosis</em>) will be reviewed here. The microbiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of yersiniosis are discussed separately.

Healthy pigs are frequently colonized with strains that cause human illness, such as serotype O:3 and serotype O:9. In pigs, the organism colonizes the tonsils and other oropharyngeal lymphoid tissues; from these sites it can be shed into the gastrointestinal tract. <em>Y. enterocolitica</em> in swine herds may spread as pigs are transferred from one pig farm to another, and then can persist on a farm for many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The organisms can contaminate retail pork products, including neck trimmings, tonsillar tissue, tongue, and tripe, and can be transferred to other cuts of meat during slaughter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. <em>Y. pseudotuberculosis</em> has been isolated from a variety of mammals and birds. It causes epizootic disease in European brown hares in Northern Europe, sheep in Australia, and farmed deer in New Zealand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29219577\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transmission of yersiniosis is largely foodborne and occasionally waterborne (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73024\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73024 \">table 1</a>). There are also reports of infection related to exposure to household pets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and transfusion of blood products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p>Pork consumption is a major mode of transmission for <em>Y. enterocolitica</em>. Case-control studies of sporadic illnesses in Belgium and Norway have noted a strong association between consumption of undercooked or raw pork products and yersiniosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In a Swedish study, strains of <em>Y. enterocolitica</em> isolated from retail pork had the same PFGE profiles as patient isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In Norway and New Zealand, yersiniosis has been associated with drinking untreated surface water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16</a>]. </p><p>Yersiniosis has been associated with preparation of chitterlings, an ethnic winter holiday dish comprised of pig intestines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. This was first described during an investigation of bacteremia among bottle-fed African American infants in Atlanta, Georgia in 1989 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Illness was thought to occur as a result of cross contamination of infant bottles or formula during chitterling preparation. </p><p>Other outbreaks related to food contamination have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>], including tofu packaged in untreated spring water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], post-pasteurization contamination of milk, and, in Norway, mixed salad with radicchio rosso [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]. In one outbreak, an infected food handler was a suspected source of contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], although in general, direct fecal-oral person-to-person transmission has not been frequently described.</p><p>In rare cases, <em>Y. enterocolitica</em> septicemia has been observed following transfusion with packed red cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. <em>Yersinia</em> organisms are ferrophilic and capable of multiplying slowly in stored units of red cells at cold temperatures before they are transfused. In one prospective study conducted in 1998 to 2000, the incidence of transfusion associated <em>Yersinia</em> sepsis was 1 in 23.7 million red cell transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The number of such infections could potentially be reduced by testing blood products for bacterial contamination and by reducing storage time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection#H1968901\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection&quot;, section on 'Microbiology'</a>.)</p><p>Data on the transmission of <em>Y. pseudotuberculosis</em> are limited. Outbreaks have been associated with consumption of contaminated lettuce, carrots, and milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29219917\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors associated with yersiniosis include consumption of undercooked or raw pork products, exposure to untreated water, blood transfusion, derangements of iron metabolism (such as cirrhosis, hemochromatosis, aplastic anemia, thalassemia, and iron overload), and other comorbid conditions (such as malignancy, diabetes, malnutrition, and gastrointestinal illness). </p><p>Individuals with thalassemia are at increased risk for yersiniosis, as patients with thalassemia can develop iron overload in the setting of red cell transfusion and the organism is ferrophilic. However, in one series of patients with thalassemia, severe yersiniosis was observed even when the iron burden was not greatly elevated; the reasons for this observation are not fully understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99574057\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE OF DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sporadic yersiniosis has been observed worldwide. The incidence of disease around the world increased substantially in the 1970s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. It has been reported frequently in northern Europe, particularly in Belgium, Norway, and the Netherlands; it is rarely observed in tropical countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The reasons for these geographic patterns are not clear but likely reflect the underlying frequency of infection in food animal reservoirs. In addition, <em>Yersinia</em> has a winter peak of infection, which is in contrast to most bacterial foodborne pathogens, which have a summer peak of infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F103900\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103900 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>The peak in incidence in Belgium reached 14.7 per 100,000 in 1986, and subsequently declined in 2003 to 3.3 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The majority of Belgian isolates are serogroup O:3; 5 percent are serogroup O:9 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In the Netherlands in the 1990s, <em>Y. enterocolitica</em> was the third most common bacterial cause of diarrhea, after <em>Campylobacter</em> and <em>Salmonella</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In Norway, the incidence has declined; the reasons are uncertain but may include a combination of public education efforts to reduce consumption of raw or undercooked pork products, changing dietary habits, and efforts by the meat industry to reduce contamination of carcasses during processing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>The incidence of yersiniosis in the United States is much lower than in Northern Europe and has decreased over time. In the United States in 2014, the incidence of diagnosed yersiniosis was 0.28 per 100,000 or approximately 900 cases per year, a decline from an incidence of 1 per 100,000 in 1996 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Almost all yersiniosis in the United States is due to <em>Y. enterocolitica</em>; between 1996 and 2007, only 1 percent of reported yersiniosis was due to <em>Y. pseudotuberculosis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. There is substantial geographic variation within the United States; in 2014, the highest incidence was in Oregon (5.3 cases per million); the lowest was in New Mexico (1 cases per million) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Between 2006 and 2014, the incidence declined by 22 percent; this may be related to general improvements in meat safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Before 1990, the most common serotypes were O:5,27 and O:8; since 1990, O:3 and O:9 have predominated, as in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>High rates of <em>Y. enterocolitica</em> infection have been described in New Zealand; in one region in 1994, the incidence was reported to be <span class=\"nowrap\">87/100,000,</span> making it more common than salmonellosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The majority of isolates were serotype O:3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p>The incidence of <em>Yersinia</em> infections is highest in young children. In Norway, 34 percent of cases occurred in children &lt;5 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]; in Belgium, 66 percent of cases occurred in that age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In the United States, children &lt;5 years comprised 47 percent of <em>Yersinia</em> infections reported to the Foodborne Disease Active Surveillance program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 1996 and 2009, and the estimated annual incidence was 12.3 per 100,000 among children &lt;1 year of age and 1.4 per 100,000 among 1 to 4-year-olds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Over this time, however, the overall incidence among these two age groups dropped from 9.2 to 1.9 per 100,000. In contrast, the annual incidence among individuals &gt;5 years of age has remained stable at 0.2 to 0.4 per 100,000.</p><p>Although the incidence of yersiniosis decreased over this time among children of all racial groups, the most substantial decrease was among African-American children &lt;5 years old, in whom the incidence dropped from 41.5 per 100,000 in 1996 to 3.5 per 100,000 cases in 2009 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F103900\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103900 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. As of 2007, the highest incidence in children &lt;5 years was noted among Asians. The incidence among Caucasian children remained low, &lt;1 per 100,000. There are no significant racial differences among individuals &gt;5 years old. Yersiniosis is rare among observant Muslim individuals, who do not consume pork [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3696769\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Basic tenets of safe food production and preparation are important for prevention of yersiniosis (<a href=\"http://www.foodsafety.gov/&amp;token=pLizOmZw9W6EeEb96w2AMzmEGP9bXjeJMe5AqbUEqQQAnH20BaLnqu0CrfiOXTRU&amp;TOPIC_ID=3144\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.foodsafety.gov</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-yersiniosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].
