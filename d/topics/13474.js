It is characterized by the failure of relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), often accompanied by a loss of peristalsis in the distal esophagus. Treatment of achalasia is aimed at decreasing the resting pressure in the LES to allow passage of ingested material. </p><p>Achalasia can be treated with pneumatic dilatation, botulinum toxin injection, or surgical myotomy. Laparoscopic Heller myotomy is the most commonly performed surgical myotomy procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical myotomy for achalasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is the endoscopic equivalent of surgical myotomy and a newer technique for the management of achalasia. POEM utilizes the principles of submucosal endoscopy to transform the submucosal layer in the esophagus and proximal stomach into a tunnel, through which esophageal and gastric myotomy are carried out using a flexible endoscope. Because POEM is performed perorally without any incisions in the chest or abdomen, it is a form of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The indications, contraindications, techniques, and outcomes of POEM are discussed in this topic. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and other treatment options of achalasia are reviewed elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achalasia: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although POEM was developed for achalasia, it is increasingly being used to treat other spastic foregut disorders, such as diffuse esophageal spasm (DES) or Jackhammer esophagus (see <a href=\"#H2771030211\" class=\"local\">'POEM for spastic esophageal disorders'</a> below).

Several series have reported the successful use of POEM in children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1285389362\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to performing a POEM procedure, it is crucial to confirm that patients have the correct diagnosis of achalasia or a spastic esophageal disorder based on the following information:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical history and physical exam &ndash;</strong> A standardized, validated symptom assessment form should be completed by all patients, with the majority of centers using the Eckardt score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-eckardt-symptom-score-for-achalasia\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Esophageal manometry</strong> &ndash; Achalasia or spastic esophageal disorders are subclassified according to the Chicago classification of esophageal motility disorders, which is based upon the result of a high-resolution esophageal manometry test. The clinical significance of this classification, however, has been debated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-resolution-manometry#H22510878\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High resolution manometry&quot;, section on 'Classification of motility disorders by esophageal pressure topography (EPT)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Contrast esophagram</strong> &ndash; Findings on contrast esophagram that are suggestive of achalasia include a narrowed esophagogastric junction with a &quot;bird-beak&quot; appearance and esophageal aperistalsis. In patients with late- or end-stage achalasia, the esophagus may appear significantly dilated (ie, megaesophagus), angulated, and tortuous, giving it a sigmoid shape. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)</strong> &ndash; EGD may reveal a dilated esophagus that contains residual material, sometimes in large quantities. The esophageal mucosa usually appears normal or with nonspecific changes due to food retention. </p><p/><p>The diagnostic evaluation of achalasia is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2177558\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achalasia: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3135053015\"><span class=\"h1\">OPERATIVE MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2148704688\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients are placed on a liquid diet for one to two days prior to a POEM procedure to ensure a clear endoscopic view and avoid aspiration during induction of anesthesia. </p><p>Anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, with the exception of acetylsalicylic acid prescribed for cardiovascular diseases, should be stopped prior to the procedure. Broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, such as a second-generation cephalosporin, are administered prior to the procedure.</p><p>We prefer to use a high-definition therapeutic gastroscope with both a large suction channel and a dedicated water jet channel for removing food residues in the esophageal lumen. A transparent cap is secured onto the tip of the gastroscope with tape to prevent accidental dislodgement within the submucosal tunnel. Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), which is more readily absorbed than air, should be used for insufflation to reduce the risks of mediastinal emphysema, tension pneumoperitoneum, or pneumothorax. </p><p>POEM can be performed in the operating room or the endoscopy suite. We perform POEM in the endoscopy suite. The patient is placed supine with the abdomen exposed. A thorough cleansing of the esophageal lumen is performed with water or an antibiotic solution prior to any mucosal incision. Any adherent residue present on the esophageal mucosa can be removed using the cap or suction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H305363267\"><span class=\"h2\">Operative technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The POEM procedure is carried out in four consecutive steps: 1) mucosal incision and entry into the submucosa, 2) creation of a submucosal tunnel, 3) myotomy, and 4) closure of the mucosal incision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109285\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109285 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3139432388\"><span class=\"h3\">Step 1: Mucosal incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A mucosal incision is made to allow the gastroscope to enter the submucosal space to create the submucosal tunnel. </p><p>The location of the mucosal incision is determined by the level of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) and the length of the submucosal tunnel required. The length of the submucosal tunnel required is further determined by the length of the myotomy required. In patients with achalasia subtype I or II, a 6 to 8 cm esophageal myotomy is performed. In patients with spastic esophageal disorders, the length of myotomy is typically longer and determined by the proximal extent of the hypertensive contractions as measured by high-resolution esophageal manometry <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the level of visible spastic contractions seen endoscopically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=achalasia-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H1015728645\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Achalasia: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'High-resolution manometry'</a>.)</p><p>In most centers, the mucosal incision, submucosal tunnel, and myotomy are created at an anterior position (2 o'clock) of the esophageal lumen. In other centers, a posterior position (5 o'clock) is favored. The anterior and posterior positions of the esophageal lumen can be distinguished by injecting water, which pools posteriorly with the patient supine. </p><p>Using a mixture of 0.01% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> and 0.25% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a> in 0.9% saline, a submucosal bleb is first raised at a level that is 2 to 3 cm above the proximal margin of the intended myotomy. Either a triangular tip knife or a HybridKnife can be used to make a 1.5 to 2 cm longitudinal mucosal incision using dry cut mode at 50 watts on effect 3 (ERBE). HybridKnife has the advantage of permitting both needleless, high-pressure water jet injection and electrosurgical dissection without accessory exchange. The gastroscope is then maneuvered into the submucosal space after dissecting the submucosal fibers at the mucosal incision with the knife. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3187001994\"><span class=\"h3\">Step 2: Creation of submucosal tunnel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A submucosal tunnel is created toward the stomach using a technique similar to endoscopic submucosal dissection. Using the knife, the submucosa is dissected with a no-touch technique using spray coagulation mode at 50 watts on effect 2 (ERBE) in a plane that is located nearly on the surface of the muscularis propria. Whenever the dissection plane becomes unclear, repeated jet injection of the same mixture of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a>, and saline is performed to enhance the demarcation between the submucosal layer and the muscularis propria. </p><p>The gastroscope must be properly oriented as it is advanced through the submucosal tunnel to preserve the integrity of the mucosal layer. After myotomy, the mucosal layer becomes the only remaining barrier between the <span class=\"nowrap\">mediastinum/peritoneum</span> and the <span class=\"nowrap\">esophageal/gastric</span> lumen. </p><p>Larger blood vessels in the submucosa are coagulated using hemostatic forceps (eg, Coagrasper in soft coagulation mode at 80 watts on effect 5, ERBE) or the HybridKnife. </p><p>The submucosal tunnel is extended until it is 2 to 3 cm beyond the EGJ, passing where the &quot;clasp and sling&quot; fibers maintain the continence of the lower esophageal sphincter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69389\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69389 \">figure 2</a>). Complete division of these &quot;clasp and sling&quot; fibers is essential to the success of myotomy.</p><p>The EGJ can be located endoscopically by multiple methods, including insertion depth, narrowing of the submucosal space and resistance of passage of the endoscope through the EGJ followed by prompt expansion of the space at the gastric cardia, change in vasculature, visualization of aberrant longitudinal muscle fibers at the EGJ, or by injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a> (ICG). When the gastroscope is positioned in the lumen of the stomach, extension of the submucosal tunnel past the EGJ can also be confirmed by retroflexing and visualizing adequate levels of color change caused by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indigo-carmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indigo carmine</a> in the submucosa. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1718851193\"><span class=\"h3\">Step 3: Myotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Selective myotomy of the inner circular muscle bundles is performed starting 2 cm distal to the mucosal incision. Circular muscle bundles are individually lifted toward the submucosal tunnel by the sharp tip of the knife and divided with spray coagulation current at 50 watts on effect 2 (ERBE). </p><p>Selective myotomy of the inner circular muscle proximal to the lower esophageal sphincter with preservation of the outer longitudinal esophageal muscular layer is often performed during POEM to avoid entering the pleural space. When performed by less-experienced operators, such technique adds a &quot;safety net&quot; to the procedure. </p><p>However, selective myotomy is often hard to achieve because the longitudinal muscle fibers of the esophagus are extremely thin and prone to splitting during dissection. Furthermore, the plane that separates the circular and longitudinal muscular layers becomes difficult to delineate beyond the esophagus. </p><p>The optimal depth of myotomy is not known; the advantages of selective inner circular muscle versus full-thickness myotomy are only theoretical. One retrospective study suggested that both techniques were equally effective and safe, although full-thickness myotomy was associated with a shorter procedure time. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3660635385\"><span class=\"h3\">Step 4: Closure of mucosal incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before closure of the mucosal incision, a careful inspection of the submucosal tunnel is performed and any bleeding is controlled. The esophageal mucosa is then inspected, and any incidental tear (ie, mucosotomy) is closed. Adequate lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation is confirmed by a retroflexed view of the gastric cardia. </p><p>Closure of the mucosal incision can be performed with endoscopic clips or with an endoluminal suturing device (eg, OverStitch). When endoscopic clips are used, the initial clip is placed at the most distal part of the incision to facilitate approximation of the incision borders. Subsequent clips are then placed in a distal to proximal direction until the mucosal incision is completely closed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2283908473\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient care after POEM procedures has not been standardized. In our practice, patients are admitted to the hospital for overnight observation and kept nil per os (NPO) and given antibiotics and antiemetics prophylactically. </p><p>We obtain an esophagram on the day after the procedure to exclude an esophageal leak, after which a soft diet is allowed. Patients are advised to remain on a soft diet for 10 to 14 days before starting a regular diet. </p><p>In our practice, patients are routinely prescribed antibiotics for approximately three to five days and twice-daily proton pump inhibitors for two weeks after POEM to protect the vulnerable esophageal mucosa. </p><p>During subsequent clinic visits, patients are assessed for any delayed complications and clinical response to POEM (eg, by Eckardt score) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-eckardt-symptom-score-for-achalasia\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1443112471\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES OF POEM FOR ACHALASIA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H310833763\"><span class=\"h2\">POEM for primary achalasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>POEM is highly efficacious in the short-term management of achalasia. According to a 2014 summary of 14 studies of POEM, clinical success, defined as a post-treatment Eckardt score of &le;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a &gt;50 percent decrease in the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, was achieved in 82 to 100 percent of patients. Other studies documented similar patient improvements after POEM using either timed barium esophagram or quality of life assessment.</p><p>Three studies provided data on intermediate to long-term efficacies of POEM: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a German retrospective study of 80 patients who were followed for &ge;2 years after POEM, 77 patients (96 percent) achieved initial clinical response, of which 14 (18 percent) developed recurrent achalasia, making the overall success rate of POEM 78 percent at 24 to 49 months. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Japanese retrospective study of 500 consecutive patients (of which 61 patients were followed for three years or longer), clinical success was observed in 91 percent at one to two years after POEM, which decreased to 88 percent at three years..</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an American retrospective study of 115 patients who underwent POEM at a single high-volume center, the overall success rate was 92 percent at an average of 28 months (range 12 to 52 months). The success rate was slightly higher for nonspastic achalasia (94 percent) than for type III achalasia or spastic motility disorders (90 percent) (see <a href=\"#H2771030211\" class=\"local\">'POEM for spastic esophageal disorders'</a> below). Major and minor complications occurred in 2.7 and 15.2 percent of patients, respectively. After POEM, objective evidence of reflux was found in 40 percent of all patients and 33 percent of patients with a body mass index of &lt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> and no hiatal hernia.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1608378507\"><span class=\"h3\">Comparison with surgical myotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy and safety of POEM has been compared with that of laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM). In a meta-analysis of over 7000 patients in over 70 cohort studies, POEM was more effective than LHM in relieving dysphagia. Predicted probabilities for improvement in dysphagia at 12 months were 93.5 percent for POEM and 91.0 percent for LHM, and at 24 months were 92.7 percent for POEM and 90.0 percent for LHM; both differences were statistically significant. However, POEM was associated with higher incidences of pathologic reflux by multiple measurements (symptoms, erosive esophagitis, and abnormal pH studies) and a slightly longer hospital stay (by one day) than LHM. Studies on LHM had significantly longer follow-up than POEM (41.5 versus 16.2 months); longer-term data on POEM are required before the durability of the two procedures can be directly compared. Until then, patients eligible for both procedures may choose one based on the clinical situation, available local resources, and <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/surgeon</span> preference. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-myotomy-for-achalasia#H3227471\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical myotomy for achalasia&quot;, section on 'Fundoplication'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2871403848\"><span class=\"h2\">POEM for recurrent achalasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>POEM has been shown to be feasible, safe, and effective in treating patients who have failed other prior endoscopic or surgical treatment for achalasia. </p><p>According to the International Per Oral Endoscopic Myotomy Survey (IPOEMS), 40 percent of POEM procedures were performed in patients with prior endoscopic therapy for achalasia. Although submucosal fibrosis caused by prior botulinum toxin injection or pneumatic dilation may render the dissection more challenging, the general consensus amongst the POEM operators was that the efficacy was not compromised in such patients.</p><p>Recurrent or persistent symptoms can occur in approximately 10 to 20 percent of patients who undergo laparoscopic Heller myotomy. When performed by experienced operators, POEM is a viable rescue option for patients who develop recurrent or persistent symptoms after a Heller myotomy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, 12 patients with recurrent or persistent symptoms 2 to 38 years (mean of 12 years) after a previous Heller myotomy underwent successful POEM procedures. At a mean follow-up of 10.4 months, treatment success was achieved in 11 of 12 patients, with significant reductions in both the Eckardt score (9.2 versus 1.3) and the mean LES pressure (29.4 versus 13.5 mmHg). No serious complications related to POEM occurred. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, 10 patients underwent successful POEM procedures after a failed surgical myotomy. At three months after POEM, both the resting LES pressure (22.1 versus 10.9 mmHg) and the Eckardt score (6.5 versus 1.1) were significantly reduced. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a third study, five patients underwent POEM after a failed laparoscopic Heller myotomy and were able to achieve a significant reduction in their Eckardt scores (6.8 versus 0.6) after 5 months. </p><p/><p>POEM procedures can be repeated in patients who develop recurrent symptoms after a previous POEM procedure, typically on the opposite side of the esophagus. However, no series have reported on the efficacy of repeated POEM procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H189883874\"><span class=\"h2\">Adverse events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When performed by experienced operators, POEM is a safe procedure that is associated with a low rate of postoperative adverse events. Most complications that occur after POEM can be managed expectantly, medically, or endoscopically. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1803113061\"><span class=\"h3\">Pneumoperitoneum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small pneumoperitoneum and subcutaneous emphysema are experienced during 50 and 15 percent of POEM procedures, respectively. They typically resolve spontaneously. Severe or tension pneumoperitoneum is rare but requires prompt detection and decompression when it occurs. &#160;</p><p>The abdomen is palpated periodically throughout the procedure to exclude severe pneumoperitoneum. If the abdomen becomes excessively distended, especially if the tidal volume begins to diminish or the peak and plateau airway pressures begin to rise, abdominal decompression is performed using a Veress needle or an angiocatheter. Prior to decompressing the abdomen, the operator must be sure that the abdominal distention <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respiratory compromise are secondary to excessive abdominal (peritoneal) insufflation, rather than gastric insufflation, by first desufflating the stomach endoscopically. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H943569626\"><span class=\"h3\">Pneumothorax</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumothorax is infrequently encountered (&lt;5 percent of cases) but does not usually require treatment, as carbon dioxide used for insufflation is rapidly absorbed. Chest tube insertion is only required in case of respiratory compromise to allow the procedure to be continued. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2364243743\"><span class=\"h3\">Mucosal tear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inadvertent mucosal tears (mucosotomy) during POEM require prompt closure because they represent full-thickness esophageal perforations after all other layers of the esophageal wall have been divided. Most mucosotomies occur at the level of the LES and cardia where the submucosal tunnel narrows. Small mucosotomies can be closed with endoclips; larger mucosotomies have to be closed with an endoluminal suturing device (eg, OverStitch). Alternatively, mucosotomies can also be closed with fibrin glue or over-the-scope clips. When a mucosotomy is detected during submucosal tunneling, it should be closed immediately or else its size may increase rapidly. </p><p>Mediastinitis from esophageal leak is the most feared complication of POEM but is remarkably rare (&lt;0.1 percent of cases). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1025914639\"><span class=\"h3\">Bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding during submucosal tunneling is not uncommon. The risk of bleeding can be minimized with a careful stepwise dissection to allow for visualization of individual blood vessels. Small vessels can be prophylactically coagulated with the electrocautery knife itself; hemostatic forceps (eg, Coagrasper) should be used to coagulate larger vessels in the gastric cardia. If bleeding appears to originate from a vessel along the mucosal surface, hemostasis can be achieved with gentle pressure applied with the tip of the gastroscope for several minutes, rather than with electrocautery.</p><p>In a large series of 428 patients, delayed bleeding occurred in 0.7 percent of patients. Patients who present with hematemesis after a POEM procedure, with or without chest pain, should undergo emergency endoscopy, during which the clips or sutures used to close the mucosal incision must be removed and the submucosal tunnel and myotomy site inspected for bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2038847943\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastroesophageal reflux</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common late adverse event associated with POEM is gastroesophageal reflux (GER). Based on objective data (endoscopic-proven erosive esophagitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abnormal pH study), the prevalence of GER after POEM varies between 20 and 57 percent, depending on studies. These rates are comparable with those observed after laparoscopic Heller myotomy in some studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194514251\"><span class=\"h1\">POEM FOR DISEASES OTHER THAN ACHALASIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although it was originally developed for achalasia, POEM has been used to treat other upper esophagogastric diseases, such as spastic esophageal disorders and gastroparesis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2771030211\"><span class=\"h2\">POEM for spastic esophageal disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spastic esophageal disorders (SEDs) are characterized by hyperactive esophageal contractions of either abnormal propagation (premature contraction) or extreme vigorous contraction. Examples of SEDs include spastic or type III achalasia, distal esophageal spasm (DES), hypercontractile (jackhammer) esophagus, and hypertensive esophageal peristalsis (nutcracker esophagus). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esophageal-motility-disorders-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Esophageal motility disorders: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Esophageal manometry'</a>.)</p><p>POEM has been used to treat jackhammer esophagus, DES, spastic achalasia, and nutcracker esophagus. As an example, in an international multicenter study, 73 patients underwent POEM for spastic esophageal disorders, including 9 patients with DES, 10 with jackhammer esophagus, and 54 with spastic achalasia. The mean length of the submucosal tunnel was 19 cm, and the mean myotomy length was 16 cm. After an average follow-up of eight months, clinical success was observed in 93 percent of patients. After POEM, the mean Eckardt score decreased from 6.73 to 1.13. All patients who underwent a repeat high-resolution esophageal manometry (60 percent) had resolution of the initial manometric abnormalities. Eight patients experienced adverse events (11 percent), most of which were mild. </p><p>Myotomy of the esophageal body (where hypertensive contractions occur), in addition to the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), may be required to treat SEDs. Surgical myotomy of the upper thoracic esophagus via the transabdominal approach is technically challenging. By contrast, POEM allows access to the entire esophagus, which makes it a potentially more effective treatment for SEDs than surgical myotomy. As an example, in a retrospective study of spastic (type III) achalasia, 49 patients who underwent POEM had a higher clinical response rate than 26 patients who underwent laparoscopic Heller myotomy (98 versus 81 percent). POEM was also associated with a shorter operative time (102 versus 264 minutes), a longer myotomy (16 cm versus 8 cm), and fewer adverse events (6 versus 27 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2571144205\"><span class=\"h2\">POEM for gastroparesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastroparesis is a syndrome of delayed gastric emptying in the absence of a mechanical obstruction, which usually presents with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, early satiety, bloating, or upper abdominal pain. Most cases of gastroparesis are idiopathic, diabetic, or postsurgical. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroparesis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroparesis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Initial management of gastroparesis consists of dietary modification, optimization of glycemic control and hydration, and pharmacologic therapy with prokinetic and antiemetic medications. Patients who are refractory to medical therapy may require surgical interventions in the forms of tube gastrotomy, subtotal gastrectomy, or pyloroplasty. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-gastroparesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of gastroparesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Surgical pyloroplasty (eg, Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty) can lead to sustained improvement of symptoms in patients with refractory gastroparesis. Gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM), which is an endoscopic equivalent of surgical pyloroplasty, has been performed in a few centers for severe refractory diabetic gastroparesis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4209499868\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique of G-POEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The endoscopic pyloromyotomy (G-POEM) procedure myotomizes the pylorus, rather than the lower esophageal sphincter; otherwise, G-POEM consists of the same four steps as described above for POEM (see <a href=\"#H305363267\" class=\"local\">'Operative technique'</a> above). For G-POEM, a submucosal tunnel is typically created 5 cm proximal to the pylorus along the greater curvature or anterior gastric wall. A short (2 cm) antral myotomy is then performed in addition to pyloromyotomy via the submucosal tunnel.</p><p>Postoperative care for G-POEM is the same as for POEM, except that a gastric emptying study is typically performed during follow-up to assess the effect of the myotomy on gastric emptying. (See <a href=\"#H2283908473\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative care'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2789144280\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcomes of G-POEM for gastroparesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several case reports show that G-POEM is safe, feasible, and effective in treating severe refractory gastroparesis. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of seven patients who underwent endoscopic pyloromyotomy for gastroparesis, all procedures were carried out successfully without immediate complications. Six of the seven patients experienced significant symptomatic relief following the procedure, particularly with nausea and epigastric burning. At three months, a gastric emptying study was repeated in five patients with normalization in four. Late complications included one pyloric channel ulcer requiring endoscopic reintervention and one transient dysphagia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study of 30 patients with refractory gastroparesis, G-POEM was completed successfully in all patients. Adverse events occurred in two (6.7 percent) patients, including one pneumoperitoneum and one prepyloric ulcer. Clinical response was observed in 26 (86 percent) patients at a median follow-up of 5.5 months. Repeat gastric emptying scan was obtained in 17 patients, with normalization in 8 (47 percent) and improvement in 6 (35 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4215216597\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a form of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) that utilizes the principles of submucosal endoscopy to perform the endoscopic equivalent of a surgical myotomy. (See <a href=\"#H3908477277\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>POEM can be performed in most patients who have symptomatic, manometrically proven primary idiopathic achalasia. Previous therapies for achalasia, such as pneumatic balloon dilation, botulinum toxin injection, or surgical myotomy, are <strong>not</strong> contraindications to POEM. (See <a href=\"#H3299397391\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have severe erosive esophagitis, significant coagulation disorders, liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension, or prior therapy that may compromise the integrity of the esophageal mucosa or lead to submucosal fibrosis (eg, radiation, endoscopic mucosal resection, radiofrequency ablation) should <strong>not</strong> undergo POEM. (See <a href=\"#H1919903312\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>POEM is typically performed in four consecutive steps: mucosal incision, creation of a submucosal tunnel, myotomy, and closure of mucosal incision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109285\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef109285 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H305363267\" class=\"local\">'Operative technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In our practice, patients are admitted to the hospital for overnight observation and kept nil per os (NPO) after POEM. Esophagram is obtained the following day to exclude an esophageal leak, after which a soft diet is allowed. At discharge, patients are prescribed broad-spectrum antibiotics for approximately three to five days, twice-daily proton pump inhibitors for two weeks, and are advised to remain on a soft diet for 10 to 14 days. (See <a href=\"#H2283908473\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The short-term success rate of POEM for achalasia is 82 to 100 percent, comparable with that of a laparoscopic Heller myotomy. Longer-term studies revealed success rates of 78 to 88 percent at two to three years. POEM also appears to be a viable treatment option for patients who develop recurrent or persistent symptoms after other treatments of achalasia, such as pneumatic dilatation, botulinum toxin injection, or surgical myotomy. (See <a href=\"#H1443112471\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes of POEM for achalasia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adverse events associated with POEM include pneumoperitoneum, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, mucosotomy, bleeding, and gastroesophageal reflux. Most of the adverse events can be managed expectantly, medically, or endoscopically. (See <a href=\"#H189883874\" class=\"local\">'Adverse events'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The POEM technique has been successfully used to treat spastic esophageal disorders (eg, spastic achalasia, distal esophageal spasm, jackhammer esophagus, or nutcracker esophagus) and severe gastroparesis refractory to medical therapy.
