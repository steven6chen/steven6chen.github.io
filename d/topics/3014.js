Within psychiatric nosology, catatonia is not conceptualized as a separate diagnostic entity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Rather, the term catatonia is used to specify a subtype of the underlying disorder, similar to the term &ldquo;psychotic features.&rdquo; (However, some experts view catatonia as a syndrome that warrants a stand-alone diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].) </p><p>Recognizing catatonia is important because it may be caused or exacerbated by treatment of the underlying disorder. As an example, antipsychotic drugs used for bipolar or psychotic disorders may worsen catatonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis of catatonia, as well as the disorders that can progress to catatonia. The treatment and prognosis of catatonia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catatonia: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6713689\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The estimated incidence of catatonia has been studied primarily in acutely ill psychiatric inpatients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The incidence is approximately 10 percent, but estimates range from 5 to 20 percent, based upon prospective studies conducted for one to twelve months at individual psychiatric units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-14</a>]. The range is probably due in part to differences in study methods, including how catatonia was defined. The syndrome may go unrecognized, leading to the false conclusion that it is rare. In a Dutch study of 139 acutely psychotic inpatients, the treatment team diagnosed catatonia nine times less often than the research team (2 versus 18 percent of patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>It is not clear if there are any sociodemographic risk factors for catatonia. Catatonia seems to occur more commonly in patients with unipolar major depression or bipolar disorder, compared with other disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, catatonia may perhaps occur more often in patients with prior episodes. (See <a href=\"#H1662065\" class=\"local\">'Underlying disorders'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2637666813\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6713696\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catatonia occurs in the context of an underlying psychiatric or general medical disorder, and treatments that are used for these underlying disorders may cause or exacerbate catatonia. As an example, antipsychotic drugs used for bipolar or psychotic disorders may worsen catatonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catatonia-treatment-and-prognosis#H13927994\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catatonia: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Avoid dopamine blocking drugs'</a>.)</p><p>The pathophysiology of catatonia is unknown. Neurobiologic correlates of catatonia have been identified, but it is not clear if these findings represent etiologic causes or sequelae of the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Neurobiologic studies have led to a hypothesis that catatonia involves pathways that connect the basal ganglia with the cortex and thalamus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Neuropathologic studies of patients with catatonic schizophrenia have found alterations in the basal ganglia (caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, and pallidum) and thalamus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Neuroimaging studies suggest that catatonia may possibly involve functional alterations in the prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and parietal cortices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. In addition, neuropsychologic tests of remitted catatonic patients found a deficit in visual-spatial abilities that may involve right parietal cortex function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20</a>]. Neurotransmitter studies suggest that catatonia may be associated with decreased activity at gamma-aminobutyric acid A and dopamine D2 receptors, and increased activity at N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21</a>].</p><p>Some patients may possibly have a genetic predisposition to catatonia. Preliminary evidence suggests that genes on chromosomes 15 and 22 may be linked to the periodic form of catatonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>].

The disturbance can range from marked reduction in movements to marked agitation. Starting, stopping, and planning movement can be impaired, and motor behavior may be repetitive, purposeless, impervious to external stimuli, and contrary to intent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Small prospective studies of catatonia and case series have found that catatonia is marked by heterogeneous signs that are observed or elicited (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F53391\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53391 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F66229\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66229 \">table 2</a>); the most common are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,11,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immobility (hypokinesis or akinesis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stupor (decreased alertness and response to stimuli)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Negativism (resistance to all instructions or all attempts to be moved)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Waxy flexibility</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posturing </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive, purposeless motor activity (excitement) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staring</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echophenomena </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Echolalia &ndash; Senseless repetition of another person's utterances</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Echopraxia &ndash; Senseless repetition of another person's movements</p><p/><p>Onset of catatonia can be either acute or insidious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. Following remission, some patients cannot recall their experience during the episode, whereas others describe an awareness of their activity and the inability to communicate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Catatonia occurs in patients who are severely ill with an underlying psychiatric or general medical disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,28</a>] (see <a href=\"#H1662065\" class=\"local\">'Underlying disorders'</a> below).

The behavioral phenotype of catatonia exists on a continuum between retarded and excited subtypes, depending upon the motor disturbance. In addition, the severity of catatonia exists on a continuum between nonmalignant and malignant, depending upon other associated features. The three principal forms of catatonia in order of incidence are retarded, excited, and malignant. While a factor-analytic study of 314 psychotic patients supported separation of retarded and excited catatonia as subtypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], patients can exhibit signs of both subtypes concurrently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Subtypes are not necessarily stable during a catatonic episode, and patients may transition from retarded to excited catatonia or vice versa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].

Postures may be mundane (eg, sitting or standing in the same position for hours) or unusual (eg, head raised above the bed as if on a pillow). Response to voice and noxious stimuli is decreased. Although speech and spontaneous movements are reduced, some patients appear to be alert and aware of the environment. In more severe cases, eating and drinking may cease and stupor and incontinence may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3688700361\"><span class=\"h3\">Excited catatonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excited catatonia is characterized by excessive and purposeless motor activity in both the upper and lower limbs (hyperkinesis), restlessness, stereotypy, impulsivity, frenzy, and combativeness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catatonia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>].

Clinicians may overlook these signs because of the severity of associated psychopathology (eg, psychosis). In addition, common signs of catatonia such as mutism, posturing, and rigidity may be absent; many catatonic patients speak and move about. Thus, patients exhibiting only one apparent catatonic sign should be examined for others.</p><p>For patients with an underlying psychiatric disorder, the motor dysregulation of catatonia can be similar to the underlying psychopathology. As an example, the increased motor activity and impulsivity observed in mania may progress to excited catatonia. Mania uncomplicated by catatonia is marked by goal-directed activity and intact cognition. By contrast, activity in catatonia is often repetitive and not goal-directed. As another example, the psychomotor retardation, anergia, anhedonia, and anorexia observed in major depression may resemble retarded catatonia. The hypokinesis and refusal to eat or drink that characterize severe depression may be catatonic signs, and should prompt an assessment for other catatonic signs. Clinical features that often occur in depression not complicated by catatonia include suicidality, sleep disturbance, and feelings of worthlessness, guilt, helplessness, and hopelessness. In addition, catatonia can be distinguished by additional motor signs, such as posturing, rigidity, and negativism, as well as a positive response to the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> challenge test.
