The ear canal is the part of the ear that leads from the outer ear to the ear drum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55121\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55121 \">figure 1</a>). External otitis can develop as a result of an infection, allergy, or skin problem. &quot;Swimmer's ear&quot; is the name for external otitis that occurs in a person who swims frequently.</p><p>External otitis is different from otitis media (middle ear infections). When a person says that they have an ear infection, they usually mean that they have otitis media. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-infections-otitis-media-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Ear infections (otitis media) in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This article will discuss external otitis that is caused by an infection, as well as ways to prevent future episodes of external otitis. More detailed information is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-otitis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External otitis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTERNAL OTITIS RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors can increase your risk of developing external otitis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cleaning the ear canal removes ear wax. Ear wax serves to protect the ears from water, bacteria, and injury. Excessive cleaning or scratching can injure the skin, potentially leading to infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swimming on a regular basis removes some of the ear wax, allowing water to soften the skin. Bacteria, which normally live in the ear canal, can then enter the skin more easily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing devices that block the ear canals, such as hearing aids, headphones, or ear plugs, can increase the risk of external otitis (if worn frequently) by injuring the skin.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTERNAL OTITIS SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms of external otitis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the outer ear, especially when the ear is pulled or moved</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itchiness of the ear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid or pus leaking from the ear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty hearing clearly</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTERNAL OTITIS DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you think that you or your child could have external otitis, you should see a healthcare provider. Your provider will examine the outside and inside of your ear to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTERNAL OTITIS TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of external otitis aims to reduce pain and eliminate the infection. Most people with external otitis can be treated at home. If your infection is severe or your eardrum is ruptured, you will be referred to an ear-nose-and throat specialist (an otolaryngologist) for an examination and treatment.</p><p>In some cases, your healthcare provider will flush out your ear with water and hydrogen peroxide before you begin treatment; this speeds healing by removing dead skin cells and excess ear wax.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Ear drops</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ear drops are usually prescribed to reduce pain and swelling caused by external otitis. It is important to apply the ear drops correctly so that they reach the ear canal:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lie on your side or tilt your head towards the opposite shoulder.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place the ear drops in the ear canal.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lie on your side for 20 minutes or place a cotton ball in the ear canal for 20 minutes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Finish the entire course of treatment, even if you begin to feel better within a few days.</p><p/><p>You should begin to feel better within 36 to 48 hours of starting treatment. If your pain worsens or does not improve within this time period, call your healthcare provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain medication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have bothersome ear pain, you can take a non-prescription pain medication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoid getting ears wet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During treatment, you should avoid getting the inside of your ears wet. While showering, you can place a cotton ball coated with petroleum jelly in the ear. However, you should not swim for 7 to 10 days after starting treatment. Avoid wearing hearing aids and in-ear headphones until pain improves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">EXTERNAL OTITIS PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The old saying, &quot;Don't put anything smaller than your elbow in your ear&quot; to clean the ear is true. The ear is self-cleaning; fingers, towels, cotton-tipped applicators, and other devices should not be used to clean the inside of the ears.</p><p>If you feel that you need to clean excessive wax from your ears, talk to your healthcare provider first. <span class=\"nowrap\">S/he</span> may want to examine your ears to see if the ear wax is excessive. It is normal to have some ear wax (also called cerumen). If you have an excessive amount of ear wax, talk to your healthcare provider about safe ways to clean your ears. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerumen\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerumen&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If you swim frequently, experts recommend the following tips to reduce the chance of developing external otitis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shake your ears dry after swimming</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blow dry your ears on a low setting, holding the dryer 12 inches away.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use ear drops after swimming to prevent ear infections; these are available at most pharmacies without a prescription.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consider wearing ear plugs made for swimming.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=3998\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
