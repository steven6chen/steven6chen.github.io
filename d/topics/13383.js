Untreated progressive disease can lead to significant symptoms (eg, dyspnea and fatigue) and serious complications (eg, pulmonary edema, systemic embolism, and pulmonary hypertension). The great majority of cases in adults are due to rheumatic heart disease, with symptoms usually appearing 16 to 40 years after the episode of acute rheumatic fever. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-natural-history-of-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and natural history of mitral stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although medical therapy can relieve symptoms, it does not affect the obstruction to flow. As a result, surgical commissurotomy and open valvuloplasty were, for many years, the only methods by which MS could be corrected. However, the development of percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMBV) by Inoue in 1984 and Lock in 1985 for the treatment of selected patients with MS has revolutionized the treatment of this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>The efficacy of PMBV, including comparison with surgery, and the management of patients with MS undergoing PMBV will be reviewed here. Issues directly related to the timing of intervention, and the medical and surgical management of MS are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-and-investigational-approaches-to-management-of-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical and investigational approaches to management of mitral stenosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management and indications for intervention for mitral stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF PMBV</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Rheumatic MS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are selected for percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMBV) on the basis of hemodynamic and echocardiographic criteria. PMBV is generally performed in chronically symptomatic patients, and may also include those who present emergently with cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, or pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Asymptomatic patients who plan on childbearing or major noncardiac surgery may also be candidates for this procedure. Prophylactic valvotomy for the prevention of systemic emboli or atrial fibrillation is not a firmly established criterion.</p><p>When intervention is warranted, the 2014 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> guidelines generally recommended that PMBV is preferred to surgery if the valve morphology is favorable and the patient does not have left atrial thrombus or moderate to severe (3+ to 4+) mitral regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Among asymptomatic patients, the main indication of PMBV was moderate to severe mitral stenosis (MS) (valve area &le;1.5 cm<sup>2</sup>) and evidence of pulmonary hypertension at rest or with exercise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98324\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98324 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98396\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98396 \">table 1</a>). Similar recommendations were made in 2007 the European Society of Cardiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Consensus guidelines have not addressed patient selection for PMBV to palliate symptoms in patients with multiple comorbidities or other conditions that preclude surgical valve replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In these circumstances, PMBV is often performed (in the absence of left atrial thrombus or moderate to severe mitral regurgitation) despite moderate to advanced deformity of the valve that would otherwise be considered suboptimal or inappropriate for the procedure. Factors that may influence the decision to perform PMBV in such patients include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of therapy in the palliative setting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of MS in the patient's clinical condition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Technical constraints</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient's own preference for symptom relief</p><p/><p>In the United States, as many as 10 to 25 percent of patients undergoing PMBV fall into this palliative category.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital MS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PMBV is primarily performed in patients with rheumatic MS. There is little experience with PMBV in congenital MS, where its efficacy is limited in patients with significant stenosis of the subvalvular apparatus and the catheterization procedure is potentially dangerous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/4,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,9</a>]. PMBV should be considered only in selected patients at centers with established experience and skill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Mitral annular calcification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is generally a benign process but may result in mitral regurgitation and more rarely MS. It is commonly seen in the elderly. Annular calcification alone does not result in MS but when calcification extends into the mitral inflow a gradient may be produced. MAC causing MS is not amenable to balloon valvotomy; instead, early feasibility studies have investigated treatment with transcatheter mitral valve replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification#H33010173\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of mitral annular calcification&quot;, section on 'Mitral valve surgery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echocardiography is an essential screening procedure in patients who appear to be candidates for PMBV&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/4,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Valvular anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extent of valvular and subvalvular deformity can be evaluated and the likelihood of a successful result after PMBV can be assessed by the Wilkins score, which is calculated from the sum of grades of 0 to 4 for each of the four factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The degree of leaflet rigidity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The severity of leaflet thickening</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The amount of leaflet calcification</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The extent of subvalvular thickening </p><p/><p>The maximum score is 16; higher scores indicate more severe anatomic disease and a lower likelihood of a successful balloon valvotomy with durability.</p><p>A similar scoring system may help to predict the development of severe mitral regurgitation after valvotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In a series of 117 patients undergoing valvotomy, those who developed severe mitral regurgitation had a significantly higher score compared with those who did not develop this complication (10.5 versus 8.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. When a total score of &ge;10 was used as a cut-off, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for predicting severe mitral regurgitation were 82, 91, 90, and 97 percent, respectively. This finding was reported from a single center and it is not the authors' experience that advanced valve deformity predicts a higher risk of inducing severe mitral regurgitation unless the fused commissures are calcified.</p><p>The echocardiographic score is also related to in-hospital costs. In one report, the mean in-hospital cost was much higher in patients with a score above 8 than in those with lower scores ($21,137 versus $7613) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The cost increased by $2663 for every grade increase in the score.</p><p>Another possibly effective approach for predicting outcome after valvotomy involves echocardiographic examination of the mitral valve commissures, since splitting of fused commissures is the primary mechanism by which PMBV produces a long-term therapeutic impact. Studies have examined the significance of calcification of the commissures as a predictor of procedural outcome:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one report, 149 patients were followed for three years after PMBV. Patients with commissural calcium had a lower survival and a higher incidence of mitral valve replacement (MVR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80604\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80604 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a subsequent review of 300 patients, the extent of commissural calcification was quantified on a scale of 0 to 4 by giving each half of the posteromedial and anterolateral commissure a score of 0 or 1 (maximum score 16) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The commissural calcification grade was a significant predictor of achieving a mitral valve area of &gt;1.5 cm<sup>2</sup> without mitral regurgitation, particularly in patients with an echo score &le;8.</p><p/><p>These findings compare favorably to the predictive value of the echocardiographic scoring system. Thus, commissural calcium is an adjunct to the echocardiographic evaluation of mitral valve morphology.</p><p>A subvalvular apparatus (SVA) score has been proposed that may help predict adverse outcomes, although validation is needed before this score can be recommended for clinical use. In a study from India of 356 patients with rheumatic MS undergoing PMBV in one year, a scale of I to III was used for classifying the degree of SVA disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The SVA score was graded I when neither of the two SVAs had severe disease, II when one of the two SVAs has severe disease, and III when both SVAs had severe disease. The echocardiographic findings were validated with surgical pathology specimens in 39 patients undergoing surgical valve replacement for either failed PMVR or the induction of severe mitral regurgitation. The subvalvular score was more sensitive and specific than the Wilkins score in predicting these adverse outcomes. </p><p>Intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) employs an ultrasound-tipped catheter inserted intravenously and manipulated within the heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60589\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60589 \">figure 3</a>). Although not currently an accepted part of the diagnostic strategy for the evaluation of patients with MS, one preliminary observations study suggests that ICE may detects more extensive subvalvular disease than suggested by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and therefore may improve patient selection for PMBV versus surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73918%7ECARD%2F82552%7ECARD%2F59077\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73918 graphicRef82552 graphicRef59077 \">image 1A-C</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This technique can also be used for monitoring during the valvotomy procedure. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> below.)</p><p>The results of echocardiography can be combined with other factors to improve patient selection. A logistic model was developed in a review of 1514 patients undergoing PMBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Younger patients and those with evidence of less severe disease by echocardiography, estimated valve area, and effective balloon dilating area had a better outcome.</p><p>While echocardiographic scoring systems may be of some benefit in predicting the outcome of PMBV, their practical clinical utility when considered in isolation is limited. The induction of severe mitral regurgitation and other sequelae can occur even in patients with &quot;ideal&quot; valves. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Postprocedural MR'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, PMBV is often performed with an expectation that as many as 25 to 35 percent of patients may not have an event-free five-year survival. Finally, in patients who are not surgical candidates, palliative PMBV may be necessary even in the face of poor echocardiographic scores.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Left atrial thrombus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of left atrial or left atrial appendage thrombus is a contraindication to PMBV because of the risk of dislodging the thrombus during the procedure. Such thrombi are not uncommon in patients with MS. The prevalence appears to be related in part to whether or not the patients have been treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>. Thus, in two series of patients referred for PMBV, the prevalence of left atrial thrombus was 13 percent in a study from Scotland in which almost all patients had been treated with warfarin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] compared with 32 percent in a report from Thailand, which excluded patients who had been treated with warfarin more than 72 hours before study entry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>We agree with the 2014 <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ACC</span> valvular disease guideline and the 2008 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guideline recommendation to perform preprocedural TEE to exclude left atrial thrombus in patients being considered for PMBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/4,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,24</a>]. If the preprocedural TEE reveals left atrial thrombus, we recommend postponement of the procedure and administration of anticoagulant therapy (target International Normalized Ratio [INR] 3.0, range 2.5 to 3.5) until thrombus resolution is documented by repeat TEE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. If left atrial thrombus does not resolve with anticoagulant therapy, we recommend that PMBV not be performed if surgery is feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>TEE is much more sensitive than TTE for the detection of left atrial thrombus. This difference was illustrated in a series of 474 patients undergoing mitral valve surgery in which the sensitivity and specificity of TTE were 32 and 94 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In contrast, the sensitivity and specificity of TEE for left atrial appendage thrombi were 98 and 98 percent, and for left atrial cavity thrombi 81 and 99 percent. As a result, TEE is recommended prior to PMBV&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/4,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiography-in-detection-of-cardiac-and-aortic-sources-of-systemic-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiography in detection of cardiac and aortic sources of systemic embolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients in whom left atrial thrombus is seen on TEE may be treated with six months of anticoagulation followed by repeat TEE to evaluate for resolution of thrombus. The frequency with which this occurs was assessed in a report of 219 patients from Thailand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Oral anticoagulation was initiated to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0. At six months, thrombus was no longer detectable in 53 patients (24 percent). Variables predicting thrombus resolution included better New York Heart Association functional class (I or II), thrombus size &le;1.6 cm<sup>2</sup> and confined to the left atrial appendage, less marked left atrial spontaneous echocardiographic contrast, and maintenance of a mean INR &ge;2.5. Patients with all of these predictors had a 94 percent incidence of complete thrombus resolution.</p><p>In a study from India of 66 patients with MS and left atrial thrombus, oral anticoagulation was given for up to six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Complete resolution of thrombus was seen on TEE in 22 patients (33 percent) and organization in 38 (58 percent); only six patients (9 percent) had no change in thrombus appearance.</p><p>Some patients with left atrial appendage thrombus found on TEE immediately prior to planned PMBV are too symptomatic to wait six months. In such patients, a shorter duration of anticoagulation may be tried prior to repeat TEE. Surgical mitral valve repair or replacement with left atrial appendage ligation may need to be considered in patients unable to tolerate an adequate duration of anticoagulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonpharmacologic-therapy-to-prevent-embolization-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation#H1136760403\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonpharmacologic therapy to prevent embolization in patients with atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Patients undergoing cardiac surgery'</a>.)</p><p>While improved imaging during PMBV, as with real-time 3D TEE, may enable more careful catheter manipulation in the left atrium, it remains impossible to guarantee that the catheter tip will not end up unintentionally in the left atrial appendage (LAA) during some part of the procedure. Given the devastating nature of an embolic stroke from a LAA thrombus, it is hard to justify the potential risk of PMBV in the presence of thrombus when an alternative approach is possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During cardiac catheterization, a transseptal puncture is used to gain access to the mitral valve from the left atrium. A single deflated balloon or a double-balloon is advanced from the venous circulation to the right atrium, across the interatrial septum to the left atrium, and across the stenotic mitral valve. Inflation and rapid deflation of the balloon opens the stenotic valve via separation of the fused commissures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75997\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef75997 \">movie 1</a>). This mechanism is similar to that of surgical commissurotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Fracture of calcific deposits in the leaflet tissue may also contribute to improved leaflet mobility and leaflet separation.</p><p>In addition to direct measurement of the transmitral pressure gradient, the standard approach to monitoring percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMBV) is transthoracic echocardiography with measurement of mitral valve area and assessment of mitral regurgitant severity after each balloon dilation. The procedure is stopped when an adequate valve area has been achieved or if there is a significant increase in mitral regurgitant severity.</p><p>Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can be performed during PMBV to guide the procedure and monitor for complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/13,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,29</a>]. However, TEE has the disadvantage that general anesthesia may be required due to the length of the procedure. Most centers use transthoracic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intracardiac echocardiography.</p><p>Intracardiac echocardiography can delineate the extent of valvular deformity (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Valvular anatomy'</a> above) and may also be useful in visualizing several key steps of the valvotomy procedure, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transseptal puncture of the interatrial septum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73452\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73452 \">image 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exclusion of thrombus from the left atrial appendage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimizing balloon placement across the valve orifice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53943\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53943 \">image 3</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial assessment of the results of dilatation</p><p/><p>Disadvantages of this approach are increased cost and, with current transducers, an inability to accurately measure mitral valve area or adequately assess mitral regurgitation.</p><p>It has been suggested that three-dimensional echocardiographic reconstruction from the TEE study may be of value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Real-time 3D TEE became commercially available in 2007 and is being used in some centers to guide PMBV. This enables improved visualization of catheter manipulations, a more comprehensive assessment of the mitral valve before and after PMBV, and a more visually intuitive guidance but improved outcomes from a 3D approach have not yet been reported. 3D TEE may identify commissural splitting and leaflet tears that are not visible on a two-dimensional study. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=three-dimensional-echocardiography#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Three-dimensional echocardiography&quot;, section on 'Mitral valve'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Short-term</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The early (immediate) results of percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMBV) are excellent. Most investigators report that the valve area increases from a critically stenotic value of 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup> to approximately 2.0 cm<sup>2</sup>, a change that is associated with a rapid reduction in left atrial pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64660\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64660 \">figure 4</a>). This is smaller than the normal valve area of 3 to 5 cm<sup>2</sup>, but it is sufficient to produce substantial hemodynamic improvements including a decrease in left atrial pressure and the transmitral pressure gradient, a reduction in pulmonary artery pressure, and an increase in cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. An additional benefit is a reduction in left atrial stiffness, resulting in an increase in left atrial pump function in patients in sinus rhythm and an increase in left atrial reservoir function in those with atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Twelve months after valvotomy, several hemodynamic parameters show continued improvement, including further reductions in pulmonary artery systolic pressure and increases in cardiac output. Pulmonary vascular resistance declines and normalizes in many patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

The precision of outcome prediction is somewhat limited with PMBV, thereby introducing greater uncertainty than in many other medical conditions. As a result, careful preprocedure consultation with an open discussion with the patient and family is especially important.</p><p>It is also important to recognize that, particularly in young patients, eventual surgical valve replacement is likely to be necessary in the long term, even for very successful percutaneous procedures. Nevertheless, the benefit of postponing surgery for as long as a decade or more can be significant, depending upon the individual patient.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/percutaneous-mitral-balloon-valvotomy-for-mitral-stenosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Carroll JD, Feldman T.
