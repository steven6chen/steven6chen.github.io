The only effective long-term treatment is ending further lead exposure by eradication of environmental lead contamination. Because the cognitive and behavioral effects of lead toxicity are <strong>not</strong> reversible, primary prevention of lead exposures is the single most important strategy in the management of childhood lead poisoning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Childhood lead poisoning: Exposure and prevention&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>However, children at risk because of lead in their environment are often <strong>not</strong> found until the lead exposure is diagnosed through elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) during screening. At this point, secondary prevention of further lead exposure becomes the main treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56262\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56262 \">table 1</a>). Unfortunately, by the time a child is found with an elevated BLL, the neurodevelopmental harm from the exposure may have already occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Chelation therapy may be necessary depending upon the degree of blood lead elevation (see <a href=\"#H2480949460\" class=\"local\">'Lead level 45 to 69 mcg/dL'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic lead poisoning'</a> below). However, it has limited efficacy. With chronic ingestion or inhalation, lead can be incorporated into the skeletal system and become an endogenous reservoir of lead exposure that is resistant to elimination. While chelating agents can bind to lead in blood, they are ineffective in removing lead from the deep bone stores.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1099860\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because there is no known safe threshold for lead exposure, certain actions should be taken in <strong>all</strong> children with BLLs greater than the United States reference value (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> [0.24 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> in 2012); the timing, urgency, and setting of the interventions vary, depending upon the severity of lead toxicity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F107472\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107472 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>] (see <a href=\"#H3922967509\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic lead exposure and poisoning'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic lead poisoning'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient assessment</strong> &ndash; The clinician should perform a complete history and physical examination that focus on identifying the source of lead exposure, symptoms of lead toxicity, and additional persons at risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=childhood-lead-poisoning-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Childhood lead poisoning: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Childhood lead poisoning: Exposure and prevention&quot;, section on 'Exposure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">During this assessment, clinicians should take a careful history to identify potential non-traditional sources of lead exposure (eg, cosmetics, ethnic products, and jewelry) and strongly encourage repeat investigations to assess for these sources if the original home inspection is negative.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Children with lead poisoning are at risk for developmental delay and may be eligible to receive Early Intervention Services. Appropriate referrals should be made as indicated. Developmental surveillance should continue throughout childhood, particularly at critical transition points (eg, first, fourth, and <span class=\"nowrap\">sixth/seventh</span> grades) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-behavioral-surveillance-and-screening-in-primary-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental-behavioral surveillance and screening in primary care&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Investigation for iron deficiency</strong> &ndash; Laboratory screening to determine the presence of concurrent iron deficiency is appropriate in all children with detectable or elevated BLLs (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iron deficiency in infants and children &lt;12 years: Screening, prevention, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Evaluation for suspected IDA'</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Complete blood count</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Serum ferritin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>C-reactive protein</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Additional iron studies are suggested in children undergoing chelation.

Fasting should be <strong>avoided</strong> because it increases intestinal lead absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Calcium and vitamin C</strong> &ndash; In most patients, two daily servings of dairy or other calcium-rich foods and two servings of fruit or fruit juice provide sufficient calcium and vitamin C in the diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Supplementation of these nutrients is typically <strong>not</strong> necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Iron intake and supplementation</strong> &ndash; Adequate iron intake is important in all children because iron deficiency causes neurocognitive deficits whether or not lead toxicity is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H20317248\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iron deficiency in infants and children &lt;12 years: Screening, prevention, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations of IDA'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Iron supplementation should <strong>not</strong> occur during chelation therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">However, the role of iron supplementation in children with lead poisoning who are not receiving chelation is unclear. Like calcium, dietary iron is thought to decrease the intestinal absorption of lead. This theory is supported by epidemiologic studies that demonstrate an increased prevalence of iron deficiency among children with lead poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-management/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. However, the association is not present consistently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Iron supplementation in children with iron deficiency and lead poisoning improves developmental assessment scores independent of BLL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-management/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Evidence for such an effect in iron-replete children is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-management/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Until further data clarify the effect of iron supplementation on lead excretion and the benefit of iron supplementation in iron-replete children with lead toxicity, the decision regarding iron supplementation should be individualized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Because elevated lead levels may cause constipation and decreased elimination, a diet with adequate fiber should be encouraged to ensure proper evacuation of the bowel and enable rapid clearing of any lead before it can be absorbed. Fresh fruits and vegetables are the easiest way to provide adequate fiber.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lead education for the family</strong> &ndash; The family requires education concerning the sources of lead exposure, prevention of exposure, and ways to decrease intestinal absorption of lead (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63418\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63418 \">table 3</a>). Likewise, the healthcare provider should inform parents that any abatement work must be performed by a contractor licensed to do lead abatement if such licensing is performed in the jurisdiction. Families should <strong>not</strong> attempt abatement themselves for fear that they could make the environment more dangerous. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Childhood lead poisoning: Exposure and prevention&quot;, section on 'Education and dust control'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Childhood lead poisoning: Exposure and prevention&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Testing of other children at risk </strong>&ndash; Siblings and other children who live in the household or attend the same school or day care that has been identified as a source of lead exposure should be tested for lead poisoning by their primary care providers. Venous blood testing is recommended. Regional public health personnel, regional poison control centers, and, if available, Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units can assist with interpreting test results and recommending further measures. (See <a href=\"#H1115408214\" class=\"local\">'Additional resources'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Notification of appropriate public health authority</strong> &ndash; Public health department notification often requires that the clinician make a mandated report to a regional health department (eg, city, county, state, or province), depending upon the jurisdiction. Central reporting of lead toxicity helps to identify new risk categories for exposure. Ideally, the health department can arrange for inspection of the home and other environments where the child spends time so that remediation can begin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lead abatement</strong> &ndash; Many government health departments no longer have funding for lead inspection services. Limited funding has resulted in the inability to identify the lead source for some affected patients. The health care provider should still work with the public health departments to find qualified home inspectors and lead abatement contractors in the region. If a home assessment can be completed, the BLL that triggers a home inspection varies with the jurisdiction, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that the home inspection and lead hazard reduction (abatement) occur for all children with levels above the reference level of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (0.24 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> with anticipatory guidance, at minimum, for children with any detectable BLLs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-management/abstract/5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15</a>]. Given the decrease in the lead reference level and the recognition that there is no safe lead level, the BLL that triggers specific environmental action may be lower in some jurisdictions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=childhood-lead-poisoning-exposure-and-prevention#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Childhood lead poisoning: Exposure and prevention&quot;, section on 'Resources'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Follow-up lead testing</strong> &ndash; The child and siblings should have follow-up lead levels. The schedule for these tests varies depending upon the original level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F107472\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107472 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3922967509\"><span class=\"h1\">ASYMPTOMATIC LEAD EXPOSURE AND POISONING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Categories of lead poisoning have been defined, previously, by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, given that there is no safe blood lead level (BLL), all children with a detectable lead level warrant education and an environmental investigation. (See <a href=\"#H1099860\" class=\"local\">'Approach'</a> above.) </p><p>As levels increase, hospitalization and chelation may also be necessary depending upon symptoms, chronicity of lead exposure, and whether or not lead-safe housing for the child can be assured. When lead-safe housing cannot be assured, hospitalization will remove the child from the lead source and is a key component of successful treatment.</p><p>When screening for lead poisoning, venous samples are preferred because they more accurately represent the child's current exposure to lead. Nevertheless, capillary samples are frequently obtained because of the convenience and immediate results provided by point-of-care testing. Because environmental lead contamination on the skin can lead to falsely elevated lead levels in capillary samples, they require confirmation of positive results using venous blood testing. However, capillary samples do serve as an indicator of lead in the environment. Thus, even if a venous sample does not confirm an elevated BLL, the elevated capillary level indicates that education should be provided. Hair and urine samples should <strong>not</strong> be used for diagnosis of lead poisoning.

However, any detectable lead &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (0.24 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> warrants careful evaluation and an attempt at determining the source of lead exposure. &#160;</p><p>This approach to detectable BLLs recognizes that there is no safe lead level.

Furthermore, even if chelation is provided, the primary treatment remains removal of the child from further lead exposure.</p><p>As an example, in a blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 780 children (aged 12 to 33 months) with BLLs of 20 to 44 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (0.96 to 2.13 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> that compared up to three courses of succimer and lead abatement to lead abatement alone, mean BLL in the treatment group was 4.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (95% CI, 3.7-5.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL)</span> lower than in the control group during the first six months of the trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

As an example, a single course of oral chelation with succimer in 1156 Nigerian children, including 36 percent of patients with venous BLLs &ge;80 <span class=\"nowrap\">ug/dL,</span> was associated with an absolute mean decrease in blood lead level of 29.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ug/dL</span> for the initial course delivered, and a mean decrease in blood lead level of 22.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">ug/dL</span> per course across all courses administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/childhood-lead-poisoning-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Minimal adverse effects, primarily moderate serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations occurred in &lt;2.5 percent of 3180 treatment courses. Inpatient administration, higher pre-treatment lead levels, and 28-day treatment courses were associated with better responses. Mortality for all children (including those without severe lead poisoning) was 2 percent during the period of the study. Thus, treatment with succimer for severe lead poisoning may be an option if dimercaprol and CaNa<sub>2</sub>EDTA are not available or cannot be safely administered.
