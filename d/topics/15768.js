The most commonly performed biopsy procedures are reviewed here. Biopsy of the nail apparatus is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nail-biopsy-indications-and-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nail biopsy: Indications and techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More errors are made from failing to biopsy promptly than from performing unnecessary biopsies. Nevertheless, many dermatoses have nonspecific histopathology, and biopsy cannot substitute for good clinical skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Biopsy is indicated in the following circumstances (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67185\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67185 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All suspected neoplastic lesions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All bullous disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To clarify a diagnosis when a limited number of entities are under consideration</p><p/><p>Biopsy can also serve as the definitive treatment for irritated, inflamed, precancerous, or malignant lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/2,4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-6</a>]. However, for malignant lesions, a pathologic report indicating that the biopsy margins are &quot;clear&quot; does not necessarily mean that there has been adequate therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial surgical management of melanoma of the skin and unusual sites&quot;, section on 'Initial biopsy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-basal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features of basal cell carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma-scc\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few absolute contraindications to skin biopsy. It usually should not be performed at an infected site, although occasionally infection is the indication for the procedure. Patients should be asked about allergies to topical antibiotics, antiseptics, local anesthetics, and reactions to tape.</p><p>Inquiries also should be made regarding bleeding disorders, bleeding with previous surgery, and use of drugs known to interfere with hemostasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-assessment-of-hemostasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative assessment of hemostasis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Excessive bleeding is rarely a problem in patients taking oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. Patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> can generally be managed with careful attention to hemostasis and the use of a pressure dressing (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Hemostasis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below). We suggest that patients on oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents be referred to a dermatologist or surgeon for biopsies. These medications should generally not be discontinued for simple skin biopsies. We also suggest referral to a dermatologist or surgeon for biopsies in patients with bleeding disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-surgery-prevention-and-treatment-of-complications#H1268040366\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin surgery: Prevention and treatment of complications&quot;, section on 'Perioperative anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SITE SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Site selection can be critical to diagnosis. The appropriate biopsy site depends upon the type of lesion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For inflammatory lesions, those with characteristic inflammatory changes (eg, erythema) should be biopsied first; evolutionary changes may take time so biopsies performed too early and very late lesions may reveal only nonspecific or secondary features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/2-4,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,7-9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For blistering diseases, early evolving lesions have more specific histopathology and are preferred for biopsy. Only the newest vesicles and blisters should be biopsied, ideally within 48 hours of their appearance. Older lesions with secondary changes such as crusts, fissures, erosions, excoriations, and ulcerations should be avoided since the primary pathologic process may be obscured. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-cutaneous-blisters#H4714350\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with cutaneous blisters&quot;, section on 'Skin biopsy'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The location of biopsy within a particular lesion also depends upon the type and size of the lesions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For nonbullous lesions, the biopsy should include maximal lesional skin and minimal normal skin. For lesions between 1 and 4 mm in diameter, biopsy the center or excise the entire lesion. For large lesions, biopsy the edge, the thickest portion, or the area that is most abnormal in color; these sites will most likely contain the distinctive pathology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove vesicles intact when possible, with adjacent normal appearing skin; disruption makes histologic interpretation more difficult.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bullae should be biopsied at the edge to include a small part of the blister with adjacent intact skin, keeping the blister roof attached. This technique is important for diagnosis; it allows the pathologist to determine the level of blister formation within the skin (eg, subcorneal, intraepidermal, subepidermal). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-cutaneous-blisters#H4714350\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with cutaneous blisters&quot;, section on 'Skin biopsy'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Several sites should be biopsied if the differential diagnosis is broad to minimize sampling error.</p><p>Important cosmetic areas such as the face and areas with poor healing characteristics (distal lower extremities) should be avoided if possible when choosing a biopsy site for a generalized process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/4,8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,10</a>]. When there are individual suspicious lesions involving the face or other cosmetically important areas, it may be preferable to refer the patient to a dermatologist or plastic surgeon who has expertise in such biopsies.</p><p>All biopsies leave scars. Hypertrophic scarring tends to occur over the deltoid and chest areas; delayed healing can be a problem over the tibia, especially in patients with diabetes or in patients with arterial or venous insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The incidence of secondary infection in the groin and axillae is high; biopsy these areas only if other sites are unavailable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOPSY TECHNIQUES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">General measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shave and punch biopsies are clean, not sterile procedures; mask, gown, and sterile gloves are not necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]. Mask, gown, and sterile gloves are indicated for excisions and are reasonable for any patient at increased risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A list of the supplies and instruments necessary is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58432\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58432 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16795393\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy site identification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to identify the biopsy site before performing the definitive surgical treatment to avoid wrong-site surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Several methods have been used for the identification of the biopsy site, including reporting in medical records the accurate description of the lesion and surrounding anatomic landmarks <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> measurements from at least two fixed landmarks, marking the site with tattoo ink, and taking a photograph of the biopsy site. There is consensus among experts that taking a high-quality photograph of the lesion that includes one or more visible anatomic landmarks at the time of biopsy provides a quick and unequivocal documentation of the biopsy site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Preparing the site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any common skin antiseptic such as isopropyl alcohol, povidone-iodine, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> gluconate can be used to prepare the biopsy site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/3,5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,7</a>]. Mark the intended lesion with a surgical marker since it may be temporarily obliterated following injection of the anesthetic. Marking the outlines for excisional biopsies also can be helpful. For excisions, place a fenestrated surgical drape over the biopsy site after the area is cleansed and anesthetized.</p><p>Round wounds tend to be pulled open in the direction of skin tension lines (known as Langer's lines) that generally parallel the direction of collagen in the dermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/10,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,15</a>]. Tension lines can be demonstrated by gently compressing relaxed skin with the thumb and index finger; wrinkle lines on the face are another good indicator. Surgical incisions placed parallel to tension lines will close more easily and cosmetically than those placed at right angles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79204\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79204 \">picture 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/6,10,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most commonly used local anesthetic is 1 or 2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>. Small amounts of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> are added to constrict blood vessels, decrease bleeding, prolong anesthesia, and limit lidocaine toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/5,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16</a>]. The onset of vasoconstriction is about 10 minutes slower than that of anesthesia.</p><p>Given the vasoconstrictive properties of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, concern has been raised regarding the possibility of epinephrine-induced ischemic necrosis in areas such as the digits, ears, and nose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/6,10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,16</a>]. However, the results of some studies suggest that with proper technique, local infiltrative anesthesia with dilute solutions of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> with epinephrine may be safe for use in these areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>].</p><p>The following can minimize the sting of injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/3,5,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mix 1 mL of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/mL</span> with 9 mL of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a 30-gauge needle.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make the initial injection perpendicular (or near perpendicular) to the skin.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep injections sting less than superficial injections but prolong the time to adequate anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small syringes (1 and 3 cc) permit easier injections and are less cumbersome to handle.</p><p/><p>The anesthetic can be injected directly into or immediately adjacent to small lesions. The anesthetic must be infiltrated into the dermis if it is being used to elevate a lesion for biopsy. A field block should be performed for larger lesions by placing a ring of anesthetic around the surgical site, advancing and injecting through a site that has been previously anesthetized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/14,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous infiltration of local anesthetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shave biopsies are quick, require little training, and do not require sutures for closure; a small depressed scar about the size of the initial lesion is likely to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Lesions that are most suitable for shave biopsies are either elevated above the skin or have pathology confined to the epidermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/5,7,14,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,14,22</a>]. Examples include seborrheic or actinic keratoses, skin tags, warts, and superficial basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas. Superficial shave biopsies should not be used for pigmented lesions; an unsuspected melanoma cannot be properly staged if partially removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/4,5,7,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Pigmented lesions'</a> below.)</p><p>Punch biopsies are performed with round, disposable knives ranging in diameter from 2 to 10 mm; 3 mm is the smallest size likely to give sufficient tissue for consistently accurate histologic diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The punch is an ideal procedure for diagnostic skin biopsy or removing small lesions. It often provides a better cosmetic result than a shave biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/3,7,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,22</a>]. Punch biopsies are easily mastered by most practitioners, are quick, and have a low incidence of infection, bleeding, nonhealing, or significant scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/3,7,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,22</a>]. They can heal by secondary intention, but punches greater than 3 mm may produce unacceptable scarring and are best closed with one or two sutures.</p><p>Excisions are performed for lesions that require complete removal for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes and for lesions that cannot be adequately biopsied with a punch due to size, depth, or location. An excisional biopsy allows for histopathologic examination of an entire lesion. Another advantage of an excisional biopsy is the amount of tissue that can be excised, allowing for multiple studies (culture, histopathology, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy) from one biopsy site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. Excisions are especially well suited for removal of large skin tumors or inflammatory disorders deep in the skin involving the panniculus.</p><p>Excisions require the greatest amount of expertise and time; they almost always require sutures, and are more easily performed with an assistant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. We recommend that practitioners receive clinical training before attempting an excisional biopsy, or refer patients requiring an excision to a qualified dermatologist or surgeon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Shave biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shave biopsies can be either superficial or deep. Superficial shave biopsies are done across or nearly parallel to the skin surface and extend into the epidermis only or epidermis and limited superficial dermis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70126\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70126 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The shave biopsy can be facilitated by raising the lesion with a wheal of injected anesthetic, allowing the lesion to be propped up and stabilized between the thumb and forefinger (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82624\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82624 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/6,10,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,22</a>].</p><p>When performing a superficial shave biopsy, a number 15 blade on a scalpel is held tangential to the skin surface. The lesion is then removed with a forward smooth sweeping stroke of the blade going just under and across the lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82624\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82624 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The slightly deeper shave biopsy allows for sampling of dermis and epidermis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F70126\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70126 \">figure 1</a>), important for assessing basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas (superficial shave biopsies of exophytic tumors may only contain epidermal tissue, preventing histologic differentiation between in-situ and invasive malignancy). For this biopsy, the clinician holds the scalpel like a pencil, makes a small vertical incision into the skin with the beveled tip of the number 15 scalpel blade, then turns the scalpel and moves the blade forward in a horizontal sawing motion, turning the blade up towards the surface to finish the excision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The defect created is that of a saucer (hence the alternative name &quot;saucerization&quot; biopsy).</p><p>In both biopsies, the index finger can be placed on top of the lesion near the end of the excision to stabilize and prevent tearing. Since the angle of the blade controls the depth of the biopsy, attention should be paid to the angle entering and exiting the skin.</p><p>A double-edge razor blade cut longitudinally also can be used for shave biopsies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57311\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57311 \">picture 2</a>). The razor technique has several advantages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is sharper than most surgical blades.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The razor can be bent concave or convex with the thumb and forefinger to better conform to the surface being cut.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depth is easily controlled by increasing or decreasing the convexity of the curve.</p><p/><p>Devices are available that provide a holder or handle for the razor blade and many clinicians find these helpful.</p><p>Curved scissors are an efficient means of removing skin tags and other small exophytic growths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The lesion to be removed is stabilized with toothed forceps, then cut at the base.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemostasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding following small shave biopsies can often be controlled with pressure alone. Persistent oozing may be stopped with 10 to 20% aluminum chloride in absolute alcohol (eg,&nbsp;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aluminum-chloride-hexahydrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aluminum chloride hexahydrate</a>). Other hemostatic agents, in order of increasing corrosiveness, are Monsel's solution (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-subsulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric subsulfate</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichloroacetic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trichloroacetic acid</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver nitrate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Monsel's solution is more effective than aluminum chloride, but also causes more tissue destruction and, like silver nitrate, can result in skin pigmentation (permanent tattoos).</p><p>The wound must be as dry as possible for hemostatic agents to be effective. The agent is applied with a cotton applicator using firm pressure with a twisting motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Excellent hemostasis generally can be achieved in patients with bleeding disorders or in those taking oral anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents with the combined use of aluminum chloride and several minutes of direct pressure over the wound.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Punch biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Punch biopsies are relatively simple and the specimen is a cone shaped core of tissue with its widest diameter at the skin surface and narrowest at the biopsy base. The direction of the skin tension lines at the biopsy site should be determined prior to performing a punch biopsy. Raise an intradermal welt (wheal) with the anesthetic and select the appropriate size punch. Stabilize the skin with the thumb and forefinger, stretching it slightly perpendicular to the normal skin tension lines; this will produce an oval rather than round wound, facilitating closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Place the punch perpendicular to the skin and apply firm and constant downward pressure with a circular twisting motion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F65739\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65739 \">picture 3</a>). Avoid removing the punch to &quot;check the progress;&quot; this may result in a ragged wound and a shredded biopsy sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/14,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,22</a>].</p><p>A definite &quot;give&quot; occurs when the punch reaches the subcutaneous fat, indicating that a full-thickness cut has been made. Remove the punch and apply downward finger pressure at the sides of the wound to pop up the core. Completely elevate the core with gentle use of forceps or a needle tip and excise it at its base with small tissue scissors. Apply pressure to the wound with gauze in preparation for closure.</p><p>Punch biopsies of the scalp for diagnosis of hair disorders are best accomplished using a 4 mm punch and holding it at 20&deg; to the surface of the scalp, roughly along the axis of the hair follicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/7,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,26</a>]. Biopsies of scalp lesions suspected of being malignant are performed in the same manner as other punch biopsies, with the punch perpendicular to the skin surface. Scalp biopsies bleed profusely and usually require the presence of an assistant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Punch biopsies can be closed with one or two sutures or allowed to heal by secondary intention. A randomized trial in volunteers found that the results with secondary intention healing after 4 mm punch biopsies were at least as good as with suturing, but that patients preferred the appearance of 8 mm punch biopsies that were sutured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Wounds that are allowed to heal by secondary intention may be treated with a hemostatic agent such as aluminum chloride or absorbable gelatin; do not apply a hemostatic agent if sutures are to be used. Contraindications to suturing include biopsies in infected or poorly healing skin; these wounds heal better by secondary intention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Excision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The direction of the skin tension lines should be determined after performing a field block in preparation for an excision. Align the long axis of the excision parallel to the skin tension lines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79204\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79204 \">picture 1</a>). Using a surgical marking pen, draw an ellipse around the lesion to be excised, including a 2 to 5 mm margin of normal skin around the lesion, with 30&deg; angles at each apex, and the length three times the width (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F96128\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96128 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Holding the scalpel with a number 15 blade like a pencil, begin the incision at one apex with the blade perpendicular to the skin. As the incision progresses, use more of the belly of the blade, raising it to the perpendicular again at the next apex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fusiform-elliptical-excision\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fusiform/elliptical excision&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The blade should be angled away from the lesion, slightly undermining the wound edge. This will allow for easier eversion of the wound edge during closure, improving the cosmetic result and decreasing the risk of dehiscence. Avoid crosshatching the incisions at the apices and nicking the sample. It is not necessary to go through the entire thickness of dermis on the first stroke, although ultimately the incision must extend completely through the dermis and be deep enough to see subcutaneous fat when the sample is removed.</p><p>Carefully lift the sample edge with fine forceps once the ellipse has been incised and completely undermine the sample at the level of the subcutaneous fat with scalpel or scissors. Do not remove more tissue at the center than at the apices. Apply pressure to the wound with gauze in preparation for closing.</p><p>It may be technically easier to perform a diamond-shaped excision for small lesions and a hexagonal-shaped excision for larger lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. For diamond excisions, the blade is inserted vertically into the skin to make the four straight-line incisions of the diamond. For the hexagon, two straight, parallel lines are incised on either side of the lesion and then connected at each end by two more straight incisions to form the hexagon.</p><p>The edges of the wound may need to be undermined prior to closing excisional wounds, either sharply with a scalpel or bluntly with scissors. Blunt dissection is performed by advancing the closed scissors under the wound edge at the dermal-subcutaneous junction, and quickly spreading them open. The width of undermining varies with the size of the wound; for most wounds 5 to 10 mm is sufficient. Undermining allows the skin edges to evert more easily and reduces tension on the sutures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/3,6,7,14,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,7,14,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Pigmented lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possibility of malignant melanoma must always be considered when removing pigmented lesions. The preferred biopsy technique for all pigmented lesions and lesions suspicious for or suggestive of melanoma is the excisional biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Excision'</a> above.)</p><p>Small lesions (less than 4 mm in diameter) can be biopsied using punch technique, provided that the entire lesion is removed with the punch. Larger lesions should be biopsied by elliptical excision whenever possible. When not possible or practical, a deep shave that extends well down into the reticular dermis may be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Ideally, the initial specimen should be removed to the level of subcutaneous fat to allow for proper staging if it is a melanoma. Such a shave procedure should generally only be performed by a clinician with experience in the technique; referral to an experienced dermatologist or surgeon is preferred.</p><p>Partial punch biopsies of lesions suspicious for melanoma generally are not recommended. Partial punch biopsies have a higher potential for misdiagnosis than other techniques and are less likely to provide accurate information for histologic staging of melanoma, which is important for management and prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/23,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,29</a>]. Due to the possibility of sampling errors, close follow-up is warranted for lesions that are determined to be benign after a partial biopsy. Thus, lesions that appear too large for ease of biopsy by a primary care clinician should be referred to a dermatologist or surgeon. It is preferable to have the entire lesion removed at time of biopsy, for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Pigmented lesions should never be destroyed by cryosurgery or cautery and all biopsy specimens should be submitted for histopathologic examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Processing the biopsy sample</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The specimen should be placed in a 10 percent buffered formalin solution for evaluation by light microscopy; each specimen is placed into a separate bottle and identified. Special studies require special handling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68516\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68516 \">table 3</a>). Specimens less than 1 cm in greatest dimension can be adequately fixed in 30 mL of formalin; larger specimens require more formalin and should be sectioned to ensure adequate fixation. The pathologist should be informed if the specimen is sectioned and advised of the orientation of the lesion by sectioning through its center and marking the normal skin borders with a surgical marker.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16795454\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology requisition information</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since many dermatologic diagnoses are predicated upon clinicopathologic correlation, the skin biopsy requisition form should include adequate information regarding the patient and the lesion or process biopsied, including the patient's demographics and relevant medical history, clinical appearance, size, and location of the lesion, clinical course, and previous treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Suturing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary closure of a punch wound can be accomplished with one or two, single-layer, interrupted sutures. Some punch wounds can be allowed to heal by secondary intention. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Punch biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p>Excisions can be closed in one or two layers; two-layer closures yield better cosmetic results for larger wounds.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of suture and needle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The qualities most important in suture are flexibility, strength, secure knotting, and infection potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The two major categories of suture are absorbable and nonabsorbable. Absorbable suture is made from synthetic polymer or mammalian-derived collagen (gut). Common synthetic absorbables include polyglactic acid (Vicryl), polyglycolic acid, and polydioxanone (PDS). Absorbable sutures are usually placed deep in larger wounds to reduce skin tension for the final closure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Closure of minor skin wounds with sutures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nonabsorbable sutures are used for skin closure and permanent internal placement, such as cardiac valves. Common nonabsorbable sutures include silk, nylon, and polypropylene (Prolene). Silk and nylon sutures can be braided, adding strength and improving knotting potential, but they are more likely to harbor infection. Polypropylene and unbraided nylon are monofilaments and are less likely to harbor infection, but knots are less secure and more difficult to tie [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/10,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,31</a>]. Polypropylene should be considered for the scalp, primarily because it is blue and easy to see. Silk and gut, as natural materials, cause considerable tissue inflammation and have been largely replaced by synthetic suture material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/10,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,31</a>].</p><p>Suture size is indicated by the code O: the more O's, the smaller the suture diameter. Generally, 4-O or 5-O monofilament nylon can be used on the body and scalp, and 6-O nylon on the face [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/6,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14</a>].</p><p>Suture needles are made of noncorrosive stainless steel that is forged to achieve maximum strength and ductility, the ability to bend under pressure without breaking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Three types of needle points are common: cutting; tapered; and blunt. Cutting needles allow for easy passage through tough tissue and are ideal for skin.</p><p>A code has been developed to denote the purpose of the needle. For skin (FS) and cutting needles (CE) are used on thick skin, while plastic (P), plastic skin (PS), and premium (PRE) are used for cosmetic closures. The size of the needle is ranked by a number, with higher numbers identifying larger needles. Needle curvature is measured in terms of proportion of a circle, with one-quarter, one-half, and three-eighths curves available.</p><p>Most biopsy wounds in thick skin can be closed using an FS-3 or CE-3 needle; P-3 can be used for the face, all with a three-eighths curvature. C-17 needles were developed specifically to close punch biopsies and are less expensive than FS, CE, P, or PRE needles.</p><p>Reassess the appropriateness of the instruments when wound closing seems more difficult than expected. Needle selection is often a prime factor determining the ease of suturing and final cosmetic result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A larger needle may decrease the difficulty of the job.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Closing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common closure technique is a simple, interrupted suture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To begin, grasp the needle with the needle-holder at midpoint or about one-third the distance from the eye. This will provide maximum driving force and diminish the likelihood of bending or breaking the needle. A palm grip is recommended to increase the driving force of the needle through the skin. Place the handle of the holder in the palm, wrap the thumb and fingers around the handles, and extend the index finger down over the tip of the holder near the needle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The needle point is placed perpendicular to the skin surface about 2 mm away from the wound edge and is driven down, then up into the center of the wound. A second insertion begins in the center of the wound and exits the skin on the opposite side, 2 mm from the wound edge, perpendicular to the surface. If done properly, the suture will make a flask-shaped loop; the loop beneath the skin surface is farther apart than the entry and exit points on the surface. A needle exit in the middle of the wound is not necessary for small excisional wounds and for most punch wounds, but depends upon the size of the needle and the ease that the wound edges can be approximated and everted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To tie the suture, hold the needle holder parallel to the long axis of the wound with the free end and needle end of the suture on either side of the holder. Wrap the needle end of the suture twice around the holder, then grasp the free end of the suture with the holder and pull through, tightening the knot. At this point the needle end and free end of the suture should have switched sides relative to the beginning. The process is repeated as needed, reversing the position of the free end and needle end of the suture with each knot. &quot;Approximate, don't strangulate&quot; acknowledges the importance of proper tension on the suture. Excessive tension can be recognized by blanching of the wound edges, and may indicate the need for subcutaneous sutures or simply less tension on each suture.</p><p/><p>Placement of sutures for elliptical excisions can be facilitated by following the &quot;rule of halves&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The wound is divided in half by the initial suture placement, and each half is itself halved by the subsequent placement of sutures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F96327\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef96327 \">figure 4</a>). Similar halving continues until all wound edges are approximated. Starting the initial suture at an apex rather than the middle runs the risk of &quot;dog ears&quot; at the opposite apex owing to the creation of uneven wound edges.</p><p>The skin tension can be reduced in large wounds by placing a temporary initial suture at the midpoint of the wound, but farther from the edge than usual. At a later time, this suture can be removed as the wound is approximated with the permanent sutures.</p><p>Diamond and hexagonal excisions are easily closed by placing the initial sutures at the two opposing points of the diamond or four opposing points of the hexagon, then adding other sutures as necessary to completely approximate the wound. The straight lines of the diamond and hexagon provide better approximation of edges for the beginner than do the curved surfaces of the ellipse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Wound dressing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wounds heal faster when moist and under an occlusive or semiocclusive dressing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Thus, to avoid the potential complication of contact dermatitis, we suggest the use of petrolatum for dressing clean wounds from skin biopsies and excisions.</p><p>All biopsy wounds should be dressed with a thin film of the occlusive ointment to prevent crust formation, then covered with an adhesive bandage or other nonadherent covering and topped with a gauze dressing and tape [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/14,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,32</a>]. The dressing should be removed in 12 to 24 hours and cleaned with soap and water twice daily. After cleaning, the wound should be covered with the occlusive ointment. Wounds healing by secondary intention need to be redressed after each cleaning until healed over or for at least five days; covering the wound site is optional for sutured wounds. Showering is permitted after 24 hours for sutured wounds, but bathing and use of hot tubs are prohibited until the sutures are removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Suture removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a balance between the tendency for wound dehiscence or stretching if the sutures are removed too early and the production of suture marks if they remain too long [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-biopsy-techniques/abstract/10,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,31</a>].

Skin biopsies may be performed with shave, punch, or excisional techniques. The type of skin lesion and the location of the biopsy are important factors to consider when choosing which procedure to perform. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Site selection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Choice of procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common anesthetic used for skin biopsies is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Epinephrine</a> may be added to lidocaine to induce vasoconstriction, which decreases bleeding and prolongs anesthesia. Several techniques are useful for decreasing the pain associated with injection. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shave biopsies are typically used for lesions for which sampling of the full thickness of the dermis is not necessary. Shave biopsies are performed with a number 15 scalpel blade or a razor blade. Aluminum chloride or another topical hemostatic agent is used to control bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Choice of procedure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Shave biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Punch biopsies involve the removal of a core-shape piece of tissue and allow sampling of the deep dermis. Punch biopsy wounds can be closed with suture or left to heal by secondary intention. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Choice of procedure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Punch biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excisions are more time consuming than punch or shave biopsies, but are useful for biopsies of larger or deeper lesions. Careful technique is necessary to achieve a good cosmetic result and to reduce the risk of complications. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Choice of procedure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Excision'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excisional biopsy is the preferred procedure for biopsy of pigmented lesions that are suspicious for melanoma. Only clinicians who are experienced with the deep shave biopsy technique should perform this procedure on pigmented lesions. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Pigmented lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical information is useful for pathologists as they interpret the findings in skin biopsies. A clinical description of the lesion and brief history should be submitted with a biopsy specimen.
