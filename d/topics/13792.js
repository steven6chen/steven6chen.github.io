The genome of the organisms is only 660 million daltons, smaller than any other prokaryote except mycoplasma. They do not contain a peptidoglycan in the cell wall. The growth cycle of the organism is complex and biphasic, consisting of two distinct entities: elementary (EB) and reticulate bodies (RB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-species-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The form in which the bacterium multiplies is the RB, which is intracellular. Replication occurs within a membrane-bound inclusion. RB are unstable and revert to EB within the inclusion, which then ruptures, causing release of EB, which are the form that survives in the extracellular environment; EB are the infectious particles.</p><p>The signal that triggers RB to EB reversion is not known. EB attach to epithelial cells and enter cells via a phagosome. Once inside, EB reorganize to RB, which then replicate. Polymorphic membrane proteins are found on the surface of EBs of multiple <em>Chlamydia</em> species including <em>C. psittaci</em> and may induce antibody production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-species-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Two species of <em>Chlamydia</em> are primarily associated with pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-species-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>C. pneumoniae</em>, which has only the single strain, TWAR, and causes respiratory infection.

As a result, reinfection or persistent infection and its associated inflammatory response are common, particularly with ocular and genital infections, in which an ongoing immune reaction can lead to scarring and blindness or infertility, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-species-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>An association between <em>Chlamydia</em> pulmonary infections and acute airway hyperreactivity has been noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-species-in-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In some cases of new wheezing, for example, serologic evidence for <em>Chlamydia</em> infection (which may be acute or chronic) has been found. However, the absence of clear documentation of acute infection (by culture or polymerase chain reaction) makes it difficult to determine a true etiologic role for <em>Chlamydia</em> species in asthma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CHLAMYDIA PNEUMONIAE INFECTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>C. pneumoniae</em> is the most common <em>Chlamydia</em> species to cause pulmonary infection. The incidence of <em>C. pneumoniae</em> pneumonia is greatest in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-species-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Transmission of the organism is thought to be person-to-person.</p><p>The estimated incidence of <em>C. pneumoniae</em> lower respiratory tract infection among children and adults is 100 cases per 100,000 population; the incidence is greatest in those aged 65 to 79 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-species-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Studies from around the world have found evidence of <em>C. pneumoniae</em> pneumonia in 0.3 to 44 percent of children with lower respiratory tract infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-species-in-children/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. One study used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in addition to culture and serology to establish the etiologic agent in 168 ambulatory children with community-acquired pneumonia; the following distribution was noted for the 43 percent of patients in whom a pathogen was found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-species-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> &ndash; 27 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral pathogens &ndash; 20 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> as the sole agent &ndash; 7 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>C. pneumoniae</em> &ndash; 6 percent</p><p/><p>Fifteen patients had more than one pathogen identified; six of these had coinfection with <em>C. pneumoniae</em> and <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, and one had coinfection with <em>C. pneumoniae</em> and <em>M. pneumoniae</em>. In similar studies of children hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, <em>C. pneumoniae</em> was identified in approximately 7 to 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-species-in-children/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In another study, <em>C. pneumoniae</em> was detected by PCR in 11 percent of nasopharyngeal samples collected from 675 Peruvian children hospitalized with an acute respiratory infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-species-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Most cases occurred in infants 29 days to 2 months (26 percent) and in children 1 to 5 years of age (25 percent). However, testing for coinfection with typical bacterial and viral pathogens was not performed.</p><p>The true incidence of <em>C. pneumoniae</em> infection is not known because of difficulties in confirming the diagnosis. Epidemiologic studies of <em>Chlamydia</em> infection must be interpreted with caution because most of them rely upon serology. Serologic testing is not standardized, and variability in both assay conditions and interpretation of thresholds for positivity complicate comparison of one study to another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-species-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>In a study that compared culture and serologic diagnosis in 91 patients with lower respiratory infection (74 children, 17 adult), 19 percent had evidence of <em>C. pneumoniae</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-species-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, some patients were culture positive without serologic evidence of acute infection, and others were culture negative with antibody titers indicative of acute infection. In addition, several patients were culture positive repeatedly for 12 months. These findings suggest that <em>C. pneumoniae</em> infection is common, especially in outpatients, but serologic methods of establishing incidence are problematic because of repeated and persistent infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No distinguishing clinical characteristics identify cases of <em>C. pneumoniae</em> infection.

Common features include gradual onset of symptoms, associated pharyngitis, and often hoarseness.

Thus, it is rare to definitively establish a diagnosis of <em>C. pneumoniae</em> in the clinical setting, and treatment is most often on an empirical basis.</p><p>Most laboratories are not well equipped to culture <em>Chlamydia</em> spp, which requires cell culture techniques.

Microimmunofluorescence, in contrast, is quite sensitive and specific and can distinguish among species, but is not readily available.</p><p>Direct antigen testing and PCR appear to be the most promising advances.

Thirty of 56 patients with respiratory symptoms were found positive by one or more methods. Compared with DFA or culture, the sensitivity of PCR-EIA was 76 percent and specificity 99 percent. PCR-EIA is easier to perform than culture and may nearly match its sensitivity.
