The long-term outcome of low back pain is generally favorable. In one prospective study, 90 percent of patients with low back pain seen initially in primary care did not seek care after three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, given how common low back pain is, persistent symptoms affect millions of individuals. Subacute low back pain is commonly defined as back pain lasting between 4 and 12 weeks and chronic low back pain as pain that persists for 12 or more weeks.</p><p>The initial evaluation of patients with low back pain, regardless of its duration, includes history taking and a targeted physical examination focusing on neurologic screening to exclude serious underlying pathology (eg, malignancy, infection, or cauda equina syndrome). On the basis of this evaluation, patients are triaged into broad diagnostic categories that include nonspecific low back pain, radiculopathy, or other specific pathology (eg, spinal stenosis, ankylosing spondylitis, and vertebral compression fracture) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of low back pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most patients (&gt;85 percent) who are seen in primary care have &quot;nonspecific low back pain,&quot; which is low back pain that cannot reliably be attributed to a specific disease or spinal pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Rapid improvement in pain and disability and return to work are the norm in the first month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients who do not improve within four weeks of the onset of low back symptoms should be reevaluated and may require further diagnostic testing to identify a specific cause for their symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults#H460847501\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of low back pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Risk assessment subacute back pain'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults#H773510996\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of low back pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Risk assessment chronic back pain'</a>.)</p><p>Despite persistent pain, patients with subacute symptoms still have a favorable prognosis. For patients whose symptoms persist beyond three months, however, the goal of treatment moves from &quot;cure&quot; to controlling pain, maintaining function, and preventing disability. Factors associated with development of chronic disability include preexisting psychologic conditions, other types of chronic pain, job dissatisfaction or stress, and dispute over compensation issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Effective methods for reducing the risk of progression to chronic pain have not been definitively identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>It is likely that many patients with chronic low back pain are not receiving evidence-based care. One survey of households in North Carolina, for example, identified 732 adults with chronic low back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Responses indicated overutilization of unproven interventions (traction, corsets), high use of second-line medications (opioids and muscle relaxants), and underutilization of exercise therapy and, for patients with depression, antidepressants.</p><p>A glossary of terms used in the discussion of low back pain is presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79662\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79662 \">table 1</a>). Criteria used in this review to classify magnitude of benefits for the most commonly reported outcomes (pain relief or improvement in function) are presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58592\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58592 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Relatively few randomized trials have evaluated patients specifically with subacute low back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], sciatica, or spinal stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Results from trials evaluating mixed populations (subacute with either acute or chronic patients) are commonly applied to both groups. This topic presents recommendations for initial management of patients with subacute and chronic low back pain. Interventional and surgical therapies for subacute and chronic low back pain and treatment recommendations for acute low back pain are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonsurgical-interventional-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Nonsurgical interventional treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-surgical-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Surgical treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute low back pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A summary of the multiple interventions for subacute and chronic low back pain discussed in these topics is presented in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72902\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72902 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61982\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61982 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F77165\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77165 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63348 \">table 6</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2030527676\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH TO CARE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97223825\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with subacute and chronic low back pain should receive advice on self-care and instruction on the importance of maintaining activity as tolerated (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Self-care advice'</a> below). We generally advise nonpharmacologic therapy initially and favor &ldquo;active&rdquo; interventions that are movement-based <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> address psychosocial contributors to pain. These include exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), tai chi, yoga, other relaxation techniques (mindfulness-based stress reduction [MBSR], biofeedback, and progressive relaxation), and multidisciplinary rehabilitation. An emphasis on active therapies is consistent with a biopsychosocial approach to pain, engages patients in their care, and more directly aims to improve function, not just reduce pain. More &ldquo;passive&rdquo; interventions, such as acupuncture or spinal manipulation, can be used as adjunctive treatments during symptom flares.</p><p>For patients with subacute low back pain who have a high likelihood of spontaneous remission, self-care interventions and patient education may be sufficient. In persons with more severe symptoms who have risk factors for chronicity or who are not improving with self-care and education, short-term interventions such as superficial heat, massage, exercise therapy, spinal manipulation, or acupuncture may be considered. The choice among these interventions also depends on patient preference and their cost and accessibility; there are no data demonstrating superiority of one over another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Activity and physical treatments'</a> below and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Psychologic interventions'</a> below and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Physical modalities'</a> below.)</p><p>Pharmacologic therapy is reasonable for those who have inadequate symptom control with nonpharmacologic measures. For patients with subacute low back pain who warrant pharmacologic therapy, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) with or without a nonbenzodiazepine skeletal muscle relaxant is preferred over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>. For patients with chronic low back pain who have had an inadequate response to nonpharmacologic therapy, we suggest an NSAID as initial therapy and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a> as second-line therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3682607022\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapies'</a> below.)</p><p>Clinicians should consider opioids as an option in patients who have not responded to these management approaches only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks. (See <a href=\"#H1891222823\" class=\"local\">'Use of opioids'</a> below.)</p><p>This approach is consistent with the 2017 updated guideline from the American College of Physicians for the management of acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Self-care advice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with low back pain, regardless of duration or severity, should be instructed in self-care techniques. Initial advice should stress the importance of maintaining activity as tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients who require a period of bedrest to relieve severe symptoms should be encouraged to return to normal activities as soon as possible.</p><p>A systematic review of randomized trials has found that bedrest did not improve either function or pain, compared with usual activity, for patients with sciatica [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Advice to remain active was as effective as &quot;standard&quot; physical therapy (any combination of exercises, mobilization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> manipulation, superficial heat or cold, and advice) for improvement in function in a randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, patients randomly assigned to physical therapy were more likely to report a perceived benefit than those receiving activity advice.</p><p>Self-care education books based on evidence-based guidelines (such as The Back Book [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]) are an inexpensive and efficient method for supplementing clinician-provided back information and advice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Several randomized trials have shown self-care education books to be similar in effectiveness, or only slightly inferior, to interventions with higher direct costs, such as supervised exercise, massage, acupuncture, and spinal manipulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/16,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20-22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Bed mattress choice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence regarding how bed mattress choice impacts back pain is limited. A medium-firm mattress may be the preferred mattress choice for patients with chronic back pain, based on findings from a European randomized trial (n = 313) in which patients randomly assigned to a firm mattress, compared with a medium-firm mattress, were less likely to experience improvement in pain-related disability at 90 days (68 versus 82 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The medium-firm mattress was superior to a firm mattress for improvement of pain while lying in bed (odds ratio [OR] 2.36, 95% CI 1.13-4.93) and pain-related disability (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.24-3.56).</p><p>Although these results suggest providers should not recommend a firm mattress for chronic low back pain, the firmness rating scale was a European standard, and the term &quot;medium-firm&quot; may mean different things to different manufacturers in different countries.</p><p>Another randomized study comparing back conforming mattresses (waterbed and foam) with a firm mattress suggested less pain and improved sleep for the conforming mattresses, with higher dropout rates for patients assigned to the firm mattress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Lumbar supports</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no compelling evidence that lumbar supports are effective in patients with chronic low back pain. A systematic review of eight trials for the use of lumbar supports in the treatment of low back pain found overall poor study quality, inadequate randomization, and generally low compliance with the intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The conclusion was that there was conflicting evidence whether lumbar supports used as supplements to other treatments were effective in the treatment of low back pain. A French multicenter open-label randomized trial published subsequent to the systematic review found that use of an elastic belt in patients with subacute low back pain modestly reduced the need for pain medication and improved functional status at 30 and 90 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, longer-term outcomes are unknown, and if use of a belt leads to avoidance behaviors by reinforcing awareness of a &quot;back problem&quot; and activity restriction, it may discourage exercise participation. Thus, while lumbar supports are not routinely recommended, they may provide some benefit for patients with subacute low back pain who are actively engaged in recommended therapies, such as exercise, and who will remain active.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">ACTIVITY AND PHYSICAL TREATMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to self-care instruction, all patients with subacute and chronic low back pain should be advised to remain as active as possible and to incorporate physical therapies into their treatment plan.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of different types of exercise are commonly used in patients with subacute or chronic low back pain. Exercise programs include motor control exercise (also known as specific stabilization exercise), core strengthening (eg, abdominal and trunk extensor), <span class=\"nowrap\">flexion/extension</span> movements, directional preference, general physical fitness, aerobic exercise, mind-body exercises (eg, yoga and Pilates), and functional restoration programs. Most exercise programs appear to be similarly effective, though a systematic review found that motor control exercise was associated with slightly less pain intensity and better function than general exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Exercise therapy is safe, readily available, helps alleviate pain symptoms, and improves functionality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-based therapy for low back pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal manipulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal manipulation is a form of manual therapy that involves the movement of a joint beyond its usual end range of motion, but not past its anatomic range of motion (termed the &quot;paraphysiologic zone&quot;). Loads are applied to the spine using short- or long-lever methods. Short-lever high-velocity movement of the joint is frequently accompanied by an audible cracking or popping sound. Spinal manipulation is most commonly associated with chiropractic providers, but is also performed by other providers, including osteopathic clinicians and physical therapists. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal manipulation in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain&quot;, section on 'Types of manipulation'</a>.)</p><p>A 2011 meta-analysis including 26 randomized trials in patients with chronic low back pain compared spinal manipulation with multiple treatments (general practitioner care, analgesics, physical therapy, exercises, or back school, massage, ultrasound, transcutaneous muscle stimulation, and attending a pain clinic) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Spinal manipulation had small short-term effects on reducing pain and improving functional status compared with other interventions. Subsequent randomized trials support the finding of short-term benefits of spinal manipulation in patients with subacute and chronic low back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. A randomized trial of 192 patients with subacute and chronic back-related leg pain evaluated home exercise and advice with or without spinal manipulative therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Spinal manipulation modestly improved leg pain at 12 weeks but not at 52 weeks. Another randomized trial in 107 adults with acute and subacute low back pain found that compared with usual care, manual spinal manipulation improved self-reported short-term disability and pain scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Serious adverse events following lumbar spinal manipulation (such as worsening lumbar disc herniation or cauda equina syndrome) are rare. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal manipulation in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain&quot;, section on 'Risks of spinal manipulation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Acupuncture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acupuncture is an intervention consisting of the insertion of needles at specific predetermined acupuncture points. Evidence on the efficacy of acupuncture versus sham acupuncture is inconsistent. Systematic reviews found acupuncture moderately more effective than no treatment for short-term (&lt;3 months) pain relief and improvement in function, and more effective than sham acupuncture for pain relief, but not for improvement in function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. However, two well-blinded trials not included in the systematic reviews found no difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture for either pain or function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>], although a subsequent meta-analysis including these studies still found that acupuncture reduced pain compared with sham and improved function compared with no intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. It is unclear if the effectiveness of sham acupuncture derives from some attribute of superficial needling or is solely a placebo effect. Acupuncture is likely to be most beneficial in patients who have high expectations of benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acupuncture#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acupuncture&quot;, section on 'Low back pain'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Massage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interpretation of studies to evaluate the effectiveness of massage therapy in chronic low back pain is hampered by differences in the comparator interventions, types of massage, and duration and frequency of massage sessions. A systematic review including 25 trials found limited evidence for short-term benefits of massage. When compared with inactive controls, there was evidence of short-term improvement in symptoms for subacute and chronic low back pain, but no long-term benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>For example, one large randomized trial in 579 patients with chronic or recurrent low back pain found that six sessions of massage therapy, with or without a minimal exercise intervention, reduced disability and pain at three months compared with usual care, but benefits were not sustained at 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Another trial in 401 patients with chronic, nonspecific low back pain found that 10 sessions of massage therapy reduced disability and pain at 10 weeks compared with usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

A systematic review found cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) superior to waitlist control for short-term pain relief, although there were no differences in function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

In a subsequent, 12-month randomized trial in patients with subacute or chronic low back pain, those randomly assigned to group CBT reported less pain and disability compared with no further treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2210678557\"><span class=\"h2\">Mind-body interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mind-body interventions, such as meditation and mindfulness techniques, have been evaluated for the treatment of chronic low back pain. Such interventions often incorporate cognitive behavioral principles and may include a movement component (eg, tai chi, yoga). There is some evidence that these interventions may be effective, but more research is needed to define optimal approaches.</p><p>Mindfulness-based stress reduction is a mind-body intervention that can be administered in group settings by laypersons. In a meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials involving 864 patients with low back pain, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) was associated with modest short-term improvements in pain intensity (mean difference [MD] -0.96 point on an 11-point numerical rating scale; 95% CI, -1.64 to -0.34) and physical functioning (MD 2.50 on SF-36 physical functioning subscale; 95% CI, 0.90 to 4.10) compared with usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. There were no serious adverse events reported.</p><p>As an example, in one of the trials included in the meta-analysis, among 342 adults with chronic low back pain, MBSR or CBT (training to change pain-related thoughts and behaviors) were more likely to have clinically meaningful improvement in self-reported function (MBSR, 60.5 percent; CBT, 57.7 percent; usual care, 44.1 percent) and pain bothersomeness (MBSR, 43.6 percent; CBT, 44.9 percent; usual care, 26.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

A systematic review identified no trials of individual education versus no education, although it included three trials that found no differences between individual education and non-educational interventions (exercise therapy, yoga, or back school) in pain or function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Data on the comparative effectiveness of different educational approaches or content are also limited. One trial found that education that focuses on the neurophysiology of pain, including psychosocial contributors (also known as pain neurophysiology education or pain neuroscience education), is slightly more effective at improving short-term pain (difference of about 5 points on a 0 to 100 point pain scale) than education that focuses on biomechanical aspects of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Education was provided by trained physical therapists. Independent validation of these results is needed, as the trial was conducted by the same group that published the pain neurophysiology education manual.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1096130617\"><span class=\"h2\">Back school</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Back school is an intervention originally developed in Sweden consisting of education and a skill program including exercise therapy. Generally, lessons are provided to groups of patients and supervised by a physical therapist or other therapist trained in back rehabilitation, although the content of back school interventions vary and back school based on the traditional Swedish approach is not widely available in the United States. Back school may be a reasonable therapeutic option in patients with subacute or chronic low back pain who are interested in it, but there is limited evidence supporting its effectiveness. There is overlap between back school and group exercise, educational interventions, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation.</p><p>A 2017 meta-analysis found very low-quality evidence that back school was modestly more effective than no treatment for short-term pain control (six trials; mean difference [MD] -6.10 on 0-100 point scales, 95% CI -10.18 to -2.01) and reducing short-term disability (three trials; MD -3.38 on 0-100 scales, 95% CI -6.70 to -0.05), but these effects were not seen in intermediate- or long-term follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In addition, back school was no more effective for pain control than medical care, passive physiotherapy, or exercise in intermediate- or long-term follow-up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Multidisciplinary (interdisciplinary) rehabilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multidisciplinary, or interdisciplinary, rehabilitation combines physical, vocational, educational, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> behavioral components provided by multiple health care professionals. Intensity and content of interdisciplinary therapy vary widely. These programs combine graded exercise therapy with a psychosocial approach, generally involving a psychologist. Multidisciplinary therapy can be similar to functional restoration programs but emphasizes multiple providers and behavioral interventions rather than focusing on occupational aspects of rehabilitation.</p><p>A systematic review of 41 trials found multidisciplinary rehabilitation that included a physical component with a psychological component <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a <span class=\"nowrap\">social/work-targeted</span> component delivered by clinicians with different professional backgrounds was associated with larger improvements in pain and function than usual care or non-multidisciplinary physical treatments (eg, exercise therapy, physical modalities, manual therapy, education) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Differences were about 0.5 points on a 0 to 10 point pain scale and 1.5 points on the Roland Morris functional scale. Multidisciplinary treatment also increased the likelihood of return to work compared with non-multidisciplinary physical treatments (odds ratio [OR] 1.87, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.47). There was no clear effect of intervention intensity on effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation.</p><p>Patients are more likely to benefit from multidisciplinary rehabilitation and functional restoration if they are highly motivated, as the most effective regimens are intensive. The high cost of the more intensive programs limit their applicability; they may be most appropriate for patients who do not respond to single interventions or as an alternative to surgery. We advise referring clinicians be familiar with outcomes for specific programs, given the cost and heterogeneity of quality among programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Multidisciplinary programs may not be available in many communities. They are usually practiced in pain clinics or rehabilitation centers. It is uncertain whether providing the components of multidisciplinary rehabilitation outside of a formal program is as effective as a coordinated program. If not available, the primary care clinician may be left the task of coordinating a collaborative arrangement between the various specialists, for which the logistics are burdensome. Primary care clinicians may need to develop and coordinate an individualized care program, involving a physical or occupational therapist, a behavioral psychologist experienced in patients with musculoskeletal symptoms, and a rehabilitation or occupational clinician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Functional restoration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional restoration, also known as work hardening, work conditioning, or physical conditioning involves simulated or actual work tests in a supervised environment to improve strength, endurance, flexibility, and fitness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

A 2014 systematic review evaluated randomized trials of herbal therapies in patients with acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain. The review found that compared with placebo, the evidence for effectiveness was the best for topical <em>Capsicum frutescens</em> (cayenne), with some evidence for oral <em>Harpagophytum procumbens</em> (Devil's claw), oral <em>Salix alba</em> (white willow bark), topical <em>Symphytum officinale</em> (comfrey root extract), and topical lavender essential oil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>].

Additionally, herbal medications may interact with other medications and may contain impurities, and some have significant adverse effects. Patients should be asked about what nonprescription and herbal medications they are taking for their pain, and this information should be recorded in the medical record.
