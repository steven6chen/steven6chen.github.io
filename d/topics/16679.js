However, many patients who are initially resected eventually relapse, and the prognosis in these cases is often poor. Thus, optimal management requires careful surveillance for recurrent disease in those who have undergone a potentially curative resection.</p><p>The timing and patterns of recurrent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> metastatic disease and specific recommendations for surveillance following the initial treatment of localized RCC will be reviewed here. An overview of the treatment of RCC is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognostic factors in patients with renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The advantages of an aggressive surveillance program must be balanced against the financial costs and the psychologic distress that repeated testing can cause the patient. The rationale for surveillance is based upon several observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of recurrence while the metastatic burden is limited may increase the likelihood of a favorable response to systemic treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunotherapy-of-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunotherapy of renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical resection of a single or limited number of metastases or an isolated local-regional recurrence can result in long-term survival.

As a result, the primary surveillance efforts focus on this period. From years 3 to 5, close follow-up with imaging can become less frequent.</p><p>The optimal time to discontinue surveillance is unclear, as there are patients who have local or distant recurrence greater than ten years after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As an example, a series of 1088 patients who recurred after kidney cancer surgery were assessed by current guidelines. There were significant numbers of recurrences missed by stopping surveillance after five years. Extending surveillance to 15 years would capture 95 percent of recurrences; however, it would be significantly more costly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Most surveillance protocols now recommend that a follow-up plan of duration greater than five years be individualized at the discretion of the treating clinician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2614797\"><span class=\"h2\">Late recurrences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The features of patients with late recurrences were analyzed in a series of 1454 patients who were disease-free a minimum of five years after nephrectomy for localized RCC. With a median postoperative follow-up of 14 years, 63 patients (4 percent) who were disease-free at five years have relapsed. The estimated recurrence-free survival rates for a renal recurrence at 10 and 15 years after surgery were 97 percent and 95 percent, respectively. The distant metastasis-free survival rates at 10 and 15 years were 93 and 86 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>On multivariate analysis, risk factors associated with late distant metastasis included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor size (1 centimeter increase) (hazard ratio [HR] 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.14)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>pT1b (HR 2.81, 95% CI 1.61-4.91)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>pT2a (HR 4.45, 95% CI 2.34-8.47)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>pT2b (HR 3.38, 95% CI 1.39-8.23)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>pT3a-b, pT2c, pT4 (HR 5.09, 95% CI 2.68-9.67)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clear cell histology or collecting duct, not otherwise specified (HR 3.76, 95% CI 2.12-6.66)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SITES OF METASTASIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common sites of metastatic disease from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are the lungs, bones, liver, renal fossa, and brain, although recurrences may occur elsewhere.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung metastases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lung metastases have been reported in 29 to 54 percent of patients with recurrent RCC and are the most common site of metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. When surveillance chest radiographs are performed, greater than 90 percent of lung metastases are diagnosed when the patient is asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/6,7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,9</a>].

Whether computed tomography (CT) or plain chest radiograph is optimal remains uncertain, although CT is now being used more routinely. It is not clear that the increased sensitivity of chest CT offers additional benefit compared with plain chest radiograph. Many risk-stratified protocols utilize chest CT for high-risk populations but do mention alternating usage with chest radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

Routine imaging with plain films or bone scan is not recommended, and these tests are reserved to confirm a suspicion of metastasis and to evaluate suspicious findings observed on chest and abdominal scans. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance protocols'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone scan &ndash; The use of a radionuclide bone scan beyond that of history and physical examination is generally restricted to symptomatic patients. This was illustrated in a series of 1357 patients with RCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Among the 167 cases with bone metastases, 96 percent were symptomatic, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 1 or greater (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 1</a>). Among all patients who were asymptomatic (ie, a performance score of 0), only 1.4 percent had bone metastases. In addition, bone scans may be relatively insensitive at detecting the largely lytic metastatic lesions occurring in RCC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alkaline phosphatase &ndash; Monitoring the serum alkaline phosphatase is simple and inexpensive, but elevated values are seen in only 40 to 55 percent of patients with documented bone metastasis; in addition, its specificity is poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/13,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,17</a>]. Elevations in serum alkaline phosphatase may also be due to liver metastases or a paraneoplastic syndrome.

In about 90 percent of cases, such metastases are detected because of symptoms or abnormal laboratory values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. Consequently, all surveillance regimens utilize periodic history, physical examination, and liver function tests to assess for symptoms, hepatomegaly, and laboratory abnormalities. Abdominal CT is the best tool to detect liver metastases, which may be present even in the absence of symptoms or abnormal liver function tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>].</p><p>Early detection of liver metastases allows carefully selected patients to undergo local therapies such as radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy, or metastasectomy, although the evidence supporting the clinical benefit of such an approach is anecdotal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

Local recurrence is more common in patients with locally advanced tumors and those with sarcomatoid histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Although the rate of isolated local recurrence following radical nephrectomy varies with patient selection, such relapses are uncommon. In a series of over 1700 patients from the Mayo Clinic who underwent radical nephrectomy for localized (T1-T3N0M0) RCC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110735\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110735 \">table 2</a>), isolated recurrence in the renal fossa was identified in less than 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Of these 30 patients with isolated local recurrence, 60 percent were symptomatic and 40 percent were found on routine follow-up evaluation.</p><p>Early diagnosis of patients with isolated local recurrence is important because surgical resection of such relapses may improve outcome by preventing progression to disseminated disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Retrospective series have evaluated the outcome following such resection, although this presumably represents a highly selected population. As an example, in 102 patients who underwent resection of an isolated retroperitoneal recurrence at MD Anderson Cancer Center, metastatic progression was observed in 59 percent with a median follow-up of 32 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Approximately 30 percent of patients remained recurrence-free at 10 years of follow-up. The median cancer-specific survival with resection of a local recurrence was more than five years.</p><p>Limited data are available for resection of local recurrence after partial nephrectomy; however, these tumors are often smaller and lower-stage, and thus are likely to have similar or improved outcomes with surgery.</p><p>Although the incidence of isolated local recurrence is low, abdominal CT is recommended to simultaneously evaluate for liver metastasis and local recurrence.

As an example, in a single-institution series of 138 patients with brain metastases, 95 percent had extracranial sites of metastasis when brain metastases were diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT is reserved for the evaluation of symptomatic patients or at the time of extracranial recurrence.</p><p>As a result, brain imaging studies (either MRI or CT with contrast) should be performed in patients being considered for immunotherapy or anti-angiogenic therapy for extracranial metastases because of the risk of treatment-associated toxicity or hemorrhage.

In this analysis, clear cell tumors preferentially spread to the lungs, while chromophobe tumors more frequently metastasized to the liver. Based on differential sites of metastasis and time to metastasis, histology-specific protocols have been recommended with differential chest and abdominal imaging surveillance intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

As these are validated, such biomarkers may enable refinements in surveillance protocols following definitive treatment of RCC.</p><p>Both UCLA and Mayo groups have developed predictive models that incorporate panels of biomarkers with clinicopathologic information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The addition of these biomarkers appears to improve the predictive capability of these models. Neither model has been externally or prospectively validated, but this concept probably represents the future of prognostication.</p><p>Challenges to the adoption of these biomarker-based systems include the variability of tissue preparation and storage, and in interpretation of immunohistochemical scoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. For these reasons, a cytogenetic approach may be more easily adopted as many centers have facilities capable of performing this technique. Cytogenetic evaluation of renal tumors has been routinely performed at UCLA, and assessment of chromosomal alterations can aid in prognostication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognostic factors in patients with renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognostic factors in patients with renal cell carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Molecular markers'</a>.) </p><p>With the expansion of genomic characterization, there is some hope that next-generation sequencing could assist with prognostication. Specific mutations in chromatin remodeling genes such as <em>BAP1</em> may lead to a worse prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Challenges exist in using genomic sequencing to determine mutational status due to significant intra-tumor heterogeneity. A biopsy of a single site may not adequately assess a specific gene alteration, as over half of mutations in driver alterations are often not shared throughout the tumor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H263461748\"><span class=\"h1\">SURVEILLANCE AFTER THERMOABLATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thermoablation is increasingly being utilized as an alternative to nephrectomy for the clinical T1 renal cell carcinoma (RCC). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiofrequency-ablation-and-cryoablation-for-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation for renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Both radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation can be performed through an open, laparoscopic, or percutaneous approach, and it appears that both procedures have similar oncologic outcomes. Compared with partial nephrectomy, there is a 5 to 20-fold increased risk for local recurrence, while the risk for developing distant metastases appears to be similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>Therefore, it is crucial to monitor the ablated kidney for local recurrence. Recurrent tumors can successfully be treated with repeated ablation or surgery. The proposed surveillance scheme mirrors the one from the intermediate- and high-risk groups of patients treated with nephrectomy. Following radiofrequency ablation, some authors advocate a biopsy at six months, as there is poor correlation between imaging and pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surveillance-for-metastatic-disease-after-definitive-treatment-for-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3420528\"><span class=\"h1\">ADJUVANT THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical trials have not demonstrated any benefit in the adjuvant setting for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). These have included chemotherapy, immunotherapy with cytokines and tumor vaccines, and targeted therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a>.

There are no randomized trials demonstrating increased survival from active surveillance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following complete resection of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), patients should be monitored for evidence of local recurrence, distant metastasis, or a second primary RCC. Contemporary recommendations for surveillance incorporate information from the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system along with other key prognostic factors. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance protocols'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surveillance protocols focus on the sites most frequently involved with metastases, including the lung, bones, liver, and renal fossa, and match testing with the period of greatest risk of recurrence. These surveillance protocols must be adjusted for the needs of the individual patient based upon clinical judgment and experience. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Sites of metastasis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Time to recurrence'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance protocols'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) are similarly efficient in detecting both locoregional and distant metastases and provide a useful tool for patient management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F104872\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104872 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F104874\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104874 \">table 4</a>).
