Neurologic etiologies, such as seizures or migraine headaches, are present in up to 20 percent of patients.

A cardiac etiology for syncope is particularly important to identify. In most children, cardiac syncope is suggested by a careful history (including a detailed family history), physical examination, and electrocardiogram (ECG) and is a rare etiology for pediatric syncope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F91373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91373 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-evaluation-of-syncope-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective, multicenter observational study of over 1200 patients undergoing a standardized ambulatory evaluation by a pediatric cardiologist, 85 percent of patients were diagnosed with typical syncope based upon history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (ECG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-evaluation-of-syncope-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Abnormal values include a decrease in systolic blood pressure by 10 mmHg or an increase in heart rate by 20 beats per minute from sitting to standing. A marked increased in heart rate (40 beats per minute or greater) is consistent with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition and causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the etiology of syncopal events in children and adolescents is most often benign, syncope can also occur as the result of more serious (usually cardiac) disease with the potential for sudden death (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60014\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60014 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition and causes'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-syncope-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of syncope in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An algorithmic approach to the emergency evaluation of the child with syncope is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53383\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef53383 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A combination of historical features, physical examination, and ECG findings typically identifies children and adolescents with a life-threatening cardiac cause of syncope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F91373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91373 \">table 2</a>). These patients warrant urgent consultation with or referral to a pediatric cardiologist. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3047172585\" class=\"local\">'Indications for referral or admission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory studies that may be helpful in selected patients include rapid blood glucose, hematocrit, urine pregnancy test (post menarcheal females), and, in patients with prolonged altered mental status or signs of intoxication, urine screen for drugs of abuse. (See <a href=\"#H3277614\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergency echocardiography should be reserved for those patients with a strongly suspected cardiac etiology due to the presence of red flag findings on history, physical examination, or ECG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F91373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91373 \">table 2</a>). In the absence of these findings, echocardiography is rarely useful. (See <a href=\"#H3277621\" class=\"local\">'Other studies'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the ECG is normal at the initial evaluation, pediatric patients who may require a more extensive cardiac evaluation (ie, additional ECG monitoring, echocardiography, or a stress test) because of other findings on history or physical examination can be referred to a pediatric cardiologist for an outpatient evaluation and determination of whether testing is needed. (See <a href=\"#H3277621\" class=\"local\">'Other studies'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most pediatric patients with syncope, neuroimaging is <strong>not</strong> necessary. Electroencephalogram is appropriate for the uncommon patient with syncope accompanied by prolonged loss of consciousness, seizure activity, and a postictal phase. However, epilepsy is a rare cause of syncope. (See <a href=\"#H3277621\" class=\"local\">'Other studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The proper management of pediatric syncope requires appropriate recognition and treatment of the underlying cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60014\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60014 \">table 1</a>). For children and adolescents with vasovagal (neurocardiogenic) syncope, we suggest the following approach (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>) (see <a href=\"#H3277111\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increase oral intake to approximately 30 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day (eg, 1.5 to 2.4 L in a 50 kg adolescent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Add salty snacks (eg, pretzels, pickles, or crackers)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoid caffeinated beverages</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Teach techniques to prevent venous pooling, including keeping knees slightly bent when standing for a long time, isometric contraction of extremity muscles, toe raises, folding of the arms, and crossing of the legs</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455915021\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Brian Coleman, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-evaluation-of-syncope-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Kapoor WN.
