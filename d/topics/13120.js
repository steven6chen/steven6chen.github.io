The diverse tissues in this anatomic region give rise to a broad spectrum of tumors and tumor-like conditions.</p><p>Cancer of the head and neck is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide and accounts for approximately 63,000 cases and 13,000 deaths annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The most common malignancy is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and its variants. Worldwide, cancers of the head and neck are estimated to occur in 560,000 patients per year and cause 380,000 deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Other important primary neoplasms in the head and neck region include salivary gland tumors and mesenchymal lesions of the soft tissues and paranasal sinuses.</p><p>This section will deal with SCC, including its precursors and variants. Selected benign epithelial proliferations are also clinically relevant and are considered here because of their clinical presentation as tumors and their associated management issues. Major types of salivary gland neoplasms as well as mesenchymal tumors of special clinical significance to this anatomic region are also included. Detailed pathologic discussions of these entities are available in standard references of head and neck pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1063730982\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF SURGICAL SPECIMENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The discussion in this section is focused on squamous cell carcinoma since it is the most common malignant tumor affecting the upper aerodigestive tract. Tumors of salivary gland or mesenchymal origin may be similarly approached. The pathology of thyroid cancer is covered separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atlas-of-thyroid-cytopathology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atlas of thyroid cytopathology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Much attention is given to the histopathologic analysis of squamous carcinoma and its variants, including grading, pattern of infiltration, and margin status. There is no generally accepted and reproducible grading system for squamous carcinoma. The pattern of infiltration at the interface of tumor and underlying connective tissue has been subdivided into as many as five subtypes, ranging from &quot;pushing&quot; to finger-like extensions of variable numbers of cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Although this assessment has potential value, a multitiered system can be subjective, and its application and does not lend itself to reproducibility. Last, margin status, while measurable and of prognostic value, does not affect the final tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging, which depends on tumor size and regional lymph node status. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3420192153\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The<strong> </strong>diagnostic workup may utilize biopsy material or a cytologic specimen (ie, fine needle aspiration [FNA] or cell block).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy &ndash; The conventional procedure for tissue acquisition is biopsy, either incisional or excisional. An excisional biopsy for suspected dysplasia or a potential stage I or II tumor is optimal, since the tissue can be properly oriented and valuable information can be derived from the assessment of tumor infiltration of the underlying connective tissue, as well as the presence of key prognostic factors, such as vascular and perineural invasion. Fixation and tissue processing can then be optimized, both for conventional histology and possible immunohistochemical or molecular studies. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Frozen section is not recommended as a stand-alone procedure for diagnostic purposes only. Frozen section may be appropriate to assess the adequacy of a biopsy sample but only if the surgeon is prepared to remove more tumor, not to be frozen, for definitive diagnosis or therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytology &ndash; The surface of a mucosal lesion may be scraped and directly smeared on a slide. The slide may be air-dried for Giemsa or Diff-Quik staining, or quickly immersed in 90 percent alcohol for Papanicolaou staining. Oral and pharyngeal tumors, clinically the most accessible, are seldom subjected to this diagnostic modality. This approach is not recommended for leukoplakic or erythroleukoplakic lesions, where the clinical consideration is preinvasive dysplasia. Preinvasive lesions require a tissue sample.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1268884020\"><span class=\"h2\">Margins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete excision implies that the surgical margins are free of invasive tumor, although the exact mechanism of how those margins are sampled and analyzed varies. Assessment of tumor involvement at the surgical resection margins is an important component of the pathology report. </p><p>Given the compact and complex anatomy of the head and neck and the potential distortion of anatomic landmarks during a resection, communication between the surgeon and the pathologist is essential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The real-time geographic relationship of the surgeon and the pathologist varies among institutions. To avoid miscommunication, especially over telephone or intercom lines, it may be necessary for the surgeon to accompany the specimen to the gross pathology lab to speak directly with the pathologist. Proper orientation, accurate margin designation (usually by inking), and other points of clinical interest are discussed at that time. If indicated, immediate and additional assessments by frozen section can then be initiated. </p><p>Identification of surgical margins for frozen section analysis can be carried out by the pathologist from the main resected specimen after it has been appropriately inked to conform to the surgeon's designations. Alternatively, the surgical margins can be identified by the surgeon from the resection defect, which is the more popular approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>If the pathologist identifies the margins, the specimen should be inked and cut perpendicular to the long axis of the tumor. Sampling by the surgeon gives rise to a frequent barrage of frozen sections. If the surgeon identifies the margins by defect sampling, the accurate determination of margin distance from tumor is, at best, an estimate and should be so designated by the pathologist on the summary report. &#160;</p><p>Although many studies use 5 mm as an indicator of an adequate margin, this figure may change with the anatomic location of the tumor (eg, oral cavity, pharynx, larynx) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In addition, the distance between invasive tumor and the excised edge is subject to a long list of poorly controlled potential artifacts, such as specimen shrinkage, method of margin assessment, and plane of tumor sectioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. While a surgical excision that cuts across invasive or in situ tumor is undesirable, the definition of a negative or adequate surgical margin has been debated for some time, with implications for the correlation of local recurrence or even long-term survival with margin status.</p><p>More recently, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has formulated a set of guidelines related to margins of resection, and these are used in the recommendations of the College of American Pathologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These recommendations can be summarized as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete resection of the tumor means the inked specimen margins are negative for in situ and invasive tumor.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate margins vary by tumor site.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clear margin is defined as at least 5 mm from invasive tumor.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close margin is defined as less than 5 mm from invasive tumor.</p><p/><p>Head and neck surgeons frequently use intraoperative evaluation (frozen section) in the assessment of surgical margins. The clinical value of using extensive frozen sections for major resections has been infrequently addressed. Nonetheless, the use of frozen section to ensure <span class=\"nowrap\">negative/adequate</span> margins is embedded in modern clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/7,9,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84270693\"><span class=\"h1\">SQUAMOUS CELL CANCER PRECURSORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84270701\"><span class=\"h2\">Leukoplakia, erythroplakia, and leukoerythroplakia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical terms leukoplakia, erythroplakia, and leukoerythroplakia are squamous proliferations manifested as white, red, or speckled mucosal plaques, respectively, and do not denote specific pathologic entities. However, it is helpful to the pathologist to know whether a lesion demonstrates erythroplakic features, since these are more frequently associated with dysplasia or overt malignancy. The diagnosis of dysplasia or invasive carcinoma requires biopsy and microscopic examination.</p><p>While dentists, oral surgeons, and otolaryngologists are aware of potentially suspicious mucosal changes in patients with known carcinogenic exposures, utilizing scrape samples for cytologic study is of unproven efficacy for diagnostic purposes. No screening procedure obviates the need for a diagnostic biopsy of a suspicious lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemoprevention-and-screening-in-oral-dysplasia-and-squamous-cell-head-and-neck-cancer#H1055378701\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemoprevention and screening in oral dysplasia and squamous cell head and neck cancer&quot;, section on 'Screening'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84270709\"><span class=\"h2\">Squamous hyperplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal oral and pharyngeal mucosa is a nonkeratinized surface that originates from a single layer of relatively small basal cells. As these cells mature and ascend toward the mucosal surface, they become larger due to the acquisition of cytoplasm that contains keratin. Squamous hyperplasia is a reactive phenomenon consisting of a thickened squamous epithelium, and includes both acanthosis (increased thickness of the spinous layers) and expansion of the basal cell layer (increase in <span class=\"nowrap\">basal/parabasal</span> cells). </p><p>A localized keratotic surface, often in the form of a visible plaque, is seen clinically as leukoplakia. Squamous hyperplasia can be due to a variety of causes, ranging from ill-fitting dentures to toxic substances, and frequently results in some accompanying inflammation or granulation tissue. Suprabasilar mitotic figures and individual cell keratinization (dyskeratosis) may be present, and make hyperplasia difficult to distinguish from true mild dysplasia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84270716\"><span class=\"h2\">Squamous dysplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Squamous dysplasia is accepted as the precursor of squamous carcinoma. Dysplasia is a premalignant proliferation of squamous epithelium; its severity is graded based upon a loss or dysfunction of cytoplasmic maturation as cells advance from basal to superficial layers. This phenomenon is often referred to as a loss of polarity. </p><p>The assessment of dysplasia in the squamous mucosa of the head and neck uses the well-established paradigm of dysplasia in the uterine cervix. In dysplasia, there is a progressive disorganization and loss of maturation (polarity) of the squamous epithelium as cells move upward from the basal layer to the nonkeratinized surface. Dyskeratosis (out of sequence individual cell keratinization) often accompanies this loss of polarity.</p><p>The pathologic evaluation of oral epithelial dysplasia remains inexact and is not consistently reproducible. The definitions of the World Health Organization (WHO) for grading dysplasia are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild dysplasia: Abnormal architectural and cytological features largely confined to the lower third of the epithelium.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate dysplasia: The dysplastic process extends into the middle third of the epithelium. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe dysplasia: Extension of the process into the upper third of the epithelium.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carcinoma in-situ: Full thickness involvement is present in the absence of invasion. For practical purposes, severe dysplasia and carcinoma in-situ are synonymous. </p><p/><p>Nuclear pleomorphism may be apparent in all grades of dysplasia but is not a conspicuous feature. Mitotic figures, possibly more diagnostically relevant, accompany the progressive grades of dysplasia, moving higher in the epithelium with high-grade abnormalities. A comprehensive analysis of the genetics of oral premalignancy is beyond the scope of this section, but it is reviewed elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The WHO architectural and cytologic criteria are meant to improve interobserver agreement in classifying oral epithelial dysplasia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59087 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/6,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,18</a>]. However, a two-tiered system may be more reproducible. Based upon an initial pilot study, high-risk lesions were defined as those with four or more of the seven WHO architectural features and five or more of the nine cytologic features of high grade dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Low-risk lesions were associated with less than four architectural or less than five cytological changes. In a subsequent retrospective study, in which biopsy specimens were reclassified and compared with known clinical outcomes, this system was able to predict malignant transformation with a sensitivity of 85 percent and a specificity of 80 percent.</p><p>Although dysplasia is regarded as a precancerous condition, precursor lesions in the oral and pharyngeal mucosa do not necessarily follow a linear progression. Dysplasia can regress, while invasive cancer can occur in the absence of surface dysplasia. Furthermore, dysplasia on a biopsy or resection is not necessarily predictive of subsequent malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Comparisons of biopsy specimens with subsequent resection specimens has found that the degree of dysplasia was underestimated in a third of cases and carcinoma was missed in 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84270723\"><span class=\"h1\">SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This section discusses pathologic aspects of conventional squamous cell carcinoma (SCC; ie, &quot;not otherwise specified [NOS]&quot;) as well as some variants with special features that may reflect differences in behavior or prognosis. These include verrucous, basaloid, and spindle cell variants of SCC, as well as nasopharyngeal carcinoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84270730\"><span class=\"h2\">Invasive squamous cell carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Invasive SCC in the head and neck evolves along two major pathways: tumors related to tobacco and alcohol and those associated with human papilloma virus (HPV). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors for head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tobacco and alcohol-related SCCs are associated with a mutated and overexpressed p53 gene, frequently in conjunction with chromosome 7 aneuploidy, and have an increased proliferative index as measured by Ki-67 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (especially high-risk virotypes typified by HPV 16) is responsible for an increasing percentage of SCCs arising in the oropharynx (chiefly represented by the lymphoid-rich areas of the base of tongue and tonsil) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Following direct infection of the squamous mucosa, HPV is integrated into the host genome, inactivates the retinoblastoma gene (Rb), and stops its negative feedback on viral E6 and E7 proteins, which results in overexpression of tumor suppressor protein p16. This protein is easily measured by immunohistochemistry and is used as a surrogate for the presence of HPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus associated head and neck cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virology of human papillomavirus infections and the link to cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Invasive SCC is defined by a tumor that has penetrated into the underlying connective tissue beneath the basement membrane under the basal epithelial layer. This sequence is logically visualized if there is coexistent high-grade surface dysplasia or carcinoma in-situ, since this involvement is by direct extension. However, SCC in the head and neck region may occur without coexistent carcinoma in-situ. The histologic appearance of the invasive tumor may be represented by a broad confluent band (&quot;pushing&quot;) or by irregular tumor nests, cords, or single cells. Frequently a desmoplastic or fibrous host response accompanies the invasion.</p><p>The gross and histologic features of SCC involving the head and neck are similar to those found in squamous carcinomas in other organs. However, the histologic grading of invasive SCC is controversial and there is no system or scoring scheme on which there is general agreement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/13,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,24</a>].</p><p>Keratinization is often deemed the ultimate direction of squamous cytoplasmic differentiation. Keratinization is typically represented by whorls (pearls) of keratin within tumor nests and may be found either focally or more generally in head and neck SCC. By itself, keratinization is not a reliable grading feature, even though in the past grading was based upon resemblance of the tumor to the normal maturation sequence of squamous epithelium.</p><p>At best, grading attempts are inexact, subjective, and not reproducible. The modifiers well- (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F78595\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78595 \">picture 1</a>), moderately- (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F78301\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78301 \">picture 2</a>), or poorly-differentiated carcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63428\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63428 \">picture 3</a>) are used by some pathologists nonetheless. In the absence of histologic keratinization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intercellular bridges, the identification of a tumor as squamous may require immunohistochemical stains, eg, high molecular weight keratin cocktails <span class=\"nowrap\">(CK5/6),</span> p63, or p40.</p><p>Tumors of the oral cavity (lip, mobile tongue, floor of mouth) are frequently keratinizing tumors, while nonkeratinizing or basaloid tumors are more common in the oropharynx. SCC of the larynx is typically a keratinizing neoplasm, often associated with mucosal dysplasia or in situ changes.</p><p>Prognostically, the most important factor is the stage, which is principally determined by tumor size and nodal metastasis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the diagnosis and staging of head and neck cancer&quot;</a>).

The mass effect of tumors originating in this location often obscures or eliminates the surface (dysplastic) changes. This tumor is strongly associated with prior Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Clinical presentation of a cervical metastasis with an occult primary is common.

Outside of endemic areas, this variant has a weak association with EBV. These tumors may be divided into differentiated (resembling nonkeratinizing squamous or transitional cell carcinoma) and undifferentiated carcinoma, but such a division has no clinical significance. They generally induce a marked infiltration of benign T-lymphocytes around and within the tumor, hence the older term &ldquo;lymphoepithelioma&rdquo; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73439\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73439 \">picture 9</a>). </p><p>Nonkeratinizing carcinoma accounts for 75 percent of nasopharyngeal carcinomas in the United States compared with 99 percent in Hong Kong [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is strongly associated with EBV. Nonkeratinizing nasopharyngeal carcinomas of the undifferentiated type (&ldquo;lymphoepithelioma&rdquo;) are histologically distinctive tumors characterized by syncytia of large malignant cells with vesicular nuclei, conspicuous nucleoli, and easily observed mitotic figures. The cytoplasm is amphophilic and cell borders are often indistinct. This high-grade appearance is deceptive since the tumor cells are packed with wavy bundles of keratin tonofilaments ultrastructurally. The cohesive arrangement is due to the numerous intercellular attachments (desmosomes). These features, readily recognized by electron microscopy, correspond to the diffuse and strong reactivity of the tumor cells to a variety of keratin proteins by immunohistochemistry. The background stroma of these tumors is marked by a dense lymphoplasmacellular infiltrate. The relationship of this tumor to EBV is apparent with in-situ hybridization to EBER-1.

Morphologically this is a benign condition, but the clinical course is manifested by multifocality and multiple recurrences, which require excision. Lower respiratory tract involvement often leads to the sequelae of respiratory obstruction (including pneumonia, abscesses, parenchymal lung destruction, and respiratory failure, which together constitute the principal cause of death) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-53</a>]. </p><p>In children and adolescents, RRP is thought to be a result of vertical transmission of HPV during pregnancy or delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The rarity of RRP does not correlate with frequency of HPV infection and associated dysplasias in the female genital tract, and the etiologic role of HPV may be a cofactor along with other environmental or host factors. In adults, RRP may be related to reactivation of a latent infection or a new mucosal exposure.</p><p>Histologically the papillomas consist of benign proliferations of squamous epithelium with HPV associated viropathic changes comparable to those found in the female genital tract. Papillomas commonly exhibit varying degrees of squamous dysplasia throughout the course of disease, though the role of dysplasia in forecasting possible recurrence or malignant change has been controversial.

The prognosis of a carcinoma arising within a pleomorphic adenoma is largely but not entirely dependent upon the extent of invasion. Cases where the carcinoma component was confined within the tumor capsule have not recurred or metastasized, in contrast to the aggressive behavior seen with invasive carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].

Many of these cases subsequently have been reclassified as polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (PLGA). ACC arises in both major and minor salivary glands. The tumor is locally aggressive, with recurrences often arising after many years. </p><p>Three basic growth patterns are commonly seen: tubular, cribriform (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F67445\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67445 \">picture 22</a>), and solid. These patterns are often mixed. The biologic aggressiveness of ACC correlates with the amount of the solid component within the tumor. The solid areas generally contain cells with larger, more pleomorphic nuclei, increased mitotic activity, and often, foci of necrosis. A grading scheme attempts to integrate the varied histologic components: grade 1 tumors are composed entirely of tubules or cribriform areas, while the presence of a solid component defines higher-grade tumors. A 30 percent solid component serves as the breakpoint between grade 2 and 3 tumors.</p><p>In a study of 129 cases, clinical stage, solid growth pattern, and p53 expression were found by multivariate analysis to be the most important prognostic features in head and neck ACC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].

ACC frequently demonstrates bone and perineural invasion. As with other tumors that commonly invade perineural spaces, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), nerve growth factor (NGF) and its receptor, and tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) are commonly expressed in adenoid cystic carcinoma, and may provide the molecular basis underlying its behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-of-head-and-neck-neoplasms/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>].</p><p>Immunoreactivity for c-kit (CD117) may be present in the luminal cells of ACC.

Squamous dysplasia is graded and may progress in a multistep fashion from hyperplasia and dysplasia to in-situ and invasive carcinoma. However, dysplasias regress in some cases. Histopathology is limited in its ability to predict malignant transformation and thus, close clinical follow-up of premalignant lesions is suggested.

Grading of invasive tumors is subjective and not consistently reproducible. The size of the tumor (T), the presence or absence of lymph node metastasis (N), and the presence or absence of distant metastases (M) form the basis of the TNM staging system, which is the major prognostic determinant in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
