KD also occurs rarely in adults. It is typically a self-limited condition, with fever and manifestations of acute inflammation lasting for an average of 12 days without therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, complications such as coronary artery (CA) aneurysms, depressed myocardial contractility and heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and peripheral arterial occlusion may develop and lead to significant morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of KD are discussed in this review. The epidemiology, etiology, treatment, and complications of KD, including cardiac sequelae, are presented separately. Incomplete (atypical) KD and unique features in infants and adults are also reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-epidemiology-and-etiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Epidemiology and etiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-initial-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Initial treatment and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incomplete (atypical) Kawasaki disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of KD reflect widespread inflammation of primarily medium-sized muscular arteries. Diagnosis is based upon evidence of systemic inflammation (eg, fever) in association with signs of mucocutaneous inflammation. The characteristic bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis, erythema of the lips and oral mucosa, rash, extremity changes, and cervical lymphadenopathy typically develop after a brief nonspecific prodrome of respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>] (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Other findings'</a> below). These characteristic clinical signs are the basis for the diagnostic criteria for KD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67711 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Oral mucous membrane findings are seen in approximately 90 percent of cases of KD, polymorphous rash in 70 to 90 percent, extremity changes in 50 to 85 percent, ocular changes in &gt;75 percent, and cervical lymphadenopathy in 25 to 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10-12</a>].</p><p>These findings are often not present at the same time, and there is no typical order of appearance. As an example, some patients have only developed fever and cervical lymphadenopathy by the time of admission (so-called KD with isolated cervical lymphadenopathy, KDiL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In one case series, these patients tended to be older and to have a more severe course, with increased risk of coronary artery (CA) disease and lack of response to intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG). Thus, repeated histories and physical examinations are important both for making a timely diagnosis of KD in children who fail to meet diagnostic criteria, as well as for appropriate consideration of alternative diagnoses. (See <a href=\"#H26262883\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An elevated body temperature is the most consistent manifestation of KD. Fever is minimally responsive to antipyretic agents, and it typically remains above 38.5&ordm;C (101.3&ordm;F) during most of the illness. On the other hand, fever may be intermittent and may be missed by parents who use tympanic, temporal, axillary, or similar temperature measurement methods that are less reliable than oral or rectal methods. Thus, the diagnosis should be considered in all children with prolonged, unexplained fever &ge;5 days but should still be considered in seemingly afebrile children who have other findings consistent with KD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incomplete (atypical) Kawasaki disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Conjunctivitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis is present in more than 90 percent of patients. A predominantly bulbar injection typically begins within days of the onset of fever, and the eyes often have a brilliant erythema, which characteristically spares the limbus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78898\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78898 \">picture 1</a>). Children also are frequently photophobic. In addition, anterior uveitis may develop in up to 70 percent of children with ocular findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>]; therefore, slit-lamp examination may be helpful in ambiguous cases. The presence of uveitis provides further evidence for the diagnosis of KD since it is more commonly seen in KD than in other diseases with similar presentations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uveitis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Mucositis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mucositis often becomes evident as KD progresses. Cracked, red lips (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F59319\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59319 \">picture 2</a>) and a strawberry tongue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68321\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68321 \">picture 3</a>) are characteristic. The latter is a result of sloughing of filiform papillae and denuding of the inflamed glossal tissue. These manifestations of oral mucositis may occur singly, in a very mild form, or not at all. Discrete oral lesions, such as vesicles or ulcers, and tonsillar exudate are suggestive of a disease process other than KD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Rash</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cutaneous manifestations of KD are polymorphous. The rash usually begins during the first few days of illness, typically as perineal erythema and desquamation, followed by macular, morbilliform, or targetoid skin lesions of the trunk and extremities. Vesicular or bullous lesions generally are not observed, but KD may trigger a psoriasiform eruption in children not previously recognized to have psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. Patients may also have redness or crust formation at the site of Bacille Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) inoculation. This finding is more useful for increasing the level of suspicion for KD in countries where BCG vaccine is routinely given. (See <a href=\"#H26262883\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Extremity changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Changes in the extremities are generally the last manifestation to appear. Children develop an indurated edema of the dorsum of their hands and feet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72040\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72040 \">picture 4</a>) and a diffuse erythema of their palms and soles.</p><p>The convalescent phase of KD is often characterized by sheet-like desquamation that begins in the periungual region of the hands and feet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F53452\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53452 \">picture 5</a>) and by linear nail creases (Beau's lines). The prevalence of periungual desquamation in patients with KD has been reported to vary from 68 to 98 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphadenopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical lymphadenopathy is the least consistent feature of KD, absent in as many as one-half to three-quarters of children with the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. When present, lymphadenopathy tends to primarily involve the anterior cervical nodes overlying the sternocleidomastoid muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Often, only a single, large node is palpable, although ultrasound imaging of the neck typically reveals numerous discrete nodes arranged like a bunch of grapes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Diffuse lymphadenopathy or other signs of reticuloendothelial involvement (eg, splenomegaly) should prompt a search for alternative diagnoses. (See <a href=\"#H26263419\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3460119\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiovascular findings are not part of the diagnostic criteria, but they support the diagnosis since most conditions that mimic KD do not involve the heart. Cardiac manifestations during the first week to 10 days of illness may include tachycardia out of proportion to the degree of fever, gallop sounds, and muffled heart tones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. With improved echocardiographic techniques and use of Z-scores for determining CA diameter, approximately 30 percent of patients with KD are found to have CA dilatation at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Frank aneurysms are usually not seen until after day 10 of illness. Severely ill patients, particularly young infants, may develop fusiform aneurysms of the brachial arteries that are easily palpable or visible in the axillae. In addition, young infants may have cold, pale, or cyanotic digits of the hands and feet due to reduced perfusion. Gangrene may, in rare cases, cause loss of fingers or toes during this acute period. The cardiac complications associated with KD are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-complications#H2507753\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Complications&quot;, section on 'Cardiac complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-sequelae-of-kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular sequelae of Kawasaki disease: Clinical features and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2138542523\"><span class=\"h2\">Arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arthritis is not included in the diagnostic criteria but has been reported in 7.5 to 25 percent of patients with KD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The prevalence of arthritis was 7.5 percent in a retrospective Canadian study of 414 consecutive patients diagnosed with KD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The large joints (ie, knee, ankle, and hip) were primarily involved. Oligoarticular involvement (arthritis of four or fewer joints) occurred in 16 patients and polyarticular involvement (arthritis of five or more joints) in 15 patients. With only very rare exceptions, the arthritis is self-limited and nondeforming. Patients with arthritis were more likely to have increased levels of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP] or erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and neutrophils. Otherwise, there were no differences in clinical features, response to therapy, or clinical outcomes between patients with or without arthritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Other findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following nonspecific symptoms commonly occur in children within the first 10 days before diagnosis of KD but are not included in the diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain &ndash; 61 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irritability &ndash; 50 percent (older children with KD may present more with lethargy than irritability)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting alone &ndash; 44 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough or rhinorrhea &ndash; 35 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased intake &ndash; 37 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint pain &ndash; 15 percent</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No laboratory studies are included among the diagnostic criteria for typical KD. However, certain findings may support the diagnosis of KD, particularly in incomplete cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] (see <a href=\"#H26262883\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease#H2509284\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incomplete (atypical) Kawasaki disease&quot;, section on 'Laboratory tests'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic inflammation is characteristic of KD. Typical manifestations include elevation of acute-phase reactants (eg, C-reactive protein [CRP] or erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]), thrombocytosis that generally develops after the seventh day of illness, leukocytosis, and a left-shift (increased immature neutrophils) in the white blood cell (WBC) count.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">CRP elevations resolve well before ESR. However, patients with more severe disease can have persistently high levels of CRP for weeks. Treatment with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) usually raises the ESR, so this lab marker should not be measured after a child receives IVIG. On the other hand, control of inflammation by IVIG accelerates the decrease in CRP, making this a more useful marker of disease activity in a treated child.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ferritin is another acute-phase reactant that is elevated in inflammatory conditions such as KD, usually less than five times the upper limit of normal. Much higher values, typically &gt;5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> are seen in macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), a serious but rare complication of KD. Elevations of that magnitude are essentially diagnostic of MAS in the setting of KD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-complications#H1305931109\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Complications&quot;, section on 'Macrophage activation syndrome'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis#H23116141\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;, section on 'Rheumatologic disorders/MAS'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Lymphocyte numbers typically drop during the acute phase of KD, then rise dramatically during convalescence. Early in the course of disease, a complete blood count with a lymphocytic rather than neutrophilic preponderance is more suggestive of a viral illness. (See <a href=\"#H26263419\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Platelet counts generally rise by the second week of illness and may reach <span class=\"nowrap\">1,000,000/mm<sup>3</sup></span> (reactive thrombocytosis) in the most severe cases. In some studies, the degree of thrombocytosis correlates with the risk of coronary artery (CA) changes in KD. On the other hand, rare children with KD develop thrombocytopenia due to a consumptive coagulopathy. These patients are at significantly increased risk of morbidity and mortality, particularly the development of CA abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kawasaki-disease-complications#H1305931109\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kawasaki disease: Complications&quot;, section on 'Macrophage activation syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with KD often present with a normocytic, normochromic anemia. Hemoglobin concentrations more than two standard deviations below the mean for age are noted in one-half of patients within the first two weeks of illness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101544\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101544 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary microscopy commonly reveals WBCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

The WBCs are not polymorphonuclear leukocytes and therefore are not detected by dipstick tests for leukocyte esterase. Thus, children with suspected KD should have a clean voided or bagged urine specimen collected for microscopic examination in order to detect this characteristic feature.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one retrospective series of 259 patients, 45 percent had at least one abnormal liver function test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In a case-control series, approximately 30 percent of 280 patients with KD had mild-to-moderate elevation of transaminases (eg, serum alanine aminotransferase &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The reason for this transaminitis is unclear. In addition, a minority of children develop obstructive jaundice from hydrops of the gallbladder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CSF may display a mononuclear pleocytosis without hypoglycorrhachia (decreased CSF glucose) or elevation of CSF protein. In a retrospective review, 46 of 520 children with KD underwent lumbar puncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kawasaki-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In this subset of patients, 39 percent had elevated CSF WBC counts.

Thus, no laboratory values are included in the classical diagnostic criteria, but they nonetheless may support a diagnosis of KD in ambiguous cases.

Early in the course, KD is often mistaken for more routine childhood illnesses, such as viral gastroenteritis, viral upper respiratory tract infection, or pneumonia, depending upon the other presenting symptoms, such as vomiting or cough.

However, timely identification is challenging because the diagnosis is based upon nonspecific clinical signs and there is no definitive diagnostic test. Thus, the clinicians in a medical facility with the most experience taking care of patients with KD should be consulted as early in the course of the evaluation of suspected KD as possible.

KD occurs only rarely in adults. It is typically a self-limited condition, with fever and manifestations of acute inflammation lasting for an average of 12 days without therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>KD is characterized by systemic inflammation manifested by fever and mucocutaneous involvement, including bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis, erythema of the lips and oral mucosa, rash, extremity changes, and cervical lymphadenopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67711 \">table 1</a>). These findings are often not present at the same time. Thus, repeated histories and physical examinations are important in making a timely diagnosis of KD in children with fever and signs of mucocutaneous inflammation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No laboratory studies are included among the diagnostic criteria for typical KD. However, the presence of compatible laboratory features strongly supports the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease#H2509284\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incomplete (atypical) Kawasaki disease&quot;, section on 'Laboratory tests'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of KD according to classical criteria requires the presence of fever &ge;5 days, combined with at least four of the other five signs of mucocutaneous inflammation, without any other explanation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67711 \">table 1</a>). Additional clinical and laboratory features are often used to guide diagnosis in children who have fewer than five criteria for KD (incomplete KD). (See <a href=\"#H26262883\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incomplete-atypical-kawasaki-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incomplete (atypical) Kawasaki disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>KD is most commonly confused with infectious exanthems of childhood. The presence of clinical features not commonly found in KD, including exudative conjunctivitis, exudative pharyngitis, discrete intraoral lesions, bullous or vesicular rash, splenomegaly, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> generalized lymphadenopathy, suggest another diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F53802\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53802 \">table 3</a>). Nonetheless, KD is sufficiently pleomorphic that none of these findings can definitively exclude the diagnosis. Children with KD can have concurrent infections, particularly with viruses circulating in the community at the time of their diagnosis.
