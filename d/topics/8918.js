In all these situations, the abnormality of biliary excretion of bilirubin is shared with excretory defect of all or some other organic anions. Inherited syndromes of intrahepatic cholestasis commonly result from mutations in the following genes: <em>SERPINAI</em> (alpha 1- antitrypsin), <em>JAG1</em> (causing Alagille syndrome), <em>ATP8B1</em> (also known as <em>FIC1</em>), <em>ABCB11</em> (bile salt export pump [BSEP]), <em>MDR3</em> (<em>ABCB4</em>), and <em>MRP2</em> (causing Dubin-Johnson syndrome). The genetic basis of Rotor syndrome has not been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Although Dubin-Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome have similar phenotypes (mild, fluctuating elevation of both unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin in plasma), in Dubin-Johnson syndrome biliary excretion of organic anions, except bile acids, is impaired, while Rotor syndrome is a disorder of hepatic storage. Other inherited conditions, like progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis and benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis, cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia as a consequence of reduced bile flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DUBIN-JOHNSON SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1954, Dubin and Johnson [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and Sprinz and Nelson [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] described patients with predominantly conjugated chronic hyperbilirubinemia that was not associated with hemolysis. The disorder occurs in all races and nationalities and both sexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. It is rare except in Sephardic Jews in whom the incidence is approximately 1:3000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dubin-Johnson syndrome is characterized clinically by mild icterus. Otherwise, patients are asymptomatic, although mild constitutional complaints such as vague abdominal pains and weakness can occur. Icterus can be so mild as to be noted only during intercurrent illnesses, pregnancy, or consumption of oral contraceptives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Pruritus is not seen in this condition. Physical examination is usually normal except for the icterus, although hepatosplenomegaly is seen occasionally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine clinical laboratory tests, including the complete blood count, serum albumin, cholesterol, alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and prothrombin time, are normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Fasting and postprandial bile acid levels, which are sensitive indices of liver disease, are normal, reflecting the fact that the genetic abnormality does not affect the transport of most bile acids. Serum bilirubin concentrations are usually between 2 and 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> but may decline to normal levels or be as high as 20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. Approximately 50 percent of the serum bilirubin is conjugated. Of the conjugated bilirubin, a major fraction is bilirubin diglucuronide. In addition, covalently albumin-bound fraction is found in plasma. Bilirubinuria is common.</p><p>Oral cholecystography, using even a double dose of the contrast material is unsuccessful in visualizing the biliary system. Visualization may, however, be possible four to six hours after intravenous administration of Iodipamide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>Grossly, the liver is black [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is histologically normal except for the presence of a dense pigment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67304\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67304 \">picture 1</a>). Electron microscopy reveals that the pigment is contained in the lysosomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy suggests that the pigment is composed of polymers of epinephrine metabolites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Computerized tomography of patients with Dubin-Johnson syndrome shows a significantly higher attenuation as compared with normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Organic anion transport defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uptake of organic anions at the sinusoidal surface of hepatocytes is normal in Dubin-Johnson syndrome, as shown by normal initial plasma clearance of intravenously administered bilirubin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], bromosulfophthalein (BSP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/7,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,14,15</a>], dibromosulfophthalein (DBSP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a> (ICG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], and 125I-labeled rose bengal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, in 90 percent of patients, plasma BSP concentration shows a secondary increase 90 minutes after intravenous administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/6,7,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,16</a>]. The secondary rise reflects regurgitation of glutathione-conjugated BSP from hepatocytes to the plasma. A similar secondary rise is seen after intravenous injection of unconjugated bilirubin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>], but not after injection of substances, such as DBSP, ICG, and 125I-labeled rose bengal, which are not conjugated prior to excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Although the secondary rise is characteristic of Dubin-Johnson syndrome, it is not diagnostic by itself, because it is also seen in hepatobiliary cholestatic disorders.

However, reduced factor VII levels are also found among patients from other communities.

Organic anion transport defects and urinary coproporphyrin excretion patterns are similar to patients with Dubin-Johnson syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]. However, the most widely used model is the TR-rat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-29</a>]. In these rats, biliary excretion of conjugated bilirubin and other organic anions is impaired. The predominant coproporphyrin in urine is coproporphyrin I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Lysosomal accumulation of black pigments in the liver occurs after feeding a diet enriched with amino acids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Breeding studies show an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and suggest that the abnormality of a single gene is responsible for the disease. The Golden lion tamarin monkey, which manifests conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, is another animal model for Dubin-Johnson syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular mechanism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-bile acid organic anions, such as conjugated bilirubin and other glucuronide or glutathione conjugated substances, are transported into the bile canaliculus from the hepatocyte by the multidrug resistance related protein, <em>MRP2</em> (also known as the canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter, cMOAT), which is encoded by the <em>ABCC2</em> gene (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50804\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50804 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/23,31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,31-34</a>].</p><p>The transport is ATP-dependent and is achieved against high concentration gradients. The electrochemical gradient created by the negative intracellular potential of -35 mV also contributes to the transport of bilirubin glucuronides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/22,28,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,28,35</a>] into the bile canaliculus. <em>MRP2</em> is one of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Direct evidence for its involvement in canalicular transport came from the discovery of a frameshift mutation in the gene encoding it in the TR-rat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The human <em>MRP2</em> gene has been localized to chromosome 10q23-q24 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The exon-intron organization has been elucidated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>] and the human cDNA has been isolated based upon homology with rat <em>MRP2</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Several different mutations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60737\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60737 \">figure 2</a>) have been identified in this gene in patients with Dubin-Johnson syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/39-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-44</a>]. Mutations in the ATP-binding region, critical for the functioning of the protein, form a significant proportion of the genetic lesions identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/40,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,42</a>]. One mutation causes impaired maturation and mislocalization of the protein (mutation &quot;h&quot; in the figure) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60737\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60737 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. A mutation at an intronic splice donor site was identified in a patient with Dubin-Johnson syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Autosomal recessive inherence has been confirmed based upon urinary coproporphyrin analysis in families of affected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of Dubin-Johnson syndrome can be made by documenting conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (where at least 50 percent of the total bilirubin is the direct fraction) while the rest of the &quot;liver function profile&quot; (serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time) are normal, together with the characteristic urinary coproporphyrin excretion. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Urinary coproporphyrin excretion'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and differentiation from Dubin-Johnson syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a benign condition and no treatment is required. However, it is important to recognize the condition so as not to confuse it with other hepatobiliary disorders associated with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">ROTOR SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rotor syndrome is a rare disorder, first described in 1948 by Rotor, Manahan, and Florentin. Since then, it has been reported in several nationalities and races.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The syndrome is characterized by chronic conjugated and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia without evidence of hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Although Rotor syndrome had been thought previously to be a variant of Dubin-Johnson syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], the two conditions are now understood to be different entities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In Rotor syndrome, there is a defect in hepatic storage of conjugated bilirubin, which leaks into the plasma, resulting in hyperbilirubinemia. Rotor syndrome is also a benign condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate amino transferase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels are normal. Plasma clearance of bromophthalein sodium (BSP) is delayed, but unlike in Dubin-Johnson syndrome, biphasic peaks are not seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Patients exhibit prolonged retention of intravenously injected unconjugated bilirubin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Transport studies for BSP show a 50 percent reduction in transport maximum of this compound in Rotor syndrome, compared to almost no biliary transport in Dubin-Johnson syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. In contrast to the finding in Dubin-Johnson syndrome, the gallbladder is usually visualized by oral cholecystography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Liver histology is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The absence of dark melanin-like pigments differentiates this disorder from Dubin-Johnson syndrome. However, liver biopsy is not required for the differentiation, which can be done on the basis of urinary coproporphyrin analysis (see below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinary coproporphyrin excretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The total urinary coproporphyrin excretion is increased to 250 to 500 percent of normal and coproporphyrin I constitutes approximately 65 percent of urinary porphyrins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/50,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,53</a>]. In obligate heterozygotes, the pattern of excretion is intermediate between that of patients with Rotor syndrome and controls. With respect to coproporphyrin excretion, Rotor syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition and is distinct from Dubin-Johnson syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. However, the molecular basis of the hepatic storage defect in Rotor syndrome has not been elucidated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H177556382\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular mechanism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilirubin entering the liver sinusoids is extracted efficiently by hepatocytes that are closest to the points of entry, the portal vein and hepatic artery. As canalicular excretion of conjugated bilirubin is rate limiting in bilirubin excretion, this leads to the possibility of saturation of the excretion process. Bilirubin excretory capacity of the liver is increased by transport of conjugated bilirubin back into the sinusoidal blood through the sinusoidal surface of the hepatocytes via the ATP-hydrolysis dependent pump, ABCC3. Bilirubin undergoes re-uptake by hepatocytes downstream to the sinusoidal blood flow via organic anion transporter proteins 1B1 and 1B3 (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3), encoded by <em>SLCO1B1</em> and <em>SLCO1B3</em>, respectively. This re-uptake process results in recruitment of additional hepatocytes downstream to the sinusoidal blood flow, thereby increasing the bilirubin excretory capacity of the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 have functional overlap. Inactivating mutations or deletion of both <em>SLCO1B1</em> and <em>SLCO1B3 </em>disrupts this re-uptake process, resulting in Rotor syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Notably, mutations of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 alone do not cause jaundice. However, these transporters mediate the uptake of many other compounds, including several drugs. Reduced-activity OATP1B1 resulting from polymorphisms can result in life-threatening drug toxicities, such as statin-associated myopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Therefore, great caution should be used in treating patients with Rotor syndrome with drugs that undergo transport by these proteins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis and differentiation from Dubin-Johnson syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dubin-Johnson and Rotor syndrome should be suspected in patients with mild hyperbilirubinemia (with a direct-reacting fraction of approximately 50 percent) in the absence of other abnormalities of standard liver function tests. Normal levels of serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase help to distinguish these conditions from disorders associated with biliary obstruction.</p><p>The urinary coproporphyrin excretion pattern assists in the diagnosis and in the distinction between these disorders. In Dubin-Johnson syndrome, the total urinary coproporphyrin excretion is normal but 80 percent is coproporphyrin I (in normal subjects 75 percent of urinary porphyrins are coproporphyrin III). In contrast, in patients with Rotor syndrome, total urinary coproporphyrins are increased to 250 to 500 percent of normal with approximately 65 percent being coproporphyrin I.</p><p>The plasma BSP clearance can also be used to aid in the distinction between these disorders, although it is no longer available for routine clinical use. In Dubin-Johnson syndrome, plasma BSP clearance shows a characteristic biphasic peak. Retention of the dye is nearly normal 45 minutes after injection, but there is a secondary peak at 90 minutes. In Rotor syndrome, there is increased retention at 45 minutes and no secondary peak is seen.</p><p>Liver biopsy is not necessary for the diagnosis of either condition. However, if a biopsy is performed for other clinical indications, the dense pigmentation of the liver seen in Dubin-Johnson syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67304\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67304 \">picture 1</a>) distinguishes it from Rotor syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In both Dubin-Johnson and Rotor syndromes, serum bilirubin levels may increase during pregnancy, requiring differentiation from cholestasis of pregnancy. The latter is usually associated with pruritus, which is not a feature of Dubin-Johnson or Rotor syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As in Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Rotor syndrome does not require treatment.

However, in approximately 8 percent of children with PFIC II caused by different <em>ABCB11</em> mutations, the disease recurred after liver transplantation, probably as a consequence of the development of high titer antibodies against BSEP and deposition of these antibodies, as well as the complement component protein C4d in liver sinusoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/67-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-70</a>].

MDR3 is thought to replenish the phosphatidylcholine in the outer lipid membrane of the bile canaliculus by translocating it from the inner lipid layer. However, bile salt secretion remains normal. In the absence of phosphatidylcholine translocation, bile acids are thought to damage the canalicular membrane, causing progressive destruction of small bile ducts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>].

In patients with PFIC III, ursodeoxycholic acid may relieve the pruritus associated with the disorder, but severe pruritus (most often associated with PFIC I and II) is often unresponsive to conventional treatments with ursodeoxycholic acid, antihistamines, or rifampicin. In such cases, surgical procedures to interrupt the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids are often successful. This can be done by diverting part of the bile flow to an external fistula, where it is discarded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/84-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-86</a>].

Age at first presentation ranges from infancy to late adulthood.

During the attacks, the patients present with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, malaise, anorexia, pruritus, weight loss, and malabsorption. Laboratory tests reveal biochemical evidence of cholestasis without severe hepatocellular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/97,100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,100,101</a>]. Such episodes last for weeks to months followed by a complete clinical, biochemical, and histologic normalization. In a given patient, recurrent attacks resemble each other in symptoms, signs, and duration, although the severity and frequency of the episodes appear to decrease with age. BRIC has long been thought to be associated with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and cholestasis associated with use of oral contraceptives. In one study, 11 members of kindred of whom three members had been affected by BRIC developed intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, cholestasis associated with oral contraceptives, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p>Liver histology reveals noninflammatory intrahepatic cholestasis without fibrosis, regardless of the number and severity of attacks.

Surprisingly, this relatively benign disorder was also found to be associated with mutations of <em>ATP8B1</em> (FIC <em>I</em>) and <em>ABCB11</em> (BSEP) genes, which are associated with PFIC-1 and PFIC-II respectively.

As an example, a patient with clinical features of BRIC was found to have two different mutations on the two alleles of the <em>ABCB11</em>: A E186G substitution (previously described in a BRIC-2 case) and a V444A substitution (linked to intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy). The compound heterozygosity led to the absence of BSEP in bile canaliculi of hepatocytes. Bile salt excretion was reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p>It has been proposed that BRIC caused by mutations of <em>ATP8B1</em> and <em>ABCB11</em> should be termed BRIC-1 and BRIC-2, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. There are clinical differences between these two subtypes suggesting that it may be appropriate to subclassify BRIC into at least two distinct disorders (BRIC type 1 and 2). Pancreatitis is a known extrahepatic manifestation in BRIC caused by the <em>ATPB1</em> mutations but not in BRIC patients with mutations in <em>ABCB11</em>. Similarly, cholelithiasis has been described in patients with the <em>ABCB11</em> mutation but not in those with the <em>ATP8B1</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-disorders-associated-with-conjugated-hyperbilirubinemia/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no specific treatment for BRIC.
