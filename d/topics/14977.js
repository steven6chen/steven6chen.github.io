The kidneys filter the blood and get rid of excess water and waste in the urine.</p><p>The most common form of kidney cancer in adults is renal cell carcinoma. Renal cell carcinoma usually does not cause obvious symptoms, especially in the early stages. As a result, the cancer may not be discovered until it is advanced.</p><p>Treatment of renal cell carcinoma may include surgery to remove part or all of a kidney. In some people, a medicine is used to slow the growth of the cancer.</p><p>This article discusses the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment options for renal cell carcinoma. More detailed information about renal cell carcinoma is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognostic-factors-in-patients-with-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognostic factors in patients with renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>More detailed information about renal cell carcinoma, written for healthcare providers, is also available by subscription. (See <a href=\"#H1943117\" class=\"local\">'Professional level information'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RENAL CELL CARCINOMA SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with renal cell carcinoma do not have obvious symptoms. This means that renal cell carcinoma is sometimes not found until the cancer is advanced. When symptoms do occur, the most common ones include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood in the urine (hematuria)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the sides of the mid back (the flank)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A palpable mass in the abdomen or side of the back</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling around the left testicle</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss, night sweats, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> unexplained fever</p><p/><p>If you have any of these symptoms, talk to your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RENAL CELL CARCINOMA DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have symptoms of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), your doctor or nurse may order an imaging test, such as an ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan, to look at the kidneys. In many cases, however, the cancer is found when one of these tests is done for another reason and incidentally identifies an abnormal mass or growth in the kidney.</p><p>If you have an ultrasound that shows a growth on your kidney, a CT scan, generally before and after intravenous contrast injection, will be done. The CT scan may also tell if the growth appears cancerous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> has spread outside the kidney (metastasized).</p><p>Unlike other cancers, a biopsy is not always needed to be sure that you have RCC. Instead, the diagnosis may be based upon how the tumor looks on the CT scan. Later, the diagnosis is confirmed when the tumor or entire kidney is removed during surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once RCC is diagnosed, the next step is to determine its stage. Staging is a system used to describe the size, aggressiveness, and spread of a cancer. A cancer's stage helps to guide treatment and can help predict the long-term outlook.</p><p>An RCC's stage is based upon:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The size of the tumor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spread of the cancer to the nearby lymph nodes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of cancer in other organs (liver, lung, bone, etc)</p><p/><p>RCC stages range from stage I, meaning the tumor is smaller than 7 cm (approximately 3 inches) and has not spread outside the kidney, to stage IV, meaning the tumor has spread beyond the outer layers of the kidney or to distant lymph node(s) or other organ(s).</p><p>In general, lower stage cancers are less aggressive or advanced, and less likely to come back after treatment compared with higher stage cancers. Stage I, II, and III RCCs are referred to as localized RCCs, while stage IV is referred to as an advanced or metastatic RCC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">LOCALIZED RENAL CELL CARCINOMA TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preferred treatment for most people with localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is surgery to remove part or all of the kidney and, if necessary, the nearby lymph nodes. </p><p>The decision to remove part or all of the kidney depends upon your cancer's size, where it is located in your kidney, whether there are one or multiple tumors, and how well your kidneys work.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have multiple tumors, or your tumor is large or located centrally within the kidney, complete removal of the kidney may be necessary, especially if your other kidney works normally. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Radical nephrectomy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In other situations or if your kidneys do not work well, removing part of the kidney may be a better option. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Nephron-sparing treatments'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Radical nephrectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radical nephrectomy is the medical term for a surgery that removes the entire kidney and surrounding tissues. Most people can live with only one kidney.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Nephron-sparing treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nephron-sparing treatments are treatments for RCC that do not remove the entire kidney. Normally, the kidneys filter waste out of the blood with tiny structures, known as nephrons. Nephron-sparing treatments allow some of the nephrons in the same kidney to continue working. This treatment is generally preferred if it is feasible, especially if your kidneys do not work well, a situation in which preserving as many nephrons as possible is a priority.</p><p>Nephron-sparing treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove part of the kidney (called partial nephrectomy); this is the more common treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A treatment that destroys the cancer by burning it (called radiofrequency ablation) or freezing it (called cryoablation).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment after surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For people with localized RCC, further treatment is not usually provided after surgery. Further treatment has not been proven to decrease the chance of the cancer returning.</p><p>However, it is important to see your doctor on a regular basis after being treated for cancer to monitor for signs that the cancer has returned. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up after local treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF ADVANCED RENAL CELL CARCINOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For people with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), treatment with a medicine (called medical treatment) may be recommended instead of or along with surgery. Medical treatment may also be recommended if your cancer recurs after surgery.</p><p>Surgery to remove the kidney or areas outside the kidney where the cancer has spread (metastases) may be done before medical treatment. For someone with advanced RCC, surgery does not usually cure the cancer, but it can reduce symptoms or delay systemic medical treatment.</p><p>The most commonly used medical treatments for advanced RCC are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune therapy (also called immunotherapy) &ndash; This is the term for drugs that work with your immune system to stop or slow the growth of cancer cells, including nivolumab and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ipilimumab</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Targeted therapy &ndash; this includes anti-angiogenic therapies, a class of medicines that reduce the blood supply to the tumor, thus slowing or stopping growth of the tumor, as well as other medicines that directly inhibit the growth of the cancer.</p><p/><p>Advanced RCC is hard to cure. When possible, people with advanced RCC are encouraged to enroll in a clinical trial, as optimal use of approved treatments and several promising not-yet-approved agents are still being investigated. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Clinical trials'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3712906332\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471565952\"><span class=\"h3\">Nivolumab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nivolumab (brand name: Opdivo) is a type of drug called an &quot;anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor&quot; that unleashes the body's immune system so it can reject the kidney cancer. Nivolumab is given once every two weeks (by IV) as an outpatient and is continued unless there is evidence of disease progression, complete disappearance of disease, or severe side effects. Nivolumab is often given in combination with another drug, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ipilimumab</a>, particularly in patients who have not received prior treatment for advanced-stage disease. Treatment with nivolumab may decrease the extent of your kidney cancer and help you live longer. Nivolumab can cause the body to develop an immune reaction against its own tissues. This can result in a wide range of side effects, which can be severe or life-threatening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1987044562\"><span class=\"h3\">Ipilimumab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Ipilimumab</a> (brand name: Yervoy) is an &quot;anti-CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitor&quot; that also uses the body's immune system to reject the kidney cancer. Ipilimumab is generally used in combination with nivolumab, although the combination has more side effects compared with nivolumab alone. The combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab was found to be more effective than blood vessel (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] pathway) targeted therapy (see below) in controlling disease in patients with advanced-stage disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Targeted therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Targeted therapies are medicines designed to slow the growth of tumor cells. The medicines are called &quot;targeted&quot; because they work by interfering with a step in the cancer's growth process. Targeted therapies cannot cure the cancer, but they may allow you to live longer and have fewer symptoms. These therapies are an option for people with advanced or metastatic RCC, either as an alternative to or after immunotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiangiogenic-and-molecularly-targeted-therapy-for-advanced-or-metastatic-clear-cell-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiangiogenic and molecularly targeted therapy for advanced or metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One set of these agents targets the VEGF pathway, which partly controls the growth of blood vessels. The blood vessels feeding RCC tumors are particularly dependent on VEGF, so treatment with anti-VEGF therapies can damage tumor blood vessels, and this may slow or stop the tumor from growing for long periods of time. Drugs in this category include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pazopanib (brand name: Votrient)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sunitinib (brand name: Sutent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cabozantinib (brand name: Cabometyx)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Axitinib (brand name: Inlyta)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sorafenib (brand name: Nexavar)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bevacizumab (brand name: Avastin)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lenvatinib (brand name: Lenvima)</p><p/><p>A second target for treatment of RCC involves blocking a specific protein called the mechanistic (or mammalian) target of rapamycin (mTOR). These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Temsirolimus (brand name: Torisel)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Everolimus (brand name: Afinitor)</p><p/><p>Some of these medicines are available as a pill that you take by mouth, while others are given into an IV. These medicines are typically given one at a time rather than in combination. Recently, the combination of lenvatinib and everolimus has been approved, and it may be offered to some patients if initial treatment approaches fail. The most common side effects of mTOR inhibitors include rashes and fatigue, and for VEGF-targeted therapy, they include fatigue and high blood pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP AFTER LOCAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Close follow-up after local treatment (radical nephrectomy or nephron-sparing treatment) is important for anyone with renal cell carcinoma. Follow-up visits allow your doctor to look for signs that the cancer has returned.</p><p>During a follow-up visit, you will have an exam, lab tests, and X-ray tests or computed tomography (CT) scans. Depending upon the stage of your cancer, these tests are recommended every 6 to 12 months for at least five years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL TRIALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progress in treating renal cell carcinoma requires that better treatments be identified through clinical trials, which are conducted all over the world. A clinical trial is a carefully controlled way to study new treatments or new treatment combinations.
