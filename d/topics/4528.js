In the typical patient with untreated AF, the ventricular rate can reach 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> or higher.</p><p>There are two important reasons to prevent a rapid ventricular response in patients with AF:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of hemodynamic instability <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms.

When rate control is chosen, it can usually be accomplished with pharmacologic therapy. However, some AF patients will respond poorly to or be intolerant of rate control medications. Options for such patients include reconsideration of a rhythm control strategy and nonpharmacologic methods to control the ventricular rate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of atrial fibrillation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhythm control versus rate control in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The use of nonpharmacologic therapies to achieve rate control in AF will be reviewed here. Pharmacologic therapies for rate control in AF are discussed separately.

The general discussion of rate control in patients with AF is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Pharmacologic therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Determinants of ventricular rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During AF, electrical activity in the atria can exceed 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span>. The majority of these impulses do not conduct to the ventricles because of the electrical properties of the atrioventricular (AV) node. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-electrocardiogram-in-atrial-fibrillation#H3660456\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The electrocardiogram in atrial fibrillation&quot;, section on 'Ventricular rate'</a>.)</p><p>AV nodal tissue consists of so-called &quot;slow response&quot; fibers. In most myocardial tissue, the initial depolarizing phase of the action potential (phase 0) is mediated by rapid sodium channels. In contrast, in the slow response fibers of the AV node, phase 0 is mediated by an inward calcium current, which uses a kinetically slow channel. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial action potential and action of antiarrhythmic drugs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The relatively slow kinetics of the inward calcium current limits conduction velocity through the AV node, and therefore the ventricular rate during AF. In addition to these intrinsic properties, the AV node is also richly supplied by both components of the autonomic nervous system. AV conduction is enhanced by sympathetic fibers and slowed by parasympathetic fibers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75699\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75699 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In the typical patient with untreated AF, the ventricular rate during the day varies between 90 and 170 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span>. The ventricular rate may be slower (eg, less than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min)</span> in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased vagal tone.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs that affect AV nodal conduction.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AV nodal disease &ndash; A ventricular rate below 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> in the absence of a drug that slows AV conduction suggests AV nodal disease.</p><p/><p>A ventricular rate above 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> suggests one of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catecholamine excess</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parasympathetic withdrawal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperthyroidism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An accessory pathway as occurs in the preexcitation syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrioventricular-reentrant-tachycardia-avrt-associated-with-an-accessory-pathway\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) associated with an accessory pathway&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Adequacy of rate control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several strategies for assessing the adequacy of rate control efforts. With any strategy, however, rate control should be assessed both at rest and with exertion. Rate control goals are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Pharmacologic therapy&quot;, section on 'Rate control goals'</a>.)</p><p>As an alternative to Holter monitoring or the six-minute walk test, the heart rate response to exertion can be assessed during submaximal or maximal exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Our approach varies according to the kind of exercise the patient might do at home. Thus, for young active patients, we recommend either an exercise ECG test or a Holter during exercise. For older or sedentary patients, measuring heart rate after walking briskly around the office or upstairs may provide sufficient information.</p><p>Regardless of the method used to measure heart rate control, the prevention of symptoms during normal activities or exercise is also a goal of therapy. It is important to consider that symptoms may be due to either inadequate rate control or relative bradycardia (eg, in patients with tachy-brady syndrome). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sick sinus syndrome: Epidemiology, etiology, and natural history&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">AV NODAL ABLATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common nonpharmacologic method of rate control in atrial fibrillation (AF) is catheter-based radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the atrioventricular (AV) node <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the His bundle. Because of the invasive nature of the procedure and the requirement for permanent pacemaker implantation, this treatment is reserved for patients in whom pharmacologic rate control therapy is either unsuccessful or not tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Patients who are candidates for this therapy include those with tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy despite pharmacologic efforts at rate control and intolerable symptoms despite aggressive attempts at pharmacologic therapy (in some cases, much of the symptom burden is due to medications rather than AF itself).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RFA usually produces complete AV block; as a result, patients require implantation of a permanent pacing device to adequately control the ventricular rate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74286%7ECARD%2F67363\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef74286 graphicRef67363 \">waveform 1A-B</a>).</p><p>The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated by the following reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the 1998 NASPE Prospective Catheter Ablation Registry, AV nodal ablation was acutely successful in 97.4 percent of 646 patients, although 3.5 percent had recurrence of AV conduction during follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report from the prospective Ablate and Pace trial, the procedure was successful in all but one of 156 patients who underwent RFA of the AV node [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Persistent complete heart block was present in 96 percent; 33 percent of patients had no escape rhythm, while 35 percent had an escape rhythm with an escape rate &lt;40 beats per minute.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcomes and quality of life</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcomes and quality of life are significantly improved in patients with poorly controlled AF who undergo AV nodal ablation and permanent pacemaker implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. As an example, in a series of 107 such patients, ablative treatment was associated with significant reductions in [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physician visits (5 versus 10 prior to ablation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospital admissions (0.17 versus 2.8 prior to ablation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Episodes of heart failure (HF) (8 versus 18 prior to ablation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiarrhythmic drug trials</p><p/><p>Further support for the benefits of this approach come from a meta-analysis of 21 studies involving 1181 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This report noted significant improvement in all 19 outcome measures evaluated, including quality of life, ventricular function, exercise duration, and health care use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. While such benefits are often due to improved left ventricular (LV) systolic function, improvement in some patients occurs independent of changes in LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and probably results from the slower and more regular heart rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Although AV nodal ablation with implantation of a permanent pacemaker improves symptoms and quality of life, it does not have either a positive or negative impact on overall survival, as illustrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 350 patients from the Mayo Clinic, among patients without other significant cardiac disease (eg, a history of myocardial infarction or HF, or a requirement for cardiac drug therapy), three-year survival both after ablation and with pharmacologic therapy for rate control was the same as the expected survival in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The meta-analysis discussed above found that the calculated one-year total and sudden death mortality rates after ablation and pacing therapy were comparable to those seen with medical therapy (6.3 and 2 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Pacemaker selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following AV nodal ablation, patients are pacemaker dependent, therefore a functioning pacemaker must be in place prior to the ablation procedure.

After AV nodal ablation, the patient's ventricular rate will not naturally respond to increased demand, a device with rate-adaptive capabilities is used (ie, VVIR pacing). Virtually all contemporary pacemakers have rate-adaptive capabilities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of cardiac pacing: Nomenclature and selection&quot;, section on 'Rate responsiveness'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Dual chamber pacemaker</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with paroxysmal AF, dual chamber pacemakers are preferred because they maintain AV synchrony during periods of sinus rhythm (eg, DDDR pacing).

Virtually all contemporary pacemakers have this ability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of cardiac pacing: Nomenclature and selection&quot;, section on 'Mode switching'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, two randomized trials demonstrated that dual chamber pacemakers with mode switching capabilities improve symptoms and quality of life compared to single chamber pacemakers or dual chamber pacemakers without mode switching capability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Many patients who undergo AV node ablation with pacemaker implantation for paroxysmal AF eventually progress to chronic AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although dual chamber pacing has not been shown to prevent this progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], we favor dual chamber pacing in patients with paroxysmal AF because of the clinical benefits of physiologic pacing.

However, RV pacing causes the RV to contract before the LV (interventricular dyssynchrony), which may impair LV systolic function, reduce functional status, and increase mortality. In patients with significant dyssynchrony due to intrinsic conduction disease or pacing, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) can improve ventricular synchrony. Use of CRT in patients with AF with or without AV nodal ablation is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac resynchronization therapy in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is a trend towards using CRT in many patients who undergo AV nodal ablation. If the implant and ablation are to be done concurrently, we use CRT with an atrial lead if paroxysmal and no atrial lead if <span class=\"nowrap\">persistent/permanent</span>. In addition to providing CRT, two ventricular leads mitigate the unlikely but potentially disastrous effects of RV lead dislodgment and loss of RV capture. If, however, RV lead dislodgement results in oversensing and inhibition of pacing, the additional left ventricular pacing lead will not prevent asystole. If the patient has a pre-existing non-CRT device and is undergoing AV nodal ablation, we will usually see how they do with unopposed RV pacing, unless LV function is poor and systolic heart failure has already been an issue.</p><p>The relative efficacy of CRT with AV node ablation for rate control and pulmonary vein isolation for rhythm control in patients with HF is discussed separately.

Thus, patients with an ICD who require an AV nodal ablation procedure can often be managed without changing the device. In some cases, however, patients who did not require frequent pacing prior to the ablation will benefit from an upgrade to a dual chamber <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CRT device as they become pacemaker dependent following the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Postablation risk of VF and pacing rates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although rare, the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) appear to be elevated in the period following AV nodal ablation. In a review of 334 patients who underwent RFA of the AV node, nine (2.7 percent) experienced SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The incidence of VF was 6 percent in the first 100 patients in whom the postablation chronic pacing rate was &le;70 beats per minute. In the next 135 patients, however, a pacing rate of 90 was used for the first three months after the ablation and there were no episodes of VF.</p><p>Pacing at a rate of 90 beats per minute decreases sympathetic activity, which may contribute to the reduction in VF or SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Need for anticoagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While AV nodal ablation results in adequate heart rate control, it does not stop the atria from fibrillating.

As a result, there is a need for long-term anticoagulation similar to that in patients with chronic AF whose heart rate control is achieved pharmacologically.

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) applied to a section of the AV node (eg, the slow pathway) can reduce the number of impulses that successfully reach the infranodal conduction system and the ventricles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy/abstract/18-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-24</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac resynchronization therapy'</a> above.) A potential alternative to CRT is the positioning of a single pacing lead near the His bundle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56944\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56944 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>A pacing lead near the His bundle will activate the native conduction system, resulting in less dyssynchrony and a more normal QRS complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78017\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef78017 \">waveform 2</a>). It is technically difficult to place a conventional pacing lead in a position that results in capture of the His bundle at a reasonable pacing output because the His-bundle is insulated from the endocardium. Newer, small caliber, screw-in pacing leads that are delivered using a guiding sheath rather than a stylet may improve the ability to accomplish permanent para-Hisian capture.</p><p>The value of this approach was evaluated in a crossover trial of 16 patients who underwent AV nodal ablation and permanent pacemaker placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. All patients had one pacing lead placed in the RV apex and a second lead high on the RV septum, where para-Hisian pacing was confirmed. The patients were randomly assigned to para-Hisian pacing or apical pacing for six months, then crossed over to the other pacing mode for an additional six months.</p><p>The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During para-Hisian pacing, the average QRS duration was 121 msec, compared to 88 msec at baseline and 179 msec with RV apical pacing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mean New York Heart Association functional class was better with para-Hisian pacing (1.8) compared to either baseline or with RV apical pacing (2.3 and 2.5, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mitral regurgitation and six-minute walk test results were both better with para-Hisian pacing compared to baseline or RV apical pacing.</p><p/><p>Para-Hisian pacing is technically difficult to accomplish.

Lead dislodgement would have serious complications in this setting due to complete heart block after ablation of the AV node.</p><p>Further studies in larger populations are necessary to clarify both the clinical benefits and safety of this approach. In addition, given the risks of lead dislodgement, the safety and efficacy of para-Hisian pacing should be compared against biventricular pacing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Low atrial isolation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Instead of creating AV block by ablation of the AV node or His bundle, it is theoretically possible to isolate the AV node by creating an ablation line in the lower right atrium, from the tricuspid annulus to the coronary sinus and then to the interatrial septum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53224\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53224 \">figure 2</a>). If successful, the isolated lower segment of the atrium will be electrically independent from the rest of the atria.</p><p>In a patient with AF, such an ablation line would have the following effects:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AV block, due to isolation of the AV node and a small region of atrial tissue from the rest of the atria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Creation of an area of low atrial tissue, electrically isolated from the fibrillating atria, that may be paced by a lead placed within that area.</p><p/><p>In theory, pacing from a lead positioned in this isolated atrial region would result in conduction through the AV node and the His-Purkinje system, producing a normal QRS complex and avoiding the dyssynchrony associated with RV apical pacing. Such an approach has several potential advantages over para-Hisian pacing (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Para-Hisian pacing'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lead placement may be easier and is likely to be more stable.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient is more likely to have a stable escape rhythm, due to preservation of the AV node and His-Purkinje system.</p><p/><p>This approach has been tested in an isolated swine heart model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In a series of five hearts, electrical isolation was successfully achieved, and pacing formed within the isolated segment resulted in normal AV conduction without direct capture of the ventricles.</p><p>This approach is entirely investigational. Published experience is limited to this small series of animal hearts, and substantial additional study will be necessary before this procedure can be considered in clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventricular rate regularization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular rate regularization, or ventricular rate stabilization, is a pacemaker mode that can attenuate the rate and irregularity of the ventricular response during AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The ventricle is paced at a variable rate at or near the mean native rate. This causes concealed retrograde conduction into the AV node, which makes it refractory to subsequent anterograde impulses from the atria. This tends to reduce the number of short RR intervals, which may improve symptoms by making the ventricular rate slower and more regular during AF. A potential advantage of this approach is that no catheter ablation of the AV junction is performed. However, this technique may be less effective at controlling AF during physical activity than at rest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Gene therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A novel approach to modify the AV node and produce rate control is gene therapy. This was examined in an animal study in which the heart was infected with recombinant adenovirus encoding the G-alpha(i2) subunit, an inhibitory component of the beta adrenergic signaling pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-nonpharmacologic-therapy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The overexpression of G-alpha(i2) mimicked the effect of beta blockers, suppressing AV nodal conduction and slowing the heart rate during AF, without producing complete heart block.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3101897252\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

These recommendations apply to patients with AF in whom a rate control strategy has been chosen (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rhythm-control-versus-rate-control-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rhythm control versus rate control in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF with a rapid ventricular response, we recommend pharmacologic therapy to control the ventricular rate as an initial approach (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Pharmacologic therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with chronic or paroxysmal AF with a rapid ventricular response who do not respond to or are intolerant of pharmacologic therapy, we suggest atrioventricular (AV) nodal ablation in association with implantation of a permanent pacemaker (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'AV nodal ablation'</a> above.)<br/><br/>For patients who undergo AV nodal ablation, the appropriate type of pacemaker depends upon the clinical scenario. A single chamber ventricular pacemaker with rate adaptive capability is appropriate for patients with chronic AF (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Single chamber ventricular pacemaker'</a> above), and a dual chamber pacemaker with both mode switching and rate adaptive capabilities is appropriate for patients with paroxysmal AF.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac resynchronization therapy in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>In addition, some patients undergoing AV nodal ablation and pacemaker implantation may benefit from implantation of an internal cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for standard criteria related to primary or secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. All of the pacing modalities discussed above (ie, ventricular, dual chamber, and CRT) can be accomplished with devices that include ICD capabilities.
