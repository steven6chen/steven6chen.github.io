A full understanding of the potential consequences associated with cranial irradiation is needed both to manage potential complications and to properly counsel patients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> families prior to treatment.</p><p>The primary factors influencing the likelihood of developing complications include the volume of normal brain tissue treated, the total radiation dose, and the fractionation schedule. The likelihood of brain toxicity also increases in the young (ie, &lt;5 years old) and in older adults and with use of concurrent or sequential chemotherapy. Poorly characterized genetic factors may also make certain individuals more susceptible to otherwise safe doses of radiation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation#H4143597\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed complications of cranial irradiation&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>The complications of radiation therapy are usually divided into acute effects that can occur during radiation or up to six weeks afterwards, early-delayed effects that appear up to six months after radiation, and late effects that can develop six months or more after the completion of radiation. Unlike acute and early-delayed reactions that are usually reversible, late reactions are generally irreversible.</p><p>The acute complications of both standard fractionated cranial irradiation and stereotactic radiosurgery will be reviewed here. The late complications of cranial irradiation and complications of spinal cord and peripheral nerve irradiation are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed complications of cranial irradiation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of spinal cord irradiation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brachial-plexus-syndromes#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brachial plexus syndromes&quot;, section on 'Neoplastic and radiation-induced brachial plexopathy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbosacral plexus syndromes&quot;, section on 'Radiation plexopathy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4148783\"><span class=\"h1\">STANDARD FRACTIONATED RADIATION THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute side effects occurring during standard fractionated brain radiation therapy (RT) using contemporary techniques are typically mild and manageable with basic supportive care. Some of the more common and uncommon toxicities are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Common acute reactions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18422696\"><span class=\"h3\">Fatigue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatigue is one of the most common side effects of cranial irradiation. Up to 90 percent of patients undergoing partial brain radiation for glioblastoma experience at least grade 1 symptoms (disturbance with some tiredness, but activity not curtailed), and approximately half experience mild to moderate symptoms (decreased activity and increased tiredness, sleeping much of the day, most activities curtailed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Severe somnolence is rare. </p><p>Symptoms typically begin by two weeks from the start of RT, peak at the end of the treatment course or within one to two weeks after treatment completion, and then slowly resolve over the next several months.</p><p>There are limited and conflicting data on the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> during RT to counteract fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a double-blind trial that was terminated prematurely, 68 patients with primary or metastatic brain tumors were randomly assigned to methylphenidate or placebo during RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Eight weeks after completion of RT, there was no difference in fatigue or cognition compared with placebo.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1730191218\"><span class=\"h3\">Loss of appetite</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anorexia is a common symptom with cranial irradiation, occurring in more than half of patients undergoing fractionated cranial RT. Patients typically feel well but have less desire to eat. Most people can still eat when needed but simply do not find food as appealing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation dermatitis and alopecia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total or partial alopecia is extremely common after cranial irradiation and may be permanent with higher radiation total doses. Alopecia occurs only where the radiation beams traverse the scalp, so patients receiving partial brain irradiation may develop patchy alopecia. The severity and permanence of alopecia is directly related to dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Radiation dermatitis is usually mild and may be treated with soothing moisturizing ointments. Areas of skin receiving particularly high doses may demonstrate dry or moist desquamation that requires more intensive bacteriostatic topical treatments. Otitis externa is common if the ear is within the radiation treatment field.</p><p>In patients who have recently begun <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> anticonvulsant therapy, an unusually severe skin reaction or one that extends beyond the RT fields might be the first sign of a developing Stevens-Johnson syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Han Chinese are particularly susceptible, related to HLA-A*3101 and HLA-B*1502 genotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiseizure-drugs-mechanism-of-action-pharmacology-and-adverse-effects#H30597917\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiseizure drugs: Mechanism of action, pharmacology, and adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Role of HLA testing'</a>). A review of erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis in patients undergoing RT found that of 61 patients receiving antiseizure medications during radiotherapy, 48 were for prophylaxis rather than seizure treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], an indication that is generally discouraged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In patients who develop rash, the antiseizure drug should be stopped immediately. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3469379257\"><span class=\"h3\">Headaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild headaches during any part of cranial irradiation may occur and are often mild enough or transient enough that patients do not require medication. For headaches that are more troublesome, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> is typically adequate to resolve the symptom.</p><p>Headaches may also be due to mass effect from tumor, and this etiology is important to differentiate as the management is different. Concomitant progression of neurologic deficits and new or worsening somnolence, when seen with worsening headaches, may signal increased peritumoral edema <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tumor progression. Glucocorticoids to reduce cerebral pressure are the primary approach when cerebral edema and tumor mass effect are suspected, rather than pain medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of vasogenic edema in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3513471976\"><span class=\"h3\">Nausea and vomiting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nausea and vomiting may occur occasionally as a side effect of cranial irradiation. This is far less common than simple loss of appetite. Antiemetics or corticosteroids are used to prevent or mitigate symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiotherapy-induced-nausea-and-vomiting-prophylaxis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting: Prophylaxis and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1474095128\"><span class=\"h3\">Worsening of preexisting neurologic symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Worsening of symptoms related to the tumor or indication for cranial irradiation can initially worsen with RT. This is thought to be related to reactive swelling that mimics tumor growth and causes worsening or recurrence of symptoms. </p><p>Patients with recognized significant pretreatment cerebral edema should begin oral or parenteral glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> 8 to 16 mg daily) prior to initiating radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Maintaining the dose for the first two weeks of RT can prevent clinical deterioration due to transiently worsened peritumoral edema. Any taper during RT should be gradual, and worsening of symptoms may require a short-term increase until RT has been completed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-vasogenic-edema-in-patients-with-primary-and-metastatic-brain-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of vasogenic edema in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4148944\"><span class=\"h2\">Other acute reactions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4149274\"><span class=\"h3\">Hearing problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serous otitis media may occur during RT, resulting in a conductive hearing loss. This typically resolves within a few weeks of RT completion but persistence of symptoms may occasionally require myringotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4149292\"><span class=\"h3\">Parotitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute parotitis and symptomatic or asymptomatic hyperamylasemia is an uncommon complication of some cranial irradiation, most commonly with whole brain RT (WBRT); it occurs when the edge of the radiation portal incidentally irradiates the parotid gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The acute symptoms include fever, pain, swelling, and tenderness. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or glucocorticoids are typically used to treat parotitis related to radiation associated with prompt response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2379040227\"><span class=\"h2\">Uncommon acute reactions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4149188\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute encephalopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute encephalopathy may occur when radiation fractions &gt;3 Gy are administered to a large brain volume, particularly in patients with elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Symptoms include severe headache, nausea, drowsiness, and focal neurologic deficits and fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]; in extremely rare cases, death may occur due to cerebral herniation. This effect is thought to be due to disruption of the blood-brain barrier leading to cerebral edema. With a better understanding of the relationship between dose, schedule, and toxicity, acute encephalopathy is rare with modern treatment techniques. WBRT is generally administered in fractions of 3 Gy or fewer; with this schedule the risk of severe acute encephalopathy is negligible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Early-delayed reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examples of early-delayed reactions to cranial irradiation include the following:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2883505002\"><span class=\"h3\">Persistent fatigue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although variable, many patients notice persistence of mild fatigue over the course of weeks or months after RT completion. For some patients, reduced stamina is more prominent than fatigue. Pacing daily activities is the best approach to managing lingering tiredness after RT. This usually resolves as more time elapses from completion of RT. </p><p>Both fatigue and daytime sleepiness can be multifactorial, and other reversible causes should also be evaluated and treated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-fatigue\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with fatigue&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-excessive-daytime-sleepiness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4149692\"><span class=\"h3\">Transient focal neurologic symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients undergo a delayed transient worsening of symptoms that can suggest tumor progression, with headache <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrence of pretreatment neurologic symptoms and signs. The likely etiology is a combination of tumor response and peritumoral edema. </p><p>Reversible defects in memory also occur and do not necessarily predict long-term impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In a prospective study of 10 patients with low-grade tumors treated with limited field radiation in doses from 46 to 63 Gy, a transient decline in verbal long-term memory was observed 1.5 months after completion of RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This deficit was transient, however, and patients had returned to baseline by one year.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Pseudoprogression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to well-defined clinical syndromes, the routine use of cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has led to the identification of an increase in or reappearance of MRI contrast enhancement weeks to months after completion of RT; this is a transient abnormality but can be hard to distinguish from tumor progression. Patients are often asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic.</p><p>This phenomenon is most common in the first several months after concurrent radiation and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> in patients being treated for high-grade glioma. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-recurrent-high-grade-gliomas#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of recurrent high-grade gliomas&quot;, section on 'Early progression versus pseudoprogression'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1371259640\"><span class=\"h2\">Late effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Late effects are persistent or new symptoms beyond six months from RT completion. These include radiation necrosis, neurocognitive deficits, cerebrovascular effects, neuroendocrine dysfunction, and secondary tumor formation. These and other delayed complications are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed complications of cranial irradiation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4148930\"><span class=\"h1\">STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) involves the administration of a single or very limited number of high doses of ionizing radiation to a small, well-demarcated benign or malignant tumor or vascular malformation within the brain parenchyma, adjacent meninges, or base of skull region. The complications of SRS differ from those of conventional fractionated cranial irradiation because SRS is restricted to a small target volume and it utilizes a much higher dose in a single fraction.</p><p>The initial evaluation of the acute toxicity of SRS was derived from a dose escalation study conducted by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) in 156 patients with primary (36 percent) or recurrent metastatic brain tumors (64 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In this population, the maximum tolerated doses of single-fraction SRS were established as 24 Gy, 18 Gy, and 15 Gy for tumors &le;20 mm, 21 to 30 mm, and 31 to 40 mm in maximum diameter, respectively. At these dose levels, the rates of acute grade 3 to 5 central nervous system (CNS) toxicity ranged from 0 to 17 percent in the three groups, with the higher rates in patients with larger tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Long-term toxicities for these treatment schedules are not well characterized and thus should be judiciously used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4149558\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe acute reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subsequent experience based upon contemporary tumor volume and dose recommendations suggests that severe acute reactions are rare. As an example, in one series that included 835 consecutive patients undergoing SRS, 18 had a neurologic event within seven days of treatment (eg, new focal deficit or seizure) and three died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>In addition to dose, the volume, location of the treated lesion, prior irradiation, and any concurrent systemic therapies including chemotherapy, targeted agents, and immune therapies may affect the incidence of post-SRS seizures. In a small series, seizures following radiotherapy were more common in patients whose lesions were located in the motor cortex rather than elsewhere in the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4149564\"><span class=\"h2\">Less common acute reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less severe neurologic symptoms following SRS are thought to be due to transient swelling that begins 12 to 48 hours after therapy. </p><p>The spectrum of immediate side effects is illustrated by a study of 78 adults with a variety of intracranial lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Within two weeks after SRS, approximately one-third developed mild nausea, dizziness or vertigo, seizures, or new headache. However, only two patients required hospitalization, including one with seizures and one with a worsening neurologic deficit. Higher radiation therapy (RT) doses were associated with a significantly increased incidence of immediate side effects.</p><p>Acute toxicity generally is not predictive of the development of late toxicity. If a specific toxicity is anticipated, as with treatment near the area postrema (nausea center) in the brainstem, a short course of glucocorticoids is recommended around the time of radiosurgery. This generally eliminates the acute toxicity.</p><p>While many patients will do well without prophylactic treatment, many clinicians routinely prescribe a short course of glucocorticoids before <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> after radiosurgery unless there is a contraindication. The intent is to reduce the risk of headache or other symptoms that might occur as a result of transient post-radiosurgery edema in the treated volume. Matters of optimal dose and patient selection for glucocorticoids have not been addressed in formal clinical trials. Numerous common side effects of glucocorticoids should be considered prior to use, including but not limited to insomnia, hyperactivity, increased appetite, weight gain, and hyperglycemia. Over time, there can be significant weight gain, ease of bruising, and depression of the immune system. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>In addition to its potential neurotoxicity, SRS involves immobilization of the patient's head in a rigid frame during treatment. The rigid head frame commonly used to immobilize patients is tightly fixed to the skull with pins that penetrate the skin. As a result, temporary discomfort and self-limited bruising at the pin placement sites can occur immediately following the procedure. Frameless positioning systems have been developed and could eliminate this problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed.
