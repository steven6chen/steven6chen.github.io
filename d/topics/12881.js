class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The proposed model for pathogenesis of PANDAS suggests that GAS pharyngitis and possibly skin infection in a susceptible host causes an abnormal immune response with resultant central nervous system manifestations. If this hypothesis is correct, there might be a role for prophylactic antibiotics <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immune modulating therapies in the prevention and treatment of PANDAS. However, the hypothesis is as yet unproven.</p><p>The model for PANDAS pathogenesis is based upon the clinical similarities between Sydenham chorea and PANDAS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pandas-pediatric-autoimmune-neuropsychiatric-disorder-associated-with-group-a-streptococci/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The pathogenesis of Sydenham chorea and acute rheumatic fever are incompletely understood. However, preceding GAS pharyngitis and an abnormal immune response (in which antibodies directed against GAS antigens cross-react with host antigens in brain and other tissues) are widely accepted as important components. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Molecular mimicry'</a>.)</p><p>The autoimmune complications of GAS infections are caused by an atypical immune response to antigens of GAS bacteria that cross-react with self tissues. Children between the ages of 5 and 12 years are more susceptible to autoimmune complications because they have more frequent exposure and typically respond to GAS (and other infections) with higher quantities of antibodies than older adolescents and adults. The more controlled response in older adolescents and adults may be related to immune mechanisms that dampen proinflammatory processes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Association with GAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The association between neuropsychiatric symptoms and GAS infection was evaluated in a case-control study from a large health maintenance organization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pandas-pediatric-autoimmune-neuropsychiatric-disorder-associated-with-group-a-streptococci/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The investigators identified 144 patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette syndrome, or a tic disorder (in a population of approximately 75,000 children) and matched them with one to five control subjects. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cases were more likely than controls to have had a GAS infection in the three months before onset of neurologic disease (odds ratio [OR] 2.22, 95% CI 1.05-4.69)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cases were more likely than controls to have had multiple GAS infections during the 12 months before onset of neurologic disease (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.77-8.96)</p><p/><p>Prospective studies have confirmed that GAS is associated with the onset or exacerbation of OCD or tic disorder in at least some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pandas-pediatric-autoimmune-neuropsychiatric-disorder-associated-with-group-a-streptococci/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. However, the high background rates of GAS infection, GAS carriage, and <span class=\"nowrap\">OCD/tic</span> disorders in prepubertal children make it difficult to establish causality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pandas-pediatric-autoimmune-neuropsychiatric-disorder-associated-with-group-a-streptococci/abstract/12,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,15</a>].
