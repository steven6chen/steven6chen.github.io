The identification of such habits and assessment of immediate and long-term effects on the teeth and orofacial development should be made as early as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. After infancy, persistent oral habits have little effect on health but can affect facial growth, oral function, the occlusal relationship, and facial esthetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The short- and long-term effects of oral habits are reviewed here. Preventive dental care and counseling for infants and young children are discussed separately.

It is a self-soothing behavior that occurs in 70 to 90 percent of infants in various populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. The frequency of sucking on digits or pacifiers decreases with increasing age; by the age of four to five years, nonnutritive sucking usually is replaced by other coping mechanisms, and the prevalence decreases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Children who use a pacifier are less likely to suck on their thumb or fingers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Compared with pacifier sucking, digit sucking is more likely to persist into the fourth or fifth year of life, when it may become problematic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. If it persists into the period of permanent tooth eruption, nonnutritive sucking may contribute to the development of malocclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Pacifier use does not appear to be related to an increased risk of development of early childhood caries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15700700\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonnutritive sucking habits may be associated with increased prevalence of malocclusion in the primary dentition and mixed dentition, and increased risk of trauma to the upper front teeth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>].</p><p>In addition to the dental effects of nonnutritive sucking, pacifier use has been associated with numerous other health effects, including increased risk of development of otitis media, early cessation of breastfeeding, and possible decreased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). These effects are less clearly associated with digit sucking. A cause-and-effect relationship for these associations has not been established, and in some situations reverse causality may play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

It is described in several retrospective studies, many of which used questionnaires to assess sucking behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/16,17,23-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,23-28</a>]. The association is consistent, although its strength varies depending upon the study. The risk of malocclusion increases directly with frequency, duration, and intensity of sucking habit and is not eliminated by the use of &quot;orthodontic&quot; pacifiers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/3,17,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17,26</a>].</p><p>The following types of malocclusion in the primary dentition are associated with sucking habits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/3,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open bite (the upper and lower anterior teeth do not overlap)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior crossbite (the upper posterior teeth bite inside the lower posterior teeth on one or both sides)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive overjet (excessive horizontal overlap of the upper relative to the lower front teeth); in children with digit habits, it may be exacerbated by lower incisors that are positioned toward the tongue (lingually positioned)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class II relationship (the upper jaw protrudes too far in front of the lower jaw)</p><p/><p>A meta-analysis verified these findings for the primary dentition but noted that posterior crossbite was more strongly associated with pacifier habits than with digit habits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This analysis also confirmed that longer duration of nonnutritive sucking habits was associated with higher risk for developing malocclusion.</p><p>Few studies have evaluated whether habit-related malocclusion of the primary dentition persists into the permanent dentition. In one longitudinal study of 116 Australian children two to eight years of age, persistent finger sucking was related to increased overjet and a proportion of Class II malocclusions; dental arch width was not affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. In contrast, pacifier use was associated with decreased arch width that typically resolved within two to three years after pacifier use was discontinued. Increased prevalence of posterior crossbite among children with nonnutritive sucking habits was not noted in this study.</p><p>A cross-sectional study of 320 nine-year-old children evaluated the relationship between various patterns of digit and pacifier sucking and facial growth and occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Finger-sucking was associated with greater overjet, decreased maxillary arch width, and increased maxillary arch length. The effects of pacifier use were more pronounced when pacifier use was continued beyond the age of four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The permanent dentition of a subset of the cohort was examined when they reached 16 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Skeletal changes, including anterior rotation of the nasal and mandibular planes, were found more commonly among those with a previous sucking habit than in those without. In addition, Class II malocclusions and traumatic injuries to the maxillary anterior teeth were found more commonly among those with a history of finger sucking than those who used a pacifier or did not have a sucking habit.</p><p>In a study of children undergoing orthodontic treatment for excessive overjet, there was no correlation between severity of overjet and the prevalence of trauma to the incisors (approximately 25 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Children with a history of trauma were likely to report additional trauma. Most of the injuries were mild and involved the permanent central incisors.</p><p>Another study evaluated the relationship between sucking habits and malocclusion and swallowing habits of 10- to 11-year-old children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Among children with a history of a sucking habit, persistence of a tongue thrust swallowing pattern was found more commonly; this swallowing pattern was associated with Class II malocclusion, extreme maxillary overjet, and open bite. However, the tongue-thrust pattern did not account completely for malocclusion because there was an increased frequency of malocclusion independent of the swallowing pattern.</p><p>A study of 444 eight- and nine-year-old children who had extensive longitudinal nonnutritive sucking data collected periodically from birth found that prolonged pacifier habits (to 24 to 47 months of age) were associated with increased occurrence of anterior open bite and Class II malocclusion in the early mixed dentition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Prolonged digit habits were associated with anterior open bite, although any habit (digit <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pacifier) was associated with posterior crossbite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Otitis media</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The association between pacifier use and acute otitis media (AOM) has been reported in one meta-analysis and several prospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. The meta-analysis evaluating the risk factors for AOM found pacifier use was associated with increased risk of development of otitis media (pooled relative risk 1.24, 95% CI, 1.06-1.46) based upon two studies involving 4110 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/38,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,40,41</a>].

The association remains even after controlling for potential confounding variables including age, sex, birth weight, maternal education, and family income. In these studies, early cessation of breastfeeding is two to three times more likely to occur among pacifier users than nonusers. Pacifiers also have been associated with shorter duration of breastfeeding at each feeding event and fewer feeding events per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. It has been postulated that pacifier use may be a marker for breastfeeding problems or reduced motivation to breastfeed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. An alternative explanation is that pacifier use contributes to a faulty sucking technique, which in turn leads to breastfeeding problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/43,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,53,54</a>].</p><p>However, a cause-and-effect relationship between pacifier use and early cessation of breastfeeding has not been established, and a systematic review concluded that there was moderate quality evidence to suggest that pacifier use in healthy full-term infants does not reduce breastfeeding duration up to four months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>An association between digit sucking and early cessation of breastfeeding is reported in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>] but not in others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">SIDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An association between pacifier use and decreased incidence of SIDS has been reported in case-control studies (odds ratio 0.38 to 0.44 in various studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/56-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-60</a>].

These studies are limited by the lack of a consistent, clinically relevant definition of chronic mouth-breathing, leading to possible misclassification of subjects in at least some studies.

The narrow maxillary arch in chronic mouth-breathers is related to the altered position of the tongue in oral compared with nasal breathing. In nasal breathing, the tongue rests against the palate where it exerts lateral pressure and plays an important role in the widening of the maxillary arch. In contrast, in mouth-breathing, the tongue rests lower in the oral cavity and thus exerts less lateral pressure on the maxillary arch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Mandibular rotation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Permanent teeth typically continue to erupt until they make contact with teeth or tissue in the opposing arch.

It is reported to occur in 15 to 24 percent of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/96-98\" class=\"abstract_t\">96-98</a>]. The frequency of bruxism peaks between 7 and 10 years of age, and then it decreases; it rarely persists through adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/6,96,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,96,99</a>]. In children, although bruxism is sometimes linked to stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>] or parasomnias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oral-habits-and-orofacial-development-in-children/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>], it is typically a self-limited problem and rarely requires intervention.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Nonnutritive sucking'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonnutritive sucking is associated with increased prevalence of malocclusion in the primary and mixed dentition and increased risk of trauma to the upper front teeth. The prevalence of malocclusion increases with increased duration of the sucking habit. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pacifier use is associated with an increased risk of otitis media, early cessation of breastfeeding, and decreased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). However, cause-and-effect relationships for these associations have not been established. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Otitis media'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Breastfeeding'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'SIDS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To minimize the dental effects of nonnutritive sucking, we recommend intervention to address sucking habits before three years of age. The level of intervention depends upon the severity of the problem. (See <a href=\"#H15700715\" class=\"local\">'Breaking the habit'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic mouth-breathing can be caused by chronic nasal <span class=\"nowrap\">obstruction/congestion,</span> adenoidal hypertrophy, or anatomic abnormalities, or it may be a learned habit. (See <a href=\"#H15700722\" class=\"local\">'Causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic mouth-breathing appears to be associated with orofacial effects, including narrowing of the maxillary arch, over-eruption of the permanent molars, and downward and posterior rotation of the mandible. It is not known what proportion of time must be spent in mouth-breathing to be clinically relevant. (See <a href=\"#H15700736\" class=\"local\">'Orofacial effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruxism is the habitual grinding of teeth, usually during sleep. The frequency of bruxism peaks between 7 and 10 years of age and then declines. In children, bruxism is typically a self-limited problem and rarely requires intervention.
