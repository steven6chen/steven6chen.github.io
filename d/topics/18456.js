They work by preparing the body to fight the germs that cause the infections. Vaccines usually come in shots, but some come in nose sprays or medicines that people swallow. Vaccines are also called &quot;vaccinations&quot; or &quot;immunizations.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643010852\"><span class=\"h1\">Why should I get vaccinated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Getting vaccinated can help keep you from getting certain serious infections. It's important to be vaccinated even if you don't become pregnant. But if you are pregnant and get certain infections, you can have problems during your pregnancy. Being vaccinated can also help keep your baby from getting sick.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643010859\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I know about vaccines if I am planning to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are planning to get pregnant, you should make sure that your vaccines are up to date. This means that you have gotten all of the vaccines that your doctor or nurse recommends. If you are not sure if you got all of your vaccines, your doctor or nurse might do a blood test to check.</p><p>It's especially important that women be up to date with their vaccines for measles, mumps, rubella, and chickenpox before they get pregnant. That's because vaccines to prevent these infections cannot be given to pregnant women. If women who have not been vaccinated do get these infections during pregnancy, they can have problems. Problems can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passing the infection on to the baby, either during pregnancy or in the first few months after birth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a miscarriage &ndash; A miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends on its own before the baby can live outside the womb.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giving birth too early</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a baby with a birth defect</p><p/><p>Women who need the measles, mumps, rubella, or chickenpox vaccines should get them at least 1 month before getting pregnant.</p><p>It's also important that women be up to date with a vaccine called the HPV vaccine before they get pregnant. The HPV vaccine is not given during pregnancy, although if a women gets it before knowing she is pregnant, it is safe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643010866\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need the chickenpox vaccine if I had chickenpox infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. If you had chickenpox infection in the past, you do not need to get the vaccine. People who have had chickenpox can't get the illness again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643010873\"><span class=\"h1\">Which vaccines are safe to get during pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some vaccines are safe to get during pregnancy. These include vaccines to prevent:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Influenza (flu) &ndash; All adults should get the flu vaccine each year. But it's especially important for pregnant women to get the flu vaccine. That's because pregnant women tend get more severely ill with the flu than people who are not pregnant. The flu vaccine can keep a woman from getting sick. It can also keep a baby from getting the flu during the first few months of life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis &ndash; Tetanus causes the muscles to work abnormally. Diphtheria can cause a thick covering in the back of the throat that can lead to breathing problems. Pertussis, also known as &quot;whooping cough,&quot; causes a severe cough. All pregnant women should get the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine at 27 to 36 weeks of pregnancy, even if they got it before. This is mostly to protect the baby from getting whooping cough in the first few months after birth. Whooping cough in babies can be serious or even deadly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some women might get other vaccines while they are pregnant. For example, women might need certain vaccines if they have other medical conditions or plan to travel to another country.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643010880\"><span class=\"h1\">How many vaccine doses do I need?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each vaccine is different. Some vaccines work after just 1 dose. Others need 2 or more doses to prevent an infection. Most vaccines take a few weeks to work.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643010887\"><span class=\"h1\">What side effects can vaccines cause?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Often, vaccines cause no side effects. When they do cause side effects, they can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness, mild swelling, or soreness where the shot was given</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mild fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mild rash</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache or body aches</p><p/><p>Vaccines also sometimes cause more serious side effects, such as severe allergic reactions. But serious side effects are rare.</p><p>Ask your doctor or nurse what side effects to expect each time you get a vaccine. If you have a reaction or a problem after a vaccine, let him or her know.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643010894\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I still get the flu vaccine if I have an egg allergy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Some forms of the flu vaccine do contain small amounts of egg. But the amount is so small that it does not cause an allergic reaction. If you have an egg allergy, you should still get the flu vaccine, especially if you are pregnant. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643010901\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am pregnant and never got the measles, mumps, rubella, or chickenpox vaccines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are pregnant and never got these vaccines and never had these infections, you should avoid people with these infections.</p><p>If you find out that someone around you has chickenpox or rubella, call your doctor or nurse as soon as possible. He or she can tell you if there is anything you should do.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1643010908\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Flu (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-travel-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for travel (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chickenpox-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chickenpox (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=staying-healthy-when-you-travel-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Staying healthy when you travel (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-hpv-vaccine-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tdap-vaccine-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tdap vaccine (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccination-during-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccination during pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=avoiding-infections-in-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Avoiding infections in pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adult-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Adult vaccines (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-prevention-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Influenza prevention (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
