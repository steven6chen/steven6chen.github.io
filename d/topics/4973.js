Approximately 85 to 90 percent of DFSPs are low grade, while the remainder contain a high-grade sarcomatous component (which is usually a fibrosarcoma, designated DFSP-FS) and are considered to be intermediate-grade sarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although they rarely metastasize (fewer than 5 percent of cases), all DFSP variants have a propensity to recur locally.</p><p>This topic review will focus on treatment of DFSP. The epidemiology, molecular pathogenesis, histology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of DFSP are discussed elsewhere, as are issues specific to DFSP arising in the head and neck region. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-and-neck-sarcomas#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Head and neck sarcomas&quot;, section on 'Desmoids and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531252089\"><span class=\"h1\">LOCALIZED DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preferred initial treatment for a localized dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is resection with pathologically negative margins. Tumor size and location dictate the most appropriate surgical procedure. Given that metastases to lymph nodes are extremely rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], there is no role for prophylactic regional node dissection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging#H337960\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Metastatic disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101941497\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of resection margins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the characteristic features of DFSP is its capacity to invade surrounding tissues in an eccentric fashion to a considerable distance from the central focus of the tumor, with tumor cells invading subcutaneous tissue in the form of irregular tentacle-like projections through the septa and fat lobules. This fact, coupled with the rarity of DFSP and diagnostic delay, often leads to inadequate initial resection. The risk of a local recurrence is as high as 50 percent with simple excision (&quot;conservative&quot; surgical margins), and it is even higher if the margins are positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/1,3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Histology'</a>.)</p><p>The status of the surgical margins is the most important prognostic factor in patients with DFSP:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognostic importance of resection margins was shown in a series of 159 patients (134 DFSP, 25 DFSP with sarcomatous transformation [DFSP-FS]) treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering over a 48-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The resection margins were involved in 51 patients (32 percent), close (&lt;1 mm) in 15 (10 percent), and otherwise negative in 93 (58 percent). At a median follow-up of 57 months, there were 34 recurrences, 29 of which developed in patients with positive or close margins. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A compilation of five literature-based series of patients with DFSP treated with undefined or conservative surgical margins (n = 116 patients) noted local recurrence rates between 26 and 60 percent, averaging 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In contrast, recurrence rates in published series of patients treated with wide local excision (WLE; n = 661) ranged from 0 to 42 percent, averaging 9 percent.</p><p/><p>Although localized recurrences can frequently be salvaged with further surgery, locally recurrent tumors have a significant propensity for deep invasion into the fascia, muscle, or bone, which increases the risk for both inadequate resection and functional, as well as cosmetic, defects. Furthermore, local recurrence also predisposes to distant metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/1,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7-9</a>]. In the above noted series, both patients who developed fatal metastatic disease had initially incompletely resected DFSP-FS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>For all of these reasons, marginal resection should be avoided, and histologic assessment of the final resection margins is mandatory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101941504\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of diagnostic imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the characteristic histologic appearance of most DFSP on core needle or incisional biopsy, imaging techniques are not routinely used in the diagnostic process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Histology'</a>.)</p><p>However, because of the infiltrative nature of DFSP, simple clinical palpation is not entirely reliable for ascertaining the depth of tumor invasion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive than palpation for assessing depth of infiltration and may be useful for certain DFSPs, particularly large or recurrent tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-15</a>]. Characteristic findings on MRI are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging#H338676\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Staging evaluation'</a>.) </p><p>Although MRI is better than clinical palpation, the extent of local invasion may be difficult to appreciate preoperatively, even with optimal MRI evaluation, particularly in sites in the head and neck and upper thorax. The utility of MRI was shown in a study of 43 DFSPs, which included 22 primary tumors, nine recurrent tumors, and 12 tumors that were extirpated with positive margins and referred for Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Clinical palpation correctly predicted the depth of infiltration in the primary DFSP cases with a sensitivity of 58 percent, a specificity of 90 percent, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 88 percent, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 64 percent. The corresponding values for MRI were 67, 100, 100, and 71 percent, respectively. MRI was of little value in determining lateral tumor extension and lost precision for determining the depth of infiltration in tumors located in the head and neck and upper thorax; in seven of eight cases, MRI reported the affected plane to be more superficial than it actually was histologically. This finding was attributed to the lower thickness of the skin at these locations and the close proximity of the muscle to the cutaneous surface, which lessened the ability of MRI to detect spread to the fascia and muscle.</p><p>For recurrent DFSP, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of MRI were 60, 100, 100, and 67 percent, respectively. On the other hand, MRI was not accurate in cases with margin-positive excisions. Among 12 such patients, MRI suggested tumor persistence in five, tumor absence in two, and was uncertain in five. Histologic study revealed tumor persistence in 10 cases (only four of which were defined positive by MRI), and only two cases in which no tumor remained, neither of which were negative by MRI. These data suggest that MRI is beneficial for recurrent tumors but not for detecting tumor persistence in cases of incompletely extirpated tumors. </p><p>Computed tomography (CT) is only indicated in rare cases in which underlying bone involvement is suspected. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101941656\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete surgical resection is the optimal treatment for localized DFSP. The two options are WLE and MMS. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531252096\"><span class=\"h3\">Wide local excision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>WLE is an option for surgical management and is preferred over marginal excision for both DFSP and DFSP-FS. Although local recurrence rates are lower with WLE than with conservative or marginal excision, local recurrence rates range widely with WLE (from 4 to 47 percent), but they average 6 to 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/1,6,8,16-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,8,16-24</a>]. </p><p>Much of the variability relates to the width of the resection margin. The minimum resection margin needed to achieve local control is undefined. Mapping with MMS has revealed tentacle-like tumor projections that often extend beyond 3 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In a series of 66 French patients treated for DFSP between 1982 and 2002, local recurrences were significantly more frequent among those with a resection margin of &lt;3 cm, as compared with margins of 3 to 5 cm (47 versus 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Wider margins (5 cm) have been associated with even lower local recurrence rates (&lt;5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. These data form the basis of the recommendation by some that resection margins be at least 3 cm (down to and including the fascia) and as wide as 5 cm, depending on the primary tumor size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/4,8,16,19,20,22,26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,16,19,20,22,26-29</a>].

However, in practice, such margins are rarely possible without significant cosmetic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> functional deficit, particularly in anatomically challenging areas such as the head and neck. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-and-neck-sarcomas#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Head and neck sarcomas&quot;, section on 'Desmoids and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans'</a>.) </p><p>Others suggest that very low local recurrence rates (1 percent) and a high rate of primary closure (69 percent) can be achieved with narrower margins (median 2 cm, range 0.5 to 3 cm), as long as the surgical approach is standardized and pathologic evaluation of the margins is meticulous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/21,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,31,32</a>]. In one multi-institutional retrospective series of 204 patients undergoing WLE for a DFSP, 81 percent achieved negative margins with only one excision, 16 percent required two surgeries, 3 percent required three, and 1 percent, four resections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. At a median follow-up of 64 months, only two patients (both with head and neck primaries) recurred locally (1 percent).</p><p>Frequently, reconstruction with a skin graft or flap is necessary to repair the resulting wound after resection with wide margins. However, reconstruction should be delayed until negative histologic margins (including assessment of the complete circumferential and peripheral deep margins) are verified. If positive margins are diagnosed after WLE, most guidelines (including those of <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=89222\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCCN</a>) recommend reresection, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> (see below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531252103\"><span class=\"h3\">Mohs micrographic surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative to WLE, MMS is increasingly used for resection of large or recurrent DFSP and for those arising in anatomically challenging areas such as the head or neck. In contrast to WLE, which uses representative vertical sectioning, MMS utilizes sequential horizontal sectioning during the resection with immediate microscopic examination of the resected tissue by frozen section analysis (including rapid immunostaining for CD34 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]) until a clear margin is obtained. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mohs-surgery#H9314583\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mohs surgery&quot;, section on 'Surgical technique'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Immunohistochemistry'</a>.)</p><p>Some surgeons perform a modified &quot;slow&quot; MMS that uses formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded permanent sections (with conventional immunohistochemical staining for CD34, which is more reliable than rapid CD34 immunostaining on frozen sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/6,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,34</a>]) throughout the duration of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. However, in contrast to the frozen section processing time of one to two hours, paraffin sections take longer, and use of the modified MMS technique may spread the procedure over many days, thereby delaying wound reconstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mohs-surgery#H10634124\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mohs surgery&quot;, section on 'Specific indications'</a>.) </p><p>To limit the number of stages required to clear the tumor, many Mohs surgeons initially debulk the tumor with the excision made just beyond the visible tumor margin and beneath the tumor mass; the first Mohs layer is then taken as a relatively wide (0.5 to 1.0 cm) margin of tissue excision around and under the debulked tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/34,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36,37</a>]. The specimen is oriented using silk sutures and photographed, then the tissue is divided into multiple specimens mapped for precise anatomic orientation. Each specimen is then processed, and sections are evaluated under the microscope for evidence of tumor involvement. In patients with positive margins, the residual tumor is excised with additional 0.5 cm margins. The cyclic process of excision, mapping, and microscopic examination is repeated until tumor is no longer microscopically detected. In general, a higher number of stages are required to resect DFSP-FS than conventional DFSP due to the deeper infiltration of these lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>A high probability of cure of DFSP can be attained with MMS, as long as the final margins are negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/6,20,21,39-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,20,21,39-45</a>]. Although randomized trials have not been conducted, the available data from nonrandomized comparative and noncomparative single center studies suggest that local recurrence rates are lower after MMS than after WLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/6,20,21,23,27,32,35,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,20,21,23,27,32,35,46,47</a>]. As an example, in a systematic review of 23 nonrandomized trials focusing on recurrence rates among patients undergoing MMS or WLE for DFSP, the local recurrence rate after MMS was 1.11 percent (95% CI 0.02-6.03) versus 6.32 percent (95% CI 3.19-11.02) for WLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Furthermore, one of the main benefits of MMS is the ability to minimize surgical margins, thus preserving cosmetically and functionally vital tissue. Compared with WLE with surgical margins of &ge;3 cm, MMS permits maximal conservation of normal uninvolved tissue, which results in smaller wounds needing less complex reconstruction. As noted above, while there is controversy regarding the optimal width of the surgical margins with WLE, recommended margin widths are generally 2 to 4 cm. In the systematic review described above, a median maximum lateral margin of 1 to 2 cm resulted in complete excision for most tumors treated with MMS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>These data have led many to consider MMS as the preferred surgical approach for DFSP because of its high cure rate and ability to preserve normal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/20,30,44,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,30,44,48</a>]. However, some argue that MMS is histologically inadequate since even on paraffin sections, it can be difficult to differentiate minimal residual DFSP cells from scattered spindle cells in normal dermis, scar, or connective tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/6,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,49</a>]. In an attempt to minimize this problem, many Mohs surgeons send a final stage after clearing the tumor with the traditional MMS frozen sectioning for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections to confirm that the margins are in fact histologically clear. </p><p>However, there are no randomized trials that demonstrate the superiority of MMS over other surgical methods and a lack of long-term data on MMS, which is important given that the median time to recurrence is approximately three years postsurgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Furthermore, there are cost and access considerations, with the estimated cost of MMS being higher than that for WLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>] and availability of MMS being dependent on local expertise. </p><p>Thus, although a possible benefit for MMS has been suggested in retrospective case series, the choice between MMS and WLE remains a matter of judgment based upon the location and size of the tumor, perceived recurrence risk, availability, and cost. </p><p>For cosmetically sensitive areas, where achieving narrow margins is preferable, MMS represents a preferred choice for therapy, where available. In other less cosmetically sensitive areas, WLE with 2 to 4 cm margins and histologic margin confirmation is still an acceptable procedure. For DFSP-FS, we prefer WLE over MMS. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531252110\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although DFSP is a radioresponsive tumor, radiation therapy (RT) is only rarely used as a primary treatment. There are scant data pertaining to the efficacy of RT when used alone for gross disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/3,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,51</a>]. In an early series, all three patients treated with RT (67 to 75 Gy) after an intralesional excision remained locally controlled at 85, 106, and 108 months posttreatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, in a second report, a single patient who received RT alone for gross disease recurrence after surgery did not achieve disease control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. These data suggest that RT is not a substitute for inadequate resection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H531252117\"><span class=\"h3\">RT following surgical resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the absence of randomized clinical trials proving benefit, adjuvant RT is commonly recommended in conjunction with wide local resection of large tumors, or when the surgical margins are close or positive and further surgery is not feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/3,51-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,51-56</a>]. Whether administered before or after surgery, RT significantly reduces the risk of a local recurrence.</p><p>There are no randomized trials addressing the benefit of RT after resection. Several retrospective case series and cohort studies have been reported, primarily of patients undergoing local excision followed by RT. A meta-analysis of twelve of these reports (totaling 167 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/3,21,51,54,55,57-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,21,51,54,55,57-63</a>] came to the following conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients (92) had positive or close resection margins, while 45 were negative, and 30 were unknown.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local recurrence rates after RT ranged from 0 to 25 percent (pooled estimate 11.7 percent); the rate among patients with positive or close margins was 14.2 percent, while there was no recurrence among those with negative margins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the two studies that addressed this issue, the pooled estimate of local recurrence between surgery alone and surgery combined with RT (72 patients total, 45 treated with surgery alone and 27 with adjuvant RT) was potentially clinically meaningful but not statistically significant (odds ratio 0.31, 95% CI 0.09-1.08) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].</p><p/><p>These data support the view that conservative resection and postoperative RT could be considered in situations in which adequate WLE alone would result in major cosmetic or functional deficits, particularly if the expertise to perform MMS is not available.</p><p>The presence of a sarcomatous component within the tumor (ie, DFSP-FS) is not, by itself, viewed as an indication for postoperative RT. While the overall rate of distant metastases and prognosis are worse, whether tumors that contain a sarcomatous component have a worse local recurrence rate is unclear. Although some series suggest that local control rates are worse for patients with DFSP-FS compared with conventional DFSP, others do not, as long as surgical excision is adequate.

The best data come from a series of 260 cases of DFSP undergoing surgical treatment in a single Chinese center over a 21-year period; there were 226 cases of classic DFSP and 34 DFSP-derived sarcomatous variants (32 fibrosarcoma and two malignant fibrous histiocytoma); 91 percent underwent WLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans-treatment/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

Although it is difficult to determine which cases are at risk for metastasis, they generally involve recurrent lesions that have progressed for many years and when a fibrosarcomatous component is present (ie, DFSP-FS).
