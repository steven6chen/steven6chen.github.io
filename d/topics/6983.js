The FVL mutation renders factor V (both the activated and inactive forms) insensitive to the actions of activated protein C (aPC), a natural anticoagulant. As a result, individuals who inherit the FVL mutation are at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, FVL is extremely common in the population, and many individuals with the mutation will never have a VTE. For these reasons, VTE risk reduction (both primary prevention and prevention of recurrence) may involve some challenging decisions.</p><p>This topic review discusses the diagnosis of FVL and the management of individuals who carry this mutation.</p><p>Separate topic reviews discuss other thrombophilias and the role of thrombophilia screening in various populations:</p><p>Other thrombophilias:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prothrombin G20210A mutation</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prothrombin-g20210a-mutation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prothrombin G20210A mutation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Protein C deficiency</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-c-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protein C deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Protein S deficiency</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-s-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protein S deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>AT deficiency</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombin-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombin deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>APS</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>PNH</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>MPN</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-myeloproliferative-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the myeloproliferative neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Role of screening:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Children</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for inherited thrombophilia in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Asymptomatic individuals</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-asymptomatic-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for inherited thrombophilia in asymptomatic adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pregnancy</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy#H7898324\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited thrombophilias in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Selection of patients for testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Individuals with VTE</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-adult-patients-with-established-venous-thromboembolism-for-acquired-and-inherited-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluating adult patients with established venous thromboembolism for acquired and inherited risk factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ischemic stroke</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-stroke-in-children-evaluation-initial-management-and-prognosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ischemic stroke in children: Evaluation, initial management, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Hypercoagulable state evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke#H39\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the evaluation of stroke&quot;, section on 'Blood tests'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3907864349\"><span class=\"h2\">Biology of factor V and protein C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factor V, encoded by the <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/612309&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWGyMduskH1tarBX5qGUAR2NqVjW8sf9yC5/P4t+lh2mF&amp;TOPIC_ID=1355\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">F5</a> gene, is a procoagulant clotting factor that amplifies the production of thrombin, the central enzyme that converts fibrinogen to fibrin, which leads to clot formation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69920\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69920 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90873\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90873 \">figure 2</a>). Factor V is synthesized as an inactive factor that circulates in plasma. A small amount of thrombin at the site of a wound activates factor V by limited proteolysis. This activated factor V (factor Va) then serves as a cofactor in the prothrombinase complex, which cleaves prothrombin to generate more thrombin, in a positive feedback loop. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;, section on 'Multicomponent complexes'</a>.)</p><p>Thrombin (bound to thrombomodulin on the surface of endothelial cells) also slows its own production by creating a separate negative feedback loop. It does this by converting protein C to activated protein C (aPC), a protease that acts as a potent natural anticoagulant. aPC degrades activated factor Va (and activated factor VIIIa, upstream in the coagulation cascade), ultimately reducing thrombin production. aPC uses protein S as a cofactor in all of its cleavage reactions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;, section on 'Activated protein C and protein S'</a>.)</p><p>Factor V Leiden (<a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/188055&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWO0cxJ6Fpme2hkQE9zJNrAouu16cbyZQ0jWCuHYy0tJm&amp;TOPIC_ID=1355\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">FVL</a>) results from a single point mutation in the factor V gene (guanine to adenine at nucleotide 1691), which leads to a single amino acid change (replacement of arginine with glutamine at amino acid 506); hence the names factor V R506Q and factor V Arg506Gln. This abolishes the Arg506 cleavage site for aPC in factor V and factor Va. This defect was initially termed &quot;aPC resistance&quot; because the anticoagulant activity of aPC was reduced in a modified activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay.</p><p>aPC-mediated cleavage of factor V and Va have different consequences for protein function. aPC cleavage of the procoagulant factor Va causes factor Va degradation, whereas aPC cleavage of the anticoagulant factor V enhances factor V function. FVL is insensitive to both of these cleavages because it lacks the Arg506 cleavage site. Thus, the FVL mutation simultaneously increases coagulation by creating two distinct changes in the coagulation cascade:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Enhanced procoagulant role of factor Va</strong> &ndash; aPC destroys factor Va in a series of sequential cleavages. The first cleavage at Arg506 exposes additional cleavage sites at Arg306 and Arg679. Since <strong>activated</strong> FVL cannot be cleaved at Arg506, these other sites remain buried in the protein, resulting in 20-fold slower degradation of activated FVL. The extended presence of activated FVL results in continued thrombin generation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reduced anticoagulant role of factor V</strong> &ndash; aPC cleavage of unactivated factor V at position 506 enhances its ability to act as a cofactor in the degradation of factors Va and VIIIa. Since <strong>unactivated</strong> FVL cannot be cleaved at Arg506, it is less effective as a cofactor for aPC, resulting in reduced degradation of factors Va and VIIIa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-v-leiden-and-activated-protein-c-resistance/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p/><p>The reduced cleavage of activated FVL by aPC and the impaired cleavage of unactivated FVL by aPC appear to contribute equally to the phenomenon of FVL-associated aPC resistance and the ensuing hypercoagulable state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-v-leiden-and-activated-protein-c-resistance/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. The FVL mutation accounts for more than 95 percent of cases of hereditary aPC resistance, with the remainder of aPC resistance cases due to other inherited mutations and other acquired factors. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Other causes of aPC resistance'</a> below.)</p><p>The dual roles of factor V also help to explain why the risk of thrombosis is greater in patients homozygous or pseudohomozygous for FVL (ie, compound heterozygous for FVL and factor V deficiency) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-v-leiden-and-activated-protein-c-resistance/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. In contrast, the plasma of FVL <strong>heterozygotes</strong> contains both FVL and normal factor V. The normal factor V has aPC cofactor activity for the inactivation of factor VIIIa, affording some protection against thrombosis. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'FVL genotypes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">FVL genotypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FVL is an autosomal dominant condition, and 99 percent of individuals with FVL are heterozygous for the mutation. The other 1 percent are homozygotes or the extremely rare cases with pseudo-homozygosity for FVL due to heterozygous FVL plus a mutation on the other factor V allele that causes factor V deficiency, resulting in FVL as the only available form of factor V in their circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-v-leiden-and-activated-protein-c-resistance/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. These patients appear to be more thrombosis prone than heterozygous relatives with FVL alone, with a clinical phenotype similar to or more severe than that of FVL homozygotes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-v-leiden-and-activated-protein-c-resistance/abstract/5,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10,11</a>]. The plasma of these individuals manifests severe aPC resistance in aPTT assays. FVL homozygous or pseudohomozygous individuals are disproportionately represented clinically because of a higher thrombotic risk.

The reasons for the highly variable phenotype are incompletely understood; it may be explained in part by the coexistence of other inherited thrombophilias or other genetic modifiers that can increase thrombosis risk.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other inherited thrombophilias</strong> &ndash; The presence of a second thrombophilic mutation may increase the risk of VTE associated with FVL.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There have been reports of early presentations of thrombosis in patients with antithrombin (AT) deficiency as well as the FVL mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/factor-v-leiden-and-activated-protein-c-resistance/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. As the genes for AT and factor V are both on the long arm of chromosome 1, the defects in families in which both mutant genes are on the same chromosome will always occur together.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is evidence of a higher prevalence of protein S and protein C deficiencies in individuals with FVL who have had a VTE compared with individuals with FVL who have not had a VTE.

Both of these mechanisms contribute to the increased risk of thrombosis in FVL heterozygotes. This risk may be further increased by homozygosity or pseudo-homozygosity for FVL, or by other inherited or acquired thrombophilias. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Physiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heterozygosity for the FVL mutation is the most common inherited thrombophilia in unselected Caucasian populations (prevalence, approximately 1 to 5 percent) and the most common inherited thrombophilia in individuals with venous thromboembolism (VTE; prevalence, approximately 10 to 20 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F108016\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108016 \">table 2</a>).

However, only a small percentage of individuals with FVL will develop VTE in their lifetime (approximate risk, 4 to 5 percent for FVL heterozygotes in the general population and up to 20 percent in thrombophilic families). Risk is greater in the setting of homozygosity for FVL or compound heterozygosity for FVL and another inherited thrombophilia. The most common site of VTE is deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, but other sites are also seen including superficial veins of the leg and cerebral, portal, and hepatic veins.
