The pulmonary cachexia syndrome is associated with an accelerated decline in functional status and can affect patients with any type of advanced lung disease, although it is best studied and described in association with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The incidence of undernutrition in patients with COPD depends on disease severity and the methods used to define nutritional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. When cachexia is defined as less than 90 percent of ideal body weight, 20 to 50 percent of patients with COPD are underweight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the Intermittent Positive-Pressure Breathing (IPPB) Trial, 24 percent of the patients were underweight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In the same study, among patients with an FEV<sub>1</sub> of less than 35 percent predicted, 50 percent were undernourished. Thus, the severity of airway obstruction correlates with the risk of undernutrition. Skeletal muscle wasting and dysfunction in advanced lung disease may be under recognized clinically, especially in overweight or obese patients, but may still signal a higher risk for morbidity and mortality. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H714879627\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The consensus definition of cachexia is: &quot;a complex metabolic syndrome associated with underlying illness and characterized by loss of muscle with or without loss of fat mass. The prominent clinical feature of cachexia is weight loss in adults (corrected for fluid retention)&hellip;Anorexia, inflammation, insulin resistance, and increased muscle protein breakdown are frequently associated with cachexia&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In outcomes studies in COPD, the presence of pulmonary cachexia has traditionally been determined by a weight &lt;90 percent of ideal body weight (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-ideal-body-weight-method-of-devine-and-dosing-weight-for-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) or a body mass index (BMI) &le;20 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-quetelets-index-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>). A more precise determination of pulmonary cachexia, based on the consensus definition above, would ideally include assessment of loss of lean body mass via the lean body mass index (LBMI), which requires measurement of percent body fat by a method such as single-frequency bioelectrical impedance and use of regression equations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. An LBMI &lt;17 in men or &lt;14 in women indicates the presence of cachexia. </p><p>In clinical practice, clinical features, such as weight loss &gt;5 percent, a weight &lt;90 percent of ideal body weight, or a BMI &le;20, are used as surrogate measures until a validated screening tool for cachexia becomes available. The assessment and diagnosis of malnutrition are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric nutrition: Nutritional issues in older adults&quot;, section on 'Screening for nutritional status'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Contributing factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the exact pathogenesis of pulmonary cachexia syndrome remains unclear, it seems likely that a disease-induced energy imbalance promotes cachexia and muscle wasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Factors contributing to energy imbalance likely include changes in metabolism and caloric intake, aging, disuse atrophy, tissue hypoxia, inflammation, and medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Given that only 20 to 40 percent of patients with COPD develop cachexia, there are likely genetic polymorphisms that underlie differential susceptibilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/3,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Metabolism and caloric intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basal metabolism in patients with advanced lung disease does not follow the expected age-related decline seen in normal individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Many patients are hypermetabolic (consume more calories per kg on calorimetric measures), probably because of the increased work of breathing. As an example, patients with COPD can have a ten times increase in daily energy expenditure for respiratory muscles over the baseline of 36 to 72 calories per day in a patient with normal lung function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Despite hypermetabolism, COPD patients have a reduced dietary intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], due in part to an alteration in appetite regulation, which may be mediated by systemic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Aging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>COPD tends to be a disease of older adults. With normal aging, body composition changes as individuals progressively lose nonfat body mass (primarily muscle tissue) and progressively increase fat stores. The decline in muscle mass reduces muscle strength and decreases the basal metabolic rate. The net result of these alterations is a reduction in exercise capacity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric nutrition: Nutritional issues in older adults&quot;, section on 'Undernutrition syndromes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise physiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Aging also causes a number of changes that can reduce exercise capacity independent of senescent cardiopulmonary and muscle function. As an example, osteoporosis is more common in older individuals (particularly those with a history of smoking and significant glucocorticoid use) and can contribute to vertebral fractures that produce kyphosis, pain, decreased diaphragmatic excursion, and impaired clearance of respiratory secretions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-glucocorticoid-induced-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and evaluation of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Muscle wasting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muscle wasting in advanced lung disease is likely due to a mixture of poor nutrition, deconditioning, aging, and sometimes medication (eg, oral glucocorticoids). Reduced cardiopulmonary reserve limits the physical activity of patients with advanced lung disease causing deconditioning. The deleterious effect of limited activity on muscle wasting was supported by a study that found that inactive older patients have greater loss of muscle mass than active age-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In a separate study, quadriceps strength and endurance were reduced in patients with fibrotic lung disease compared with healthy, age-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Muscle wasting, in turn, probably further decreases cardiopulmonary reserve, creating a vicious cycle. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric nutrition: Nutritional issues in older adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric nutrition: Nutritional issues in older adults&quot;, section on 'Sarcopenia'</a>.)</p><p>Physical inactivity may not be the only cause of muscle wasting in patients with advanced lung disease. Patients with COPD also suffer from a loss of the peripheral muscle oxidative phenotype, which renders their muscles less energy efficient and more prone to oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This may augment loss of muscle mass.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypoxia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adequate tissue oxygenation requires appropriate matching of oxygen demand and delivery at the cellular level. In patients with advanced lung disease, the increased work of breathing further increases oxygen demand, while the ability to respond to these increased demands is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This phenomenon is best described in patients with emphysema, where a reduced ability to augment cardiac output results in a limitation of oxygen delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Blood flow is maintained to critical sites such as the ventilatory muscles, the heart, and the central nervous system, while peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscles develop an oxygen and nutrient debt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any chronic inflammatory condition can theoretically contribute to weight loss, particularly in patients who are also hypermetabolic. Certain cytokines have been studied as a possible cause of disease-associated wasting syndromes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) is associated with cachexia in a number of conditions, but it is uncertain whether the increased TNF-a is a cause or effect of weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

These changes in turn are associated with increased oxidative stress (an imbalance between the production of free radicals during exercise and neutralization by antioxidants), which may render the muscle more susceptible to the toxic effects of free radicals and cause muscle wasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In addition, type II fibers are generally more susceptible to atrophy due to inflammation and hypoxia. In patients with COPD, the loss of oxidative compensatory mechanisms may accelerate the loss of muscle mass thereby linking muscle quality to muscle quantity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/10,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids, which are frequently used to treat exacerbations of COPD, play an important role in wasting syndromes by inhibiting protein synthesis and promoting protein catabolism, despite their usual effect to increase appetite. The muscle wasting effects of glucocorticoids (also known as glucocorticoid-induced myopathy) appear dose-related, with doses &gt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> leading to reductions in respiratory muscle strength and a delay in the recovery of muscle function for several weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The effects of low-dose glucocorticoids (&lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> are more controversial; some studies have revealed no effect on respiratory muscle strength in individuals with normal respiratory function, but reduced inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength in patients with advanced lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. The extent to which low-dose glucocorticoids cause changes in body composition is unclear.

As an example, cachexia is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/8,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,36-38</a>]. Among patients with COPD who meet the definition of cachexia based on a low lean body mass index (&lt;17 in men and &lt;14 in women), median survival is reduced by almost half from about four to two years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91087\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91087 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In a separate study of patients with advanced COPD requiring supplemental oxygen, survival decreased in correlation with BMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The effect of low BMI on survival is also reflected in the inclusion of a BMI &le;21 as a marker of more severe disease in the BODE index, which assesses mortality risk (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-bode-index-for-copd-survival-prediction-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 3</a>).

This effect may be related to increased muscle breakdown due to cachexia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In patients with COPD and a body weight within the normal range, diaphragm muscle mass, length, and thickness vary with body weight in a fashion similar to individuals with normal lung function.</p><p>Among patients without lung disease, carbon dioxide retention begins when respiratory muscle strength is &lt;50 percent of normal and becomes marked when respiratory muscle strength is &lt;25 to 35 percent of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In patients with advanced lung disease, mechanical abnormalities (eg, airflow limitation in COPD, lung stiffness in pulmonary fibrosis) increase the work of breathing; therefore, hypercapnic respiratory failure occurs with lesser degrees of respiratory muscle weakness. Thus, malnutrition is associated with progressive diaphragmatic weakness and hypercapnic respiratory failure, an effect that is exacerbated in patients with advanced lung disease.</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency is associated with reduced lung function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. A cross-sectional survey using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey that included 14,091 people found that the mean FEV<sub>1</sub> and mean FVC were 126 and 172 mL greater, respectively, for the highest quintile of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level compared to the lowest quintile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Vitamin D levels are influenced by serum levels of vitamin D binding protein (VDBP), which is a carrier protein for vitamin D with effects on macrophage activation and neutrophil chemotaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

As an example, serum VDBP is decreased in cystic fibrosis and levels correlate with poor nutritional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The association of weight loss and muscle wasting with morbidity and mortality in COPD, as described above, provides the rationale for the interventions to improve nutritional status (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Effect of cachexia on mortality and lung function'</a> above). For patients with advanced lung disease and concerning weight loss or other criteria for pulmonary cachexia, we advise nutritional support (diet and oral supplements) and exercise (or other anabolic stimuli). Two meta-analyses have concluded that nutritional intervention in COPD is effective in improving weight, body composition, and exercise performance in malnourished COPD patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87804414\"><span class=\"h3\">Screening for malnutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with advanced lung disease should be monitored for the presence of pulmonary cachexia or concerning weight loss approximately every 6 to 12 months or at the time of routine visits.

The limited ability of these patients to augment ventilation has raised concern that increased oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide production (VCO<sub>2</sub>) due to nutritional supplementation may make ventilatory management and weaning difficult. In order to avoid excess VCO<sub>2</sub> in patients with advanced lung disease who are mechanically ventilated, we avoid overfeeding by selecting appropriate dosing weights. While VCO<sub>2</sub> is also determined by the carbohydrate-to-fat ratio, we generally choose a standard nutritional formula, rather than a &quot;pulmonary&quot; formula, as outcomes studies have not demonstrated a clear benefit to high fat-low carbohydrate formulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoiding overfeeding</strong> &ndash; Overfeeding generally occurs when carbohydrate intake is greater than or equal to 1.5 times the resting energy expenditure and causes excess CO<sub>2</sub> production (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63817\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63817 \">figure 3</a>). Therefore, patients with advanced lung disease should receive a caloric intake that matches estimated energy expenditure, in order to avoid excess CO<sub>2</sub> production.

Thus, low <span class=\"nowrap\">carbohydrate/high</span> fat enteral nutrition was developed with the intention of reducing the work of breathing and facilitating weaning from the ventilator. In theory, increases in VCO<sub>2</sub> can be limited by the use of nutritional preparations in which a greater percentage of calories comes from lipids than carbohydrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>].

Patients with pulmonary cachexia typically have weight loss and muscle wasting, which are associated with an accelerated decline in function and mortality. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary cachexia syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of pulmonary cachexia has traditionally been determined by a weight &lt;90 percent of ideal body weight (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-ideal-body-weight-method-of-devine-and-dosing-weight-for-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) or a body mass index (BMI) &le;20 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-quetelets-index-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>). If advanced measures are available to calculate the lean body mass index (LBMI), the thresholds used are LBMI &lt;17 in men and &lt;14 in women. (See <a href=\"#H87804414\" class=\"local\">'Screening for malnutrition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The exact pathogenesis of pulmonary cachexia syndrome is likely multifactorial, including changes in metabolism and caloric intake, aging, lack of exercise, tissue hypoxia, inflammation, medications, and possibly genetic predisposition. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Contributing factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with pulmonary cachexia syndrome, nutritional treatment is appropriate due to the increased risk for mortality demonstrated in COPD patients in this weight range and the (modest) benefits that have been associated with nutritional support in clinical trials. (See <a href=\"#H179057635\" class=\"local\">'Benefits of nutritional support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutritional treatment of pulmonary cachexia syndrome typically includes providing sufficient calories to meet basal energy expenditure and induce weight gain. Strategies to enhance caloric intake include eating small frequent meals with nutrient-dense foods (eg, liquid nutritional supplements), eating meals that require little preparation (eg, microwaveable), resting before meals, and taking a daily multivitamin. (See <a href=\"#H179057128\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise has been shown to improve the effectiveness of nutritional therapy and to stimulate appetite. We encourage patients to participate in a pulmonary rehabilitation program to increase their exercise endurance. (See <a href=\"#H179057121\" class=\"local\">'General measures for prevention and treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-rehabilitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary rehabilitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with pulmonary cachexia syndrome who are unable to increase their weight with the above interventions, we suggest a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megestrol-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">megestrol acetate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxandrolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxandrolone</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Since progesterone analogs and anabolic steroids have little or no effect on exercise capacity and carry the potential for adverse effects, their efficacy in achieving weight gain should be assessed in individual patients and the medication discontinued in the absence of benefit. (See <a href=\"#H82797064\" class=\"local\">'Medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to enhanced nutrition and exercise, concomitant interventions include steps to reduce the work of breathing (eg, bronchodilators), improve oxygen delivery (eg, oxygen therapy), and control inflammation, if indicated (eg, inhaled glucocorticoids). (See <a href=\"#H179057121\" class=\"local\">'General measures for prevention and treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with respiratory failure complicating with advanced lung disease, nutritional support (eg, tube feedings, parenteral nutrition) can increase oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. We avoid administering excess total calories, as overfeeding can cause excess carbon dioxide production and is not otherwise beneficial. We generally select standard diets in which fat comprises 20 to 40 percent of the total calories, rather than high <span class=\"nowrap\">fat/low</span> carbohydrate formulas, as the latter have not been shown to be beneficial. (See <a href=\"#H604868349\" class=\"local\">'Carbohydrates and excess carbon dioxide production'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-enteral-nutrition#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Enteral nutrition&quot;, section on 'Carbohydrate/fat'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When administering lipid emulsions parenterally, the rate of lipid infusion should not exceed 0.05 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> per hour (0.11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per hour) because higher infusion rates can have an adverse effect on gas exchange. (See <a href=\"#H604868356\" class=\"local\">'Effect of lipid infusion on gas exchange'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other nutritional considerations for these patients follow the recommendations for critically-ill patients in general.
