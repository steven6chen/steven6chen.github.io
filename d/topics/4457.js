These conditions are rare. The most common are nemaline myopathy, central core disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">centronuclear/myotubular</span> myopathies, and congenital fiber type disproportion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66572 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H49195541\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital myopathies share some common features, though severity is highly variable. Affected individuals usually present at birth or in infancy with hypotonia, weakness, hypoactive deep tendon reflexes, delayed motor milestones, and normal intelligence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Prominent facial weakness and ptosis are often present; associated findings may include dysmorphic features such as dolichocephaly, a long, narrow face, and a high-arched palate. The weakness is usually generalized or more prominent in proximal and limb-girdle muscles. However, the weakness in some congenital myopathies predominantly affects distal muscles or axial and respiratory muscles. Muscle weakness tends to be stable or slowly progressive over time. In the most severe cases, the presentation is that of the floppy infant with a frog-leg posture and respiratory and bulbar weakness.</p><p>The specific congenital myopathies are characterized on the basis of their histologic and histochemical features. These conditions are caused by genetic abnormalities of muscle development. They are distinct from the metabolic myopathies, in which deficiencies of energy production in muscle result from defects in lipid metabolism, glycogenosis, or other metabolic pathways. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metabolic-myopathies-caused-by-disorders-of-lipid-and-purine-metabolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metabolic myopathies caused by disorders of lipid and purine metabolism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-inherited-disorders-of-glucose-and-glycogen-metabolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of inherited disorders of glucose and glycogen metabolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>No specific treatment is available for these disorders. Management consists of physical therapy, nutritional support, assisted ventilation if indicated, and genetic counseling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NEMALINE MYOPATHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nemaline myopathy derives its name from the characteristic rod bodies in muscle that appear threadlike in longitudinal section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical expression of nemaline myopathy is variable. The presentation in affected newborns can be severe or relatively mild. In the former, profound generalized weakness and hypotonia involving the face, bulbar, and respiratory muscles is seen; the eye muscles are spared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The milder form, with relatively less facial weakness and diaphragm impairment, also can present in children or adults. Intermediate forms also are identified. In a series of 143 cases, presentation was typical congenital, severe congenital, intermediate congenital, childhood onset, and adult onset in 46, 16, 20, 13, and 4 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The pattern of weakness is consistent. Facial muscles, flexors of the neck and trunk, dorsiflexors of the feet, and extensors of the toes are most affected. The distal limb muscles and limb-girdle muscles are weaker than are the proximal limb muscles.</p><p>Some affected children have minor anomalies including a long thin face, high arched palate, and pectus excavatum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Other atypical features are arthrogryposis, central nervous system involvement, and congenital fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Cardiac disease may occur, with a progressive cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The clinical course depends upon the severity of the disease. In the severe neonatal form, death due to respiratory failure often occurs during the first year after birth. However, prolonged survival with improvement has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The milder form is considered to be nonprogressive or slowly progressive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The creatine kinase level usually is normal or only slightly elevated. Electromyography may show myopathic changes such as action potentials of small amplitude and short duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, these findings occur more commonly in older patients than in newborns. The diagnosis is confirmed by muscle biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathologic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The characteristic rod bodies are best seen with modified Gomori trichrome staining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. With this technique, they appear red against a blue-green myofibrillar background. The number of rods within muscle is variable and does not correlate with severity. Examples of nemaline rod muscle pathology are shown on the Washington University Neuromuscular Disease Center web site (<a href=\"http://neuromuscular.wustl.edu/pathol/rod.htm&amp;token=IqoBid0or68CrEatKjYyMg8uj6l68iECtkIV53LCkOcwGuXIT8s9ijtujkVJyDYaCSa0hMt1kvO/HZ4DR7iagA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=6150\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://neuromuscular.wustl.edu/pathol/rod.htm</a>).</p><p>On electron microscopy, the rods appear to originate from the Z-discs (the band normally found at both ends of the sarcomere) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. They sometimes are seen within the nucleus in the severe neonatal form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The rods are composed of alpha actinin and actin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Another consistent finding on muscle biopsy is the predominance of the smaller type 1 fibers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nemaline myopathy results from abnormalities of the thin filaments of skeletal muscle and is genetically heterogeneous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Specific defects involve mutations in the following genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/16-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NEB on chromosome 2q21.1-q22</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ACTA1 on 1q42</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TPM3 on 1q22-23</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TNNT1 on 19q13.4</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TPM2 on 9p13.2-p13.1</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CFL2 on 14q12</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NEFL on 8p21.2</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LMOD3 on 3p14.1</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>KBTBD13 on 15q22.31</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>KLHL40 on 3p21.33</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>KLHL41 on 2q31.1</p><p/><p>Several of these genes (NEB, ACTA1, TPM3, TNNT1, TPM2, CFL2, and LMOD3) encode for proteins that are components of or interact with muscle thin filaments, while NEFL encodes the neurofilament light polypeptide that is a component of the neuronal cytoskeleton. KBTBD13, KLHL40, and KLHL41 play a role in ubiquitination and protein degradation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The most common milder form of nemaline myopathy is caused by defects in the NEB gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive. A severe form of nemaline myopathy has been associated with defects in the ACTA1 gene. In one series, mutations in ACTA1 were identified in approximately 15 percent of patients with nemaline myopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In another series, ACTA1 mutations accounted for more than one-half of severe cases and one-quarter of all nemaline myopathy cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Inheritance of this form often is sporadic but may be autosomal dominant or recessive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Mutations in TNNT1, TPM2, and TPM3 are rare, accounting for 5 percent or less of all nemaline myopathy cases. TNNT1 causes an autosomal recessive form, and TPM2 a dominant form. TPM3 related nemaline myopathy has been associated with both autosomal dominant and recessive inheritance patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A rare autosomal-dominant form of nemaline myopathy caused by missense mutations in the KBTBD13 gene is characterized by normal neonatal development followed by childhood onset of slowly progressive weakness and slowness of movements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/23,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,31,32</a>]. It is on 15q22.31, which encodes for a hypothetical protein whose exact function remains undetermined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CENTRAL CORE DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central core disease (also called central core disease of muscle) was the first specific congenital myopathy to be recognized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central core disease typically presents in the neonatal period, although it may not be recognized until later infancy. The principal findings are hypotonia and muscle weakness, which usually are more prominent in the proximal extremities. Muscle involvement is variable and ranges from undetectable to severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In one series of eleven cases, disability ranged from clinically normal to no independent ambulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Patients often have mild facial weakness, but do <strong>not</strong> have ptosis, extraocular muscle weakness, dysphagia, or respiratory difficulty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Tendon reflexes usually are present, although they are reduced proportionally to the severity of the disease.</p><p>Musculoskeletal abnormalities commonly occur. They include congenital hip dislocation, kyphoscoliosis, joint contractures, and foot deformities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Affected patients are at risk for developing malignant hyperthermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-nonexertional-hyperthermia-classic-heat-stroke-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe nonexertional hyperthermia (classic heat stroke) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical course typically is nonprogressive. However, later progression of weakness can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In a series of 11 patients 4 to 20 years of age, two could not walk unassisted and two had difficulty climbing stairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

The creatine kinase level usually is normal. Electromyography may show minor myopathic changes. The diagnosis is confirmed by muscle biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathologic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic finding is the presence of cores of degenerated myofibrils in 20 to 100 percent of muscle fibers, which are predominantly type 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The cores are central or slightly eccentric in location and may be single or multiple in a specific fiber. Histochemical stains for oxidative enzymes show lack of staining in the core region resulting from the absence of mitochondria. Atrophy of type 1 fibers is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Examples of central core muscle pathology are shown on the Washington University Neuromuscular Disease Center web site (<a href=\"http://neuromuscular.wustl.edu/pathol/centcore.htm&amp;token=E6zelsFkNsN8FIuhRvz358y0Grmwm/OptJhmcqXgupL9RkUIx0rI9X6/OjRDs3Ojoq3w1E2MFMmYkPsQgIkQZA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=6150\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://neuromuscular.wustl.edu/pathol/centcore.htm</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases are caused by mutations in the gene encoding the ryanodine receptor (RYR1) that is localized to chromosome 19q13.1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/35,39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,39-41</a>]. The gene product forms the key channel that mediates calcium release in skeletal muscle during excitation-contraction coupling. In at least one mutation in this gene, muscle weakness in central core disease has been attributed to an uncoupling of excitation from calcium release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Mutations in the RYR1 gene also account for more than 50 percent of cases of malignant hyperthermia.

Onset is typically at birth or early in childhood. Manifestations include neonatal hypotonia, delayed motor development, and predominantly <span class=\"nowrap\">axial/proximal</span> muscle weakness. Some infants present with feeding difficulty and failure to thrive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Scoliosis (mean age of onset 8.5 years) and respiratory impairment occur in approximately two-thirds of patients with classic MmD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Respiratory involvement is often associated with secondary cardiac impairment, particularly right ventricular failure and cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Varying degrees of spinal rigidity are associated with the classic form. The spectrum includes rigid spine syndrome, also known as rigid spine muscular dystrophy, which some consider to be a form of classic MmD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. This disorder is caused by contractures of spinal extensor muscles and manifests with limited flexion of the spine, severe scoliosis in the first decade of life, marked respiratory involvement, a relatively mild and slowly progressive myopathy, and elbow and ankle contractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>The moderate form of MmD is characterized by hand weakness with joint hypermobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-myopathies/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Genetic confirmation of the diagnosis is possible in cases with selenoprotein N1 (SEPN1) or skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) mutations.

The most common are nemaline myopathy, central core disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">centronuclear/myotubular</span> myopathies, and congenital fiber type disproportion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66572\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66572 \">table 1</a>). The specific disorders are characterized on the basis of their histologic and histochemical features. These conditions are caused by genetic abnormalities of muscle development.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nemaline myopathy derives its name from the characteristic rod bodies in muscle that appear threadlike in longitudinal section. The clinical expression is variable. The presentation in affected newborns can be severe or relatively mild. In the former, profound generalized weakness and hypotonia involving the face, bulbar, and respiratory muscles is seen; the eye muscles are spared. The milder form, with relatively less facial weakness and diaphragm impairment, also can present in children or adults. Intermediate forms also are identified. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Nemaline myopathy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central core disease typically presents in the neonatal period, although it may not be recognized until later infancy. The principal findings are hypotonia and muscle weakness, which usually are more prominent in the proximal extremities. Muscle involvement is variable and ranges from undetectable to severe. Patients often have mild facial weakness, but do not have ptosis, extraocular muscle weakness, dysphagia, or respiratory difficulty. Tendon reflexes usually are present, although they are reduced proportionally to the severity of the disease. Commonly associated musculoskeletal abnormalities include congenital hip dislocation, kyphoscoliosis, joint contractures, and foot deformities. Affected patients are at risk for developing malignant hyperthermia. The clinical course typically is nonprogressive. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Central core disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiminicore disease (MmD; also known as multicore myopathy) is an autosomal recessive congenital myopathy that is named for the characteristic lesions called minicores that are present in most muscle fibers. The classic form of MmD is the most common. Onset is typically at birth or early in childhood. Manifestations include neonatal hypotonia, delayed motor development, and predominantly <span class=\"nowrap\">axial/proximal</span> muscle weakness. Some infants present with feeding difficulty and failure to thrive. Scoliosis and respiratory impairment occur in approximately two-thirds of patients with classic MmD. Respiratory involvement is often associated with secondary cardiac impairment, particularly right ventricular failure and cardiomyopathy. Varying degrees of spinal rigidity are associated with the classic form. The spectrum includes rigid spine syndrome, which some consider to be a form of classic MmD. Additional types of MmD include a moderate form with hand involvement, an antenatal form with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, and an ophthalmoplegic form. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Multiminicore disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The centronuclear myopathies, which include X-linked myotubular myopathy, are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by muscle fibers with large central nuclei that resemble myotubes, the early fetal muscle fibers. Centronuclear myopathies have two main clinical presentations. The severe, more common form of the disease is X-linked myotubular myopathy that occurs in males. Male infants have marked hypotonia and skeletal muscle weakness. Respiratory muscle impairment leads to respiratory failure. Facial weakness, ptosis, and extraocular muscle weakness are common, and impaired bulbar function contributes to feeding difficulty. Prenatal history includes polyhydramnios caused by impaired swallowing and decreased fetal movement in 50 to 60 percent of cases. Many infants fail to establish effective breathing at birth. The less common form occurs with autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance and consists of relatively mild weakness and hypotonia that may be unrecognized in the neonatal period. This form occurs in both males and females. Additional clinical subgroups have been characterized. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Centronuclear (myotubular) myopathies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital fiber type disproportion is characterized by small type 1 fibers on muscle biopsy, but without the structural changes seen in other congenital myopathies. Infants present with generalized hypotonia and weakness of the limbs, neck, trunk, and facial muscles. Most infants are severely affected but the extent of hypotonia and weakness is variable. Deformational features can include an elongated face, high arched palate, and multiple contractures. Musculoskeletal abnormalities, such as congenital hip dislocation, torticollis, and foot deformities typically occur. Scoliosis often develops later as a result of muscle weakness. Foot deformities, as well as polyhydramnios and decreased fetal movements, may be noted on prenatal assessment. The clinical course is variable. Most patients, even those with respiratory failure in the neonatal period, improve with age. However, others have significant disability in childhood and may develop progressive respiratory failure.
