It also may be seen in older children treated with antibiotics, inhaled glucocorticoids (for asthma or rhinitis), chemotherapy, or radiation therapy and in children with cellular immune deficiency, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of inhaled glucocorticoids&quot;, section on 'Topical candidiasis'</a>.)</p><p>Pseudomembranous oropharyngeal candidiasis is the most common form of oropharyngeal candidiasis.

Infants with thrush may be asymptomatic or may refuse to eat and swallow because of pain. Older children may be asymptomatic or may complain of a &quot;cottony&quot; feeling in the mouth, loss of taste, and sometimes pain on eating and swallowing.</p><p>Other forms of oropharyngeal candidiasis include angular cheilitis (perl&egrave;che) and acute atrophic candidiasis (glossitis).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angular cheilitis is characterized by painful fissuring at the corners of the mouth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71723\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71723 \">picture 2</a>). It may occur in immunocompromised children and children who habitually lick the corners of the mouth, creating an environment in which <em>Candida</em> can establish an infection.

It is caused by alteration of the bacterial microbiota of the oral mucosa.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H185638207\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oropharyngeal candidiasis is usually diagnosed clinically, based upon the characteristic white plaques (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69465\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69465 \">picture 1</a>). If necessary, it can be confirmed by scraping the lesions with a tongue depressor and performing a Gram stain or potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation on the scrapings. Demonstration of budding yeasts with or without hyphae confirms the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79879\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79879 \">picture 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-based-dermatologic-diagnostic-procedures#H4044416\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office-based dermatologic diagnostic procedures&quot;, section on 'Potassium hydroxide preparation'</a>.)</p><p>We do not routinely obtain cultures in children with oropharyngeal candidiasis. However, for children with recalcitrant or recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis, and children who have received antifungal prophylaxis with an azole agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluconazole</a>) and therefore are at greater risk for infection with an azole-resistant species, we obtain cultures to evaluate the possibility of an unusual or azole-resistant species (eg, <em>C. glabrata</em>, <em>C. krusei</em>).</p><p>We suggest evaluation for cellular immune deficiency, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing, for children with recalcitrant, recurrent, or extensive oropharyngeal candidiasis. Evaluation for cellular immune deficiency also may be warranted for children &ge;12 months of age who develop oropharyngeal candidiasis in the absence of a predisposing factor (eg, recent antibiotics, inhaled glucocorticoids, cancer, etc).

Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluconazole</a> may be used as an alternative to nystatin. In a randomized trial, compared with nystatin, oral fluconazole was associated with faster clearance of lesions, increased clinical cure rates (100 percent versus 29 percent), and increased mycologic cure rates (73 versus 6 percent); the rates of side effects were similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/candida-infections-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

It also may be seen in older children treated with antibiotics, inhaled glucocorticoids, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy and in children with cellular immunodeficiency. (See <a href=\"#H364112468\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oropharyngeal candidiasis is usually diagnosed clinically based upon the characteristic white plaques (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69465\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69465 \">picture 1</a>). If necessary, the diagnosis can be confirmed with Gram stain or potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation demonstrating budding yeast with or without hyphae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79879\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79879 \">picture 4</a>).

We generally use oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluconazole</a> for a total of 7 to 14 days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F115622\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115622 \">algorithm 2</a>).

Clinical features include involvement of the inguinal folds, confluent erythema with discrete papules, plaques, satellite lesions, and superficial scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59361%7EPEDS%2F72165\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59361 graphicRef72165 \">picture 6A-B</a>). Persistent <em>Candida</em> diaper rash may be a sign of type 1 diabetes mellitus, chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, or an underlying immunodeficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diaper-dermatitis#H33452433\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diaper dermatitis&quot;, section on 'Secondary infection'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical features of <em>Candida</em> intertrigo include erythematous, macerated plaques and erosions with peripheral scale, and satellite papulopustules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62523\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62523 \">picture 7</a>).

Additional risk factors in adolescents include certain contraceptive devices (vaginal sponges, diaphragms, intrauterine devices), estrogen therapy (including oral contraceptives), and pregnancy. Clinical features include itching, dysuria, vaginal irritation, vulvar erythema and swelling, vaginal erythema, and vaginal discharge. The diagnosis is typically made clinically but can be confirmed with a wet mount or KOH preparation of vaginal secretions demonstrating budding yeast, with or without hyphae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59030\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59030 \">picture 8</a>). (See <a href=\"#H364112958\" class=\"local\">'Vulvovaginitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Esophageal candidiasis occurs predominantly in individuals with hematologic malignancies and HIV infection. Retrosternal pain with swallowing is the hallmark clinical feature. The diagnosis is usually made endoscopically. However, in patients with HIV infection, a trial of systemic antifungal therapy may obviate the need for endoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Esophagitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis include severe, recurrent thrush (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F59947\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59947 \">picture 9</a>), vaginitis, onychomycosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71698\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71698 \">picture 10</a>), and chronic skin lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64895\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64895 \">picture 11</a>).

Neonates, immunocompromised hosts, and children in intensive care units are at greatest risk. The clinical manifestations vary from minimal fever to a fulminant sepsis syndrome indistinguishable from severe bacterial infection. Clinical clues to candidemia include characteristic eye lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58685%7EID%2F73318\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58685 graphicRef73318 \">picture 12A-B</a>), skin lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55977%7EID%2F75717\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55977 graphicRef75717 \">picture 13A-B</a>), and, less commonly, muscle abscesses.
