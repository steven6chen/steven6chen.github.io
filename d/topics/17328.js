Doctors use tissue adhesives to close certain types of cuts. Tissue adhesives hold a wound closed until it has a chance to heal. In some cases, tissue adhesives are a good alternative to stitches. They can cause less pain and be quicker to apply than stitches. Cuts closed with adhesives heal about as well as cuts closed with stitches.</p><p>Some examples of tissue adhesives and their brand names are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histoacryl</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PeriAcryl</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dermabond</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgiseal</p><p/><p>It is possible to buy some of these products without a prescription, but do not use them on your own, without input from a doctor or nurse. If used the wrong way, tissue adhesives can cause problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112170769\"><span class=\"h1\">When do doctors use tissue adhesives?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors most often use tissue adhesives for cuts that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are clean, straight, and short (less than 2 inches or 5 centimeters long)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close up neatly without causing the skin to be tight</p><p/><p>Doctors avoid tissue adhesives for wounds that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pull or gape open (unless they first use stitches to hold the layers underneath closed)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involve the hands, feet, or joints, unless those body parts are kept still (for example with a cast)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have ragged edges, involve crushing injuries, or do not close up neatly</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involve soft, wet tissues, such as those lining the mouth or vagina</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involve hairy areas, unless the hair is trimmed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Require the doctor to be very precise, for example, because they involve the hairline or the outline of the lips</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Were caused by a bite or puncture, or that could easily become infected</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Affect a person who is allergic to adhesives, has a bleeding disorder, or another problem that could delay or prevent proper healing</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112170782\"><span class=\"h1\">What will the doctor do when using a tissue adhesive?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before the doctor uses an adhesive, he or she will clean out your wound well. Then, the doctor will hold the edges of the cut together and apply the adhesive. If you have a deep cut, the doctor might stitch the inner layers of tissue before applying the adhesive to the outer edges. If the cut is long, he or she might use a special kind of tape (called Steri-strips or Leuko-strips) to hold it closed while it heals. After the wound is closed with the adhesive, the doctor will not use a bandage. The adhesive itself works like a bandage.</p><p><strong>How do I take care of my cut?</strong> &mdash; Your doctor or nurse will give you specific instructions, depending on the type of adhesive used and where your cut is.</p><p>Here is some general advice you can follow:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not bandage a wound treated with an adhesive. The adhesive works like a bandage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not use antibiotic ointment as it can break down the adhesive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You can shower while the adhesive is on your skin, but do not take a bath or soak or scrub the area for 7 to 10 days. Dry your skin by patting it gently with a towel.</p><p/><p>The adhesive will peel off on its own, usually by 5 to 10 days. If after 10 days, you still have adhesive on you, you can use antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly to get it off. You do not need to see the doctor again unless the wound doesn&rsquo;t heal well or you have signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or pus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112170797\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your cut opens up again.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You get a fever.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have pain, redness, or swelling around the cut, or pus drains from the cut.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112170810\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do after I heal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After you heal, you should protect the scar from the sun. Use sunscreen on the area or wear clothes or a hat that covers the scar.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse might also recommend that you use certain lotions or creams to help your scar heal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112170823\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stitches-and-staples-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stitches and staples (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=taking-care-of-cuts-and-scrapes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Taking care of cuts and scrapes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=taking-care-of-bruises-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Taking care of bruises (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
