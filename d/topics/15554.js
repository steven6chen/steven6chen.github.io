Computed tomographic (CT), positron emission tomographic (PET) scanning, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other imaging modalities (eg, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) guide the clinician in choosing the optimal site(s) for tissue sampling. The goals must be balanced with minimizing patient risk and accommodating patient preferences. The goals do not necessarily change for patients with significant comorbid disease or those with suspected advanced-stage disease. However, the risks and potential complications of biopsy in these patients may limit the preferred options.

However, if the initial selected diagnostic procedure does not establish the diagnosis or stage, additional procedures are necessary. Exceptions to this general approach may occur in patients with multiple limiting comorbidities or those with unambiguous clinical and radiographic evidence of metastasis. </p><p>Typical examples of utilizing the same procedure to acquire tissue for simultaneous diagnosis and staging of suspected NSCLC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109806\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109806 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-modality-for-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>] include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected T1a-cN0M0 (Stage I): For surgical candidates with a highly suspicious but solitary and small (eg, 15 to 30 mm) peripheral lung lesion with no evidence of mediastinal nodal or distant disease, we prefer surgical resection of the lung lesion and intraoperative mediastinal lymph node sampling. This approach is based upon the rationale that surgical resection in this population results in the highest rates of long-term survival since the likelihood of lymph node metastasis is low. If there is uncertainty about potential lymph node disease, pathology from lymph nodes sampled at the time of surgery would then dictate whether additional therapy is warranted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F94798\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94798 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F94799\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94799 \">image 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected M1b or M1c (stage IV): When imaging identifies suspected isolated (M1b) or multiple (M1c) metastases (eg, bone, adrenal or liver mass[es]), biopsy of such lesions may reveal NSCLC.

This assessment should occur in the context of their underlying comorbid condition(s), as well as willingness to undertake treatment and their expected response to treatment. For example, an intraparenchymal pulmonary nodule may be surrounded by large emphysematous bullae or occur in a patient with advanced chronic lung disease. Even if the suspected tumor is localized and potentially curable, risks associated with either percutaneous biopsy or surgical wedge resection may be prohibitively high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-modality-for-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

In general, minimally invasive modalities (eg, endoscopic procedures) are preferred over more invasive modalities (eg, mediastinoscopy) for the initial biopsy. However, in advanced stages, it is critical that the biopsy provide both histopathologic and molecular characterization. More than one procedure will sometimes be necessary. The selection of a second biopsy procedure should favor modalities that are more likely to yield large volume samples. The procedures used to biopsy suspected NSCLC are discussed in detail separately.

The goal of such protocols is the provision of evidence-based care for patients with suspected NSCLC that aligned with the expertise and availability of modalities at the institution. All suggested approaches, including the one proposed below, should be tailored to the individual patient according to risk, benefit, and patient preferences.

The target for biopsy should be selected based upon an initial evaluation consisting of a detailed history, physical examination, routine laboratory studies and imaging with chest computed tomography (CT). The approach should be tailored to the individual patient according to risk, benefit, patient preferences, and available expertise. (See <a href=\"#H174238986\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3800698\" class=\"local\">'Biopsy goals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients with suspected NSCLC, biopsy of the lung, lymph node, or distant organ should aim to provide enough material for histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular assessment. Clinicians should aim to diagnose and stage NSCLC with a single procedure or the minimal number of invasive procedures if more than one is required. (See <a href=\"#H3800712\" class=\"local\">'Adequate biopsy size'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3800705\" class=\"local\">'Efficient diagnosis and procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with suspected NSCLC should undergo CT of the chest (preferably contrast-enhanced) including the liver and adrenal glands prior to biopsy. In addition, whole body 18-fluoro-2 deoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) or integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> can be helpful in select populations such as those being considered for surgical resection. These imaging tests provide the basis for the initial assessment of the tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109806\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109806 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110964\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110964 \">table 6</a>) of disease and guide the clinician toward choosing the optimal biopsy site and biopsy method.

When EBUS-TBNA (with or without EUS-FNA) confirms NSCLC and the specimen is adequate for molecular analysis, no further diagnostic or staging workup is necessary, provided the clinician is confident that this is the highest stage. When EBUS-TBNA (with or without EUS-FNA) is negative or inconclusive, mediastinoscopy or intraoperative mediastinal lymph node systematic sampling or dissection is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H814392\" class=\"local\">'EBUS/EUS needle aspiration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>In patients with suspected NSCLC who are not suitable candidates for <span class=\"nowrap\">EBUS-TBNA/EUS-FNA</span> or in whom <span class=\"nowrap\">EBUS-TBNA/EUS-FNA</span> is inconclusive, an alternative modality (usually mediastinoscopy) is selected based upon procedure availability, institutional expertise, and patient-specific factors. (See <a href=\"#H814399\" class=\"local\">'Alternative modalities'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The exception for mediastinal sampling is patients with suspected NSCLC who have radiologic evidence on CT of bulky disease infiltrating the mediastinum; radiologic imaging is considered acceptable for the assessment of disease stage and the primary goal of biopsy is to confirm the diagnosis while minimizing the risk of procedure-related complications. (See <a href=\"#H2014260351\" class=\"local\">'High risk N2 or N3 nodal involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with suspected NSCLC in whom isolated or multiple metastases (M1a, M1b, M1c) or in whom scalene or supraclavicular node involvement (N3) is suspected, invasive sampling of these sites, rather than sampling of the primary tumor, is indicated for pathological confirmation of advanced disease. When radiographic evidence is overwhelming for multiple sites of metastases, choosing the safest or easiest approach for pathologic confirmation of suspected NSCLC is preferred.
