Whereas classic systemic PAN commonly affects the kidneys, joints, muscles, nerves, and gastrointestinal tract, as well as the skin, vasculitis in cPAN is skin-limited. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sometimes called &quot;benign cutaneous PAN,&quot; cPAN can nevertheless result in significant morbidity due to painful skin nodules, digital infarcts, ulcerations, and other complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109997%7EDERM%2F75391%7EDERM%2F64023%7EDERM%2F75828%7EDERM%2F110003\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109997 graphicRef75391 graphicRef64023 graphicRef75828 graphicRef110003 \">picture 1A-E</a>). Mild systemic symptoms, which must be distinguished from systemic vasculitis, may also develop. </p><p>The cutaneous manifestations of cPAN and systemic PAN are similar; therefore, all patients with cPAN should be evaluated for systemic involvement at the time of diagnosis. In addition, patients with cPAN should be monitored closely over time for progression to systemic PAN. Progression of cPAN to systemic PAN is rare but has been reported. </p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of cPAN will be reviewed here. Systemic PAN and the general approach to the diagnosis of vasculitis are reviewed separately.

A series of 79 patients revealed a female-to-male ratio of 1.7:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], while two smaller series also found elevated rates of cPAN among women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The disease most commonly presents in individuals in their 40s and 50s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], though children also can be affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2806421923\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology and pathogenesis of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) are unknown. Given the varied clinical manifestations of systemic and single-organ disease, &quot;polyarteritis nodosa&quot; may represent a spectrum of disease without a single pathophysiologic explanation. In some cases, immune complex deposition may be important. Deposition of C3 and immunoglobulin M (IgM) in vessel walls has been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], as have IgM anti-phosphatidylserine-prothrombin complex antibodies, which may play a role in complement activation, vessel injury, and thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. How immune complex deposition leads to inflammation of medium-sized arteries but mostly spares the smaller vessels affected in other types of immune complex-mediated vasculitis is unclear; other pathophysiologic mechanisms likely play a role.</p><p>Mural inflammation of involved medium-sized arteries in PAN leads to luminal narrowing and thrombosis, as well as aneurysmal dilation and rupture. The resulting ischemia leads to downstream tissue damage and necrosis. In the case of the skin, manifestations such as tender subcutaneous nodules, retiform purpura, ulceration, and infarction result.</p><p>cPAN is most often idiopathic. An associated medical condition has been suggested in perhaps 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], including various infections, autoimmune diseases, and medications. Examples include Group A <em>Streptococcus</em> infection (most common) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/5,12-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12-17</a>], hepatitis B virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>], hepatitis C virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], recurrent urinary tract infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], parvovirus B19 infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </em>infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/6,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,23</a>], inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/5,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,24-26</a>], and long-term exposure to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minocycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minocycline</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-32</a>].</p><p>Recessive loss-of-function mutations in <em>CECR1</em>, the gene encoding adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2), a growth factor that is the major extracellular adenosine deaminase, have been linked to a PAN-like vasculitis with onset in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. These findings suggest a genetic susceptibility in some patients with cPAN and may shed further light on the pathophysiology of the disease.

These findings are generally indicative of medium vessel vasculitis and include tender subcutaneous nodules, livedo reticularis, retiform purpura, cutaneous ulceration, digital infarction, and necrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109997%7EDERM%2F75391%7EDERM%2F64023%7EDERM%2F75828%7EDERM%2F110003\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109997 graphicRef75391 graphicRef64023 graphicRef75828 graphicRef110003 \">picture 1A-E</a>). </p><p>The majority of patients with cPAN present with tender 0.5 to 2 cm subcutaneous nodules and livedo reticularis as initial manifestations, and approximately half develop cutaneous ulcerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patchy, focal livedo reticularis in a &quot;starburst&quot; pattern is considered typical (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109997\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109997 \">picture 1A</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. cPAN most often affects the legs (97 percent of patients), followed by the arms (33 percent), and the trunk (8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/5,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,35</a>].</p><p>In addition to cutaneous findings, patients with cPAN are also frequently reported to develop extracutaneous manifestations such as fever (9 to 30 percent), arthralgias (9 to 69 percent), myalgias (27 to 31 percent), and peripheral neuropathy (22 to 32 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/3,5-7,11,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5-7,11,35</a>]. Such symptoms are typically mild and transient, in contrast to the more significant extracutaneous symptoms seen in systemic PAN. Some authors have suggested that muscle and nerve symptoms in cPAN are secondary to focal skin damage and should be localized to areas of skin lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>In all, more than 60 percent of patients with cPAN are reported to develop extracutaneous symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/6,7,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,35</a>]. Their presence makes distinguishing between cutaneous and systemic PAN more difficult. Systemic PAN typically presents with systemic symptoms (eg, fatigue, weight loss, fever, arthralgias) and signs of multisystem involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F53997\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53997 \">table 1</a>), such as hypertension, renal insufficiency, mononeuritis multiplex, and abdominal pain, as well as skin lesions (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa in adults&quot;</a>). True cases of cPAN should exhibit neither visceral manifestations of vasculitis nor muscle or nerve symptoms separate from skin lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1883282959\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Characteristic histologic findings of cPAN include inflammation and destruction of medium-sized arteries near the junction of the dermis and subcutis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F110859\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110859 \">picture 2</a>). A brisk inflammatory infiltrate composed primarily of neutrophils and lymphocytes and, in perhaps one-third of cases, eosinophils, infiltrates the vascular and perivascular tissue, obscuring the vessel border. Hyalinization of the vessel wall, with fibrinoid necrosis and narrowing, thrombosis, or obliteration of the vascular lumen, is seen. Disruption of the internal elastic lamina may be apparent on standard hematoxylin and eosin staining or highlighted with the help of an elastin stain. Surrounding smaller vessels, as well as nearby fat lobules, may be secondarily inflamed. In older lesions, fibrosis and neovascularization are seen, while inflammation may be less marked. It may be necessary to cut serial sections in order to identify the involved artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/5,14,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14,35</a>]. </p><p>Direct immunofluorescence, if performed, may be positive for C3 and immunoglobulin M (IgM) in vessel walls, but these findings are variable and do not aid in distinguishing cPAN from systemic PAN or other vasculitides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2311281893\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with other types of vasculitis, careful clinicopathologic correlation is essential for the diagnosis of cPAN. In a patient with skin lesions suspicious for polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) (eg, subcutaneous nodules with livedo reticularis), a biopsy or biopsies should be performed and the results interpreted in the context of the clinical presentation. Once a diagnosis of medium vessel vasculitis is established in the skin, systemic organ involvement must be carefully ruled out. In addition, clinical and serologic clues should be sought to help confirm the specific type of vasculitis.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-adults-with-cutaneous-lesions-of-vasculitis#H16171984\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of adults with cutaneous lesions of vasculitis&quot;, section on 'Clinical assessment'</a> and <a href=\"#H2806421923\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1537854142\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A skin biopsy of suspected PAN must be of adequate size and depth to sample medium-sized vessels in the deep dermis and subcutis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This can be accomplished with an incisional biopsy, a deep punch biopsy, or a &quot;telescoping&quot; punch biopsy (also called the &quot;double-trephine&quot; technique) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In a telescoping punch biopsy, a larger punch tool (eg, 6 mm diameter) is used to sample the epidermis and dermis, and a smaller punch (eg, 4 mm diameter) is used to acquire a deeper portion of subcutaneous fat within the resulting skin defect. Whichever technique is utilized, failure to submit a sufficient amount of subcutaneous tissue for review may lead to false negative results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/3,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,36,37</a>]. When nondiagnostic, skin biopsies may need to be repeated. (See <a href=\"#H1883282959\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-biopsy-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skin biopsy techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Selection of the biopsy site is also important. In general, biopsy of a relatively &quot;fresh&quot; or new vasculitic lesion is most likely to show representative histologic changes. The biopsy should be centered over a tender nodule or purpuric lesion. If a PAN-associated ulcer is biopsied, ideally the central part of the ulcer should be sampled, along with the adjacent ulcer border and normal skin, taking care that an adequate amount of the subcutis is obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>A biopsy for direct immunofluorescence is unlikely to provide additional useful information and is therefore not routinely recommended in cases of suspected PAN.

However, patients in whom clinical and skin biopsy findings suggest PAN should have laboratory studies to assess for features suggestive of systemic involvement. The basic laboratory workup includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basic metabolic panel</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver function tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinalysis with microscopic evaluation</p><p/><p>Of note, mild anemia is fairly common in cPAN, affecting roughly 30 percent of patients. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/5,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,35</a>]. In addition, a normal urinalysis without hematuria or proteinuria does not rule out medium vessel vasculitis of the kidneys, which typically results in renovascular hypertension, not glomerulonephritis. Abnormalities in creatinine or liver function tests may suggest more significant involvement of renal or hepatic vessels with resulting end-organ damage. </p><p>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is the most frequent laboratory abnormality (elevated in 60 to 70 percent of patients with cPAN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/5,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,35</a>]; however the value of this test in the setting of cPAN is unclear. Elevation of ESR or C-reactive protein (CRP) does not necessarily signify the presence of systemic disease, nor does a normal value rule it out. </p><p>Additional tests are recommended to evaluate for other types of vasculitis that can affect medium-sized vessels. The following studies are indicated for all patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antinuclear antibodies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rheumatoid factor (RF)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum cryoglobulins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complement components (C3 and C4) </p><p/><p>These studies are typically <span class=\"nowrap\">normal/negative</span> in PAN but are helpful for evaluating for ANCA-associated vasculitis (ANCA), cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (RF, cryoglobulins, complement levels), and rheumatoid vasculitis (RF).

Cutaneous findings more typical of small vessel vasculitis (eg, palpable purpura) or characteristic systemic symptoms (eg, sinusitis) and laboratory findings (eg, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody [ANCA] or rheumatoid factor positivity) help differentiate these diseases.

Flares of tender nodules, ulcers, and other lesions may be painful and take many weeks or months to resolve. While systemic symptoms, such as arthralgias, fever, and malaise, are generally mild, complications such as ulceration or digital infarction and autoamputation can have a significant impact on quality of life. Secondary infections and treatment-related side effects can also be significant.</p><p>Patients initially diagnosed with cPAN have been reported to develop systemic complications such as renal, testicular, and cardiac polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) years after the initial diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Some reports may be complicated by issues of case definition; accurately differentiating cPAN from systemic PAN can be difficult. </p><p>The incidence of progression to systemic PAN is unclear. Development of systemic disease has been reported to occur in up to 10 percent of patients based upon a study in which 2 of 20 patients with cPAN developed systemic medium vessel vasculitis 18 and 19 years, respectively, after their initial diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, other case series suggest progression from cutaneous to systemic disease is rare. In cohorts of 79 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], 22 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and 22 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] patients, respectively, with average follow-up ranging from three to seven years, no patients initially diagnosed with cPAN went on to develop visceral disease. Because of the uncertainty regarding risk for progression to systemic PAN, long-term follow-up is essential. (See <a href=\"#H1100070061\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1439178942\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because vasculitis in cPAN is skin-limited, therapeutic decisions should be tailored to the severity of the cutaneous manifestations and associated symptoms. Limited data are available to guide the management of cPAN. No prospective trial has been performed, and no specific regimen can be confidently recommended. The treatment suggestions provided here for various clinical presentations are based upon case reports, small case series, and expert opinion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2913029977\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild cPAN manifesting primarily with subcutaneous nodules and livedo reticularis may improve with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), rest, and elevation of the affected limb(s) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/3,15,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15,26</a>].

In our experience, colchicine and dapsone yield greater improvement than NSAIDs. Therefore, we treat most patients with one of these agents.

Dapsone can cause hemolytic anemia and should be avoided in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency because of risk for severe hemolytic anemia.

Glucocorticoid-sparing agents are often added in an attempt to improve control and minimize the risk of glucocorticoid-induced side effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> of 30 mg per day or less may be sufficient for many adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/3,7,41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,41-43</a>]. However, higher doses (eg, 60 to 80 mg or 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of prednisone daily) should be given in the presence of more significant features such as severe ulceration or digital ischemia or when the response to lower doses is insufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/5,8,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,14,15</a>]. </p><p>Once disease activity is controlled, the dose of glucocorticoids should be tapered slowly over a period of months, ranging from two to several depending on disease severity and the maximum dose required to achieve control. In some patients, the disease remits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], but in others it flares with taper [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and the adverse effects of chronic glucocorticoid therapy become dose-limiting. A glucocorticoid-sparing agent should be initiated if the disease flares with attempted glucocorticoid taper. Alternatively, one can be added at the time of initial therapy, especially for patients at high risk for glucocorticoid-related toxicities. Once remission has been achieved, the glucocorticoid taper can be resumed, and the glucocorticoid-sparing agent can be continued as long as it is tolerated and necessary to maintain disease control. </p><p>Nonimmunosuppressive glucocorticoid-sparing agents can be tried first unless disease manifestations are severe; benefit from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>, sulfapyridine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a> has been described in case reports or case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-polyarteritis-nodosa/abstract/3,12,13,15,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12,13,15,44</a>]. Absent high-quality data to guide management, the choice of a particular glucocorticoid-sparing agent depends on several factors, including disease severity, clinician experience or comfort, and patient preference or comorbidities. Our initial choices for glucocorticoid-sparing therapy are typically colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) or dapsone (50 to 150 mg per day), agents commonly used for other forms of cutaneous vasculitis. Patients who achieve only partial control or who remain glucocorticoid-dependent despite use of nonimmunosuppressive glucocorticoid-sparing agents may benefit from a switch to, or the addition of, an immunosuppressive glucocorticoid-sparing agent.

It closely resembles classic systemic polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) with respect to its cutaneous presentation but lacks the serious visceral complications of that disease. The diagnosis is most common in women in their 40s and 50s. (See <a href=\"#H3501516621\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3621857745\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most cases of cPAN are idiopathic, but various infectious, autoimmune, and medication triggers have been described. The pathogenesis of the disease is poorly understood. Mural inflammation of medium-sized arteries leads to luminal narrowing and thrombosis, as well as aneurysmal dilation and rupture, with resulting downstream ischemic damage and necrosis. (See <a href=\"#H2806421923\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with cPAN typically present with 0.5 to 2 cm tender subcutaneous nodules and livedo reticularis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109997%7EDERM%2F75391%7EDERM%2F64023%7EDERM%2F75828%7EDERM%2F110003\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109997 graphicRef75391 graphicRef64023 graphicRef75828 graphicRef110003 \">picture 1A-E</a>). Approximately half develop cutaneous ulcerations. Retiform purpura, necrosis, and digital ischemia also occur. The legs are involved in nearly all cases, followed by the arms in one-third and, less commonly, the trunk. Patients may also develop mild systemic symptoms, including fever and arthralgias, as well as myalgias and peripheral neuropathy localized to areas of skin involvement. (See <a href=\"#H885760525\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a patient with skin lesions suspicious for cPAN, a biopsy or biopsies should be performed with adequate sampling of the deep dermis and subcutis, where medium-sized cutaneous vessels reside (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F110859\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110859 \">picture 2</a>). Biopsy findings should be interpreted in the context of the clinical presentation. No specific serologic test exists to aid in the diagnosis of cPAN. (See <a href=\"#H1883282959\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2311281893\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important differential diagnosis of cPAN is systemic PAN, which may present identically in the skin but has a much less favorable prognosis due to the potential for renal, neurologic, gastrointestinal, cardiac, and other systemic manifestations. Because of the potential for misdiagnosis and, rarely, for disease evolution over time, evaluation for systemic disease should be careful and complete, and patients with presumed cPAN should be monitored over time. (See <a href=\"#H1299950481\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H973027043\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1100070061\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited data exist to guide the treatment of cPAN. Patients with mild cPAN manifesting as subcutaneous nodules and livedo reticularis can often be managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nonimmunosuppressive agents with activity in cutaneous vasculitis (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>). Rest and elevation of the affected limb(s) also may help to relieve symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H1439178942\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with acute disease flares, ulceration, or extracutaneous symptoms, we suggest systemic glucocorticoids as initial therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Initiation of a glucocorticoid-sparing agent is indicated either at the time of initial therapy or if the disease flares upon tapering of the systemic glucocorticoid.
