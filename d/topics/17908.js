The granulomas may occur in any organ, but the most frequently affected sites are the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, eyes, and liver. Patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis typically present without symptoms, but with an abnormal chest radiograph obtained for an unrelated reason. When symptomatic, patients usually report dyspnea, cough, or nonspecific chest discomfort. Spontaneous resolution of the disease is common, but progressive and disabling organ failure can occur in up to 10 percent of patients.</p><p>Glucocorticoids are the most commonly used medication for the treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis, although no medications have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-disease-refractory-to-glucocorticoid-therapy/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. However, some patients with sarcoidosis cannot tolerate or do not respond to glucocorticoids. Several alternative approaches have been proposed, such as the use of immunosuppressive, cytotoxic, and antimalarial drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-disease-refractory-to-glucocorticoid-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, irradiation has been used for neurosarcoidosis and organ transplantation has been performed successfully for end-stage hepatic, renal, cardiac, or pulmonary disease complicating sarcoidosis. Unfortunately, limited data exist regarding the indications and efficacy of these approaches in the management of pulmonary sarcoidosis.</p><p>The treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis with alternatives to glucocorticoids will be reviewed here. The diagnosis, treatment approach, and use of glucocorticoids for sarcoidosis affecting the lungs and other organs are discussed separately.

For these patients, intensification of therapy with alternatives to glucocorticoids typically involves immunosuppressive agents. Other patients may be intolerant of glucocorticoids and require immunosuppressive therapy in that basis. Many of these patients may benefit from referral to a sarcoidosis center.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with sarcoidosis who may benefit from agents other than, or in addition to, glucocorticoids generally have one or more of the following features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progression of the disease despite adequate glucocorticoid therapy. An adequate trial of glucocorticoid therapy is considered to be a minimum of 10 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> daily (or its equivalent) for at least three months (the usual initial dose is prednisone 20 to 40 mg daily, or its equivalent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-disease-refractory-to-glucocorticoid-therapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intolerable glucocorticoid side effects (eg, difficult to control diabetes mellitus, excessive weight gain, myopathy, osteoporosis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need for a glucocorticoid-sparing agent in a patient who requires long-term glucocorticoid therapy, has been unable to taper below 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> and has had at least one documented problem with glucocorticoid toxicity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient refusal to take glucocorticoids. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2665498984\"><span class=\"h2\">Pretreatment assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to intensifying therapy for pulmonary sarcoidosis, we investigate possible reasons for lack of clinical improvement, such as noncompliance with systemic glucocorticoids, comorbid disease, and end-stage fibrosis.</p><p>Noncompliance with glucocorticoid therapy is common, due to the numerous side effects of glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-disease-refractory-to-glucocorticoid-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Sometimes patients will admit on questioning that they have been missing doses due to fear about the potential side effects. This is helpful information when assessing the likelihood of a response to another potentially toxic agent. </p><p>We also assess patients for comorbid diseases that may contribute to their symptoms, pulmonary function impairment, or radiographic abnormalities (eg, infection, heart failure, thromboembolic disease, pulmonary hypertension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-disease-refractory-to-glucocorticoid-therapy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Testing typically includes repeat pulmonary function tests (PFTs), a high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan, and often an echocardiogram. Dyspnea that is out of proportion to the spirometric findings or a diffusing capacity that is lower than expected based on the amount of interstitial disease on chest imaging might suggest pulmonary hypertension or thromboembolic disease. This is also a good time to ask the patient again about possible occupational exposure to beryllium or any exposures that could cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-beryllium-disease-berylliosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic beryllium disease (berylliosis)&quot;, section on 'Exposure'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-hypertension-due-to-lung-disease-and-or-hypoxemia-group-3-pulmonary-hypertension-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnostic-evaluation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary hypertension due to lung disease and/or hypoxemia (group 3 pulmonary hypertension): Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnostic evaluation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>End-stage lung fibrosis is not responsive to immunosuppressive therapy, so it is important to determine whether a patient with apparently refractory disease has end-stage fibrosis or refractory but active inflammation. Chest imaging is not precise enough in most patients to exclude the presence of active disease in a severely scarred lung. On the other hand, PFT abnormalities that have been stable for a few years are more likely due to fibrosis than active inflammation, although the stability of PFT abnormalities does not entirely exclude reversibility. If it is uncertain whether the patient has end-stage fibrosis without active disease, one or two second-line immunosuppressive agents are often tried before deciding that the patient has stable fibrosis and is not in need of ongoing therapy. Patients with advanced lung disease may be candidates for lung transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H3018260938\" class=\"local\">'Lung transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7493424\"><span class=\"h2\">Agent selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The agents that appear to have the greatest likelihood of benefit in pulmonary sarcoidosis with an acceptable side effect profile are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) antagonists show promise. Randomized trial data to guide selection among the agents are lacking. All of these agents carry substantial risk for toxicity, particularly myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, and opportunistic infection. The specific toxicities and ways to reduce their impact should be carefully reviewed with the patient.</p><p>MTX is the most commonly used second-line agent, although it cannot be used in patients with underlying liver disease. Patients who fail or do not tolerate MTX are commonly transitioned to another second-line immunosuppressive agent. Occasionally, two agents are used in combination, such as MTX and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a>. </p><p>If none of the second-line agents, alone or in combination, is effective, the next step is often a TNF-a antagonist, usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>. Data are insufficient to determine whether a second-line agent (eg, MTX) should be used during TNF-a antagonist therapy. Combination therapy (eg, TNF-a inhibitor with MTX) has been used in rheumatoid arthritis to improve efficacy and reduce the risk of development of antibodies to the TNF-a inhibitor, but has not been formally evaluated in sarcoidosis and is associated with increased risk of infection and possibly malignancy.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis-initial-therapy-with-glucocorticoids#H348701692\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis: Initial therapy with glucocorticoids&quot;, section on 'Assessing the response'</a>.)</p><p>The parameters of response are sometimes conflicting and clinical judgment is needed to determine whether changes reflect true worsening or true improvement. Generally, greater weight is attributed to changes in symptoms than to changes in other parameters.</p><p>In addition to assessing the response to therapy, patients are monitored for new, extrapulmonary manifestations of sarcoidosis on a regular basis. An approach to monitoring is presented separately.

However, patients on a combination of glucocorticoids (&ge;20 mg daily) and another immunosuppressive agent (eg, MTX, azathioprine, leflunomide, TNF-a antagonist) do appear to be at some increased risk and clinicians need to be aware of this possibility.
