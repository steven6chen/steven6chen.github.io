Ligaments are tough bands of tissue that connect bones to other bones.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fractures &ndash; A &quot;fracture&quot; is another word for a broken bone. There are different kinds of wrist fractures. Some wrist fractures involve a break in one of the small bones in the wrist. Others involve a break in one of the forearm bones near the wrist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69018\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69018 \">figure 1</a>). One common type of wrist fracture is called a &quot;Colles' fracture.&quot; This fracture involves the end of one of the forearm bones. It can happen when a person falls onto his or her outstretched hand.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27926784\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a wrist injury?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wrist injuries can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bruising</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stiffness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness in the wrist or arm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The arm or wrist to look bent</p><p/><p>Sprains usually cause less pain and swelling than fractures, but not always.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27926799\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. To check for a fracture, he or she will do an X-ray. He or she might also do an imaging test such as a CT or MRI scan. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27926813\"><span class=\"h1\">How are wrist injuries treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the type of injury you have and how severe it is.</p><p>If you have a lot of pain or a severe injury, your doctor will prescribe a strong pain medicine. If your injury is mild, your doctor might recommend that you take an over-the-counter medicine for your pain. Over-the-counter medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p>Treatment for a wrist sprain can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resting your wrist</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting ice on your wrist &ndash; To reduce swelling, you can put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the injured area every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. You should put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin. You should use the ice (or other cold object) for at least 6 hours after your injury. Some people find it helpful to ice longer, even up to 2 days after their injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing an elastic bandage (such as an ACE wrap) or splint</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Most people with a wrist sprain do not need surgery. But people who tore a ligament might need surgery to fix the ligament.</p><p/><p>A wrist fracture is usually treated with a splint or cast. But your doctor might wait for your swelling to get better before he or she puts the cast on your wrist. Swelling usually gets better in a few days. While you wait for the swelling to get better, your doctor will probably have you wear a splint.</p><p>Before your doctor puts the cast on your wrist, he or she will make sure that your bone is in the correct position. If your bone is not in the correct position, your doctor might do a procedure or surgery to put your bone in the correct position.</p><p>After your cast or splint comes off, your doctor might recommend that you see a physical therapist (exercise expert). The physical therapist can show you exercises and stretches to make your muscles stronger and help your joints move more easily.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27926828\"><span class=\"h1\">How long do wrist injuries take to heal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends partly on the type of injury and how severe it is. A mild sprain takes about 1 to 2 weeks to heal. Fractures can take weeks to months to heal.</p><p>It also depends on the person. Healthy children usually heal very quickly. Older adults or adults with other medical problems can take much longer to heal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27926843\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything to improve the healing process?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions while your sprain or fracture is healing. He or she will probably recommend that you eat a healthy diet that includes getting enough calcium, vitamin D, and protein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79375 \">figure 2</a>). He or she will also probably recommend that you avoid doing certain things. For example, he or she might recommend that you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid doing certain physical activities.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid smoking &ndash; A fracture can take longer to heal if you smoke.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid damaging your cast or getting it wet, if you have a cast that shouldn't get wet.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27926858\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will tell you when to call him or her. In general, you should call your doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have severe pain, or your pain or swelling gets worse.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have numbness or tingling in your fingers, or your fingers look blue or purple.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You damage your cast or get it wet, and it's not supposed to get wet.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27926873\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fractures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cast-and-splint-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cast and splint care (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventing-falls-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preventing falls (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cast-and-splint-care-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Cast and splint care (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
