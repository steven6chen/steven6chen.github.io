These are chronic bacterial infections caused by organisms that are morphologically and serologically indistinguishable from <em>Treponema pallidum </em>subsp<em> pallidum</em>, which is the causative organism of venereal syphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. However, they can be differentiated by the clinical manifestations of their respective diseases, by geographic distribution, and by identification of minor genetic differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Yaws and bejel affect skin and bones; pinta affects the skin only.

Disease was even eliminated in some regions; bejel was eliminated in Bosnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and yaws was eliminated in Malaysia and Brazil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>Disease began to reemerge in the late 1970s. A World Health Assembly Resolution renewed efforts to eradicate yaws in 1978, although endemic treponematoses were generally not prioritized in many regions, and surveillance and reporting have been sporadic; an exception is the WHO South Asia region, which kept yaws on its agenda [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There is growing evidence in the literature that the number of cases continues to increase in some countries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12097691\"><span class=\"h2\">Geographic distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nonvenereal treponematoses are endemic in rural areas among communities living in overcrowded conditions with poor hygiene (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F88814\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88814 \">figure 1</a>). Imported cases of yaws and bejel have been reported among children in Europe and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>].</p><p>Yaws is the most prevalent nonvenereal treponematosis. Data available from a number of endemic countries demonstrate that yaws is endemic mainly in warm, humid equatorial regions of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Paci&#64257;c (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F88760\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88760 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/16-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-30</a>]. Elimination of yaws has been reported in Ecuador [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]; additional data on yaws in the Americas are limited. West Africa is an important reservoir for yaws, particularly in Ghana (18,702 cases in 2013) and Cote d&rsquo;Ivoire (2256 cases in 2013). There is also a growing number of cases in the Pacific region, including Papua New Guinea (19,710 cases in 2013), the Solomon Islands (14,909 cases in 2013), and Indonesia (2043 cases in 2013). Reporting of yaws is not mandatory; these figures likely reflect underreporting. India reported elimination of yaws in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], and the WHO officially declared India free of yaws in May 2016.</p><p>Bejel occurs mainly in the arid areas of the Sahel (southern border of the Sahara desert), including Senegal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], Burkina Faso [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], Mali [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], and Niger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In these areas, high rates of seropositivity (10 to 20 percent of children under 15 years) have been reported. Bejel has also been described among the nomadic people of the Arabian Peninsula (Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Syria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. There was a report of three cases of bejel in Turkey in 1995 (where the disease was considered to be eliminated) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], as well as a case report from Iran in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Data on the prevalence of pinta are limited; there is the perception that the disease has sustained a marked decline over the past century. Pinta might remain endemic in remote regions of Mexico (states of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoacan, and Chiapas) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>] and Central and South America (among Indian tribes in the Amazon region of Brazil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], Colombia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], Venezuela [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], and Peru [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]). A survey in Panama in the 1980s noted evidence of active or inactive pinta among 20 percent of the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12097724\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yaws and bejel usually occur in children; 65 to 75 percent of new cases arise in individuals under the age of 15 years, and children are the primary reservoir of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. The age range for pinta is 15 to 50 years (median 30 to 34 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Yaws is transmitted by direct skin-to-skin, nonsexual contact with infectious lesions. Because <em>T. p. pertenue</em> is temperature and humidity dependent, the incidence of skin lesions is higher in the wet season; high humidity promotes exuberant growth of papillomata and survival of treponemes in serous exudates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Transmission may be facilitated by a breach in the skin of the recipient, such as a scratch or insect bite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The disease may be clustered in households, but transmission also occurs between children in the community, schools, and other public places [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Bejel is transmitted by direct skin-to-skin or mouth-to-mouth contact and by indirect contact through infected communal eating or drinking utensils (this is supported by a study demonstrating treponemes on a drinking flask) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/8,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,54</a>]. Initial lesions are often in or around the mouth; infection can be spread by older children kissing younger siblings.</p><p>Pinta is transmitted by direct skin-to-skin contact. It has been demonstrated that inoculation of fluid from a pinta lesion can reproduce skin lesions in volunteers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Transmission is thought to occur frequently within families; in the absence of infection among adults in a household, the likelihood of infection among children is extremely low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Indirect transmission of endemic treponematoses by nonbiting flies has been suggested on the basis that <em>Musca</em> spp could transmit yaws to monkeys in the laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/52,55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,55,56</a>]. Molecular studies have demonstrated that wild-caught flies from a yaws-endemic setting harbor <em>T. pallidum</em> DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>] but could not demonstrate that fly-associated bacteria were viable and present in sufficient numbers for transmission.</p><p>A yaws-like treponeme has been identified in nonhuman primates in Africa (17 percent of a wild gorilla population in the Republic of Congo) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>], and experimental inoculation of humans with a simian isolate has been shown to cause skin lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. However, there is no evidence of transmission between humans and primates in the literature or of increased infection in countries where frequent encounters between humans and monkeys occur. It is unclear whether baboons can serve as a reservoir for human infection and, if so, how yaws could be transmitted from baboons to humans.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12097753\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causative organisms of endemic treponematoses include <em>Treponema pallidum </em>subsp<em> pertenue </em>(yaws), <em>T. pallidum </em>subsp<em> endemicum</em> (bejel), and <em>T. carateum</em> (pinta). <em>T. pallidum </em>belongs to a family of gram-negative spiral-shaped bacteria, the Spirochaetaceae,<em> </em>and has a length ranging from 10 to 15 microns and a diameter of 0.2 microns, making it invisible to light microscopy except under dark field illumination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. Electron microscope studies have shown that there are not significant differences in morphology or structure between <em>T. pallidum </em>subspecies<em> </em>or with<em> T. carateum</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>].</p><p>The bacteria<em> </em>are easily killed by drying, elevated temperature, and exposure to oxygen. The organisms multiply slowly (once every 30 to 33 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>] and cannot survive outside the mammalian host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Since <em>T. pallidum</em> species cannot be grown in culture, testing for antibiotic resistance is difficult and can be done only by experimental infection of animals or indirect molecular methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>In vitro susceptibility data for the endemic treponematoses are scant. Assays that have been used to examine the susceptibility of <em>T. pallidum </em>to antimicrobial agents include testing for loss of motility, inhibition of protein synthesis, and inhibition of growth of avirulent species, but these are all laborious and technically challenging assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>An in vitro assay to assess the effect of antibiotics on treponemal protein synthesis, as measured by the incorporation of radiolabeled <sup>35</sup>S-methionine, demonstrated sensitivity of <em>T. p. pallidum </em>and <em>T. p. pertenue</em> to penicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

In the hamster model, the rate of appearance and resolution of cutaneous lesions varies with the size of the inoculum, and the minimum infective dose has been estimated to be 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup> bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>].</p><p>After invasion, the organisms appear in lymph nodes within minutes and disseminate widely within hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Treponemes exhibit characteristic corkscrew motility due to endoflagella [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>], with rapid rotation about the longitudinal axis, and are able to swim efficiently in a gel-like environment such as connective tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. This virulence factor plays a role in the widespread dissemination of treponemal infections and the establishment of chronic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>In the face of a hostile host environment and a strong specific immune response (including macrophage phagocytosis due to opsonization) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/75,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,79</a>], the bacterium utilizes several survival mechanisms. <em>T. pallidum</em> may stimulate trafficking of T cells out of the peripheral blood circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>]. The organism may also exploit its low metabolic rate in order to maintain infection with very few viable cells, avoiding the stimulation of an immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Antigenic variation in candidate outer membrane protein antigenic targets (eg, TprK) may be important in immune evasion and persistence of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3623326333\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>New skin lesions are rarely found in adults, suggesting that immunity to reinfection can develop in humans. Studies in the experimental model designed to identify resistance to infection and immunological correlates of resistance suggest that acquired resistance to the yaws bacteria can develop in untreated animals and persist after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12097812\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whole genome analysis for several pathogenic treponemes has been performed, and several genetic differences between <em>T. p. pallidum</em>, <em>T. p. pertenue</em>,<em> </em>and<em> T. p. endemicum</em> have been identified. The regions of sequence divergence could be used for the molecular detection and discrimination of syphilis, yaws, and bejel strains, which is not possible with the available diagnostic tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/4,12,85-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12,85-91</a>]. The overall sequence identity between <em>T. p. pallidum</em> and <em>T. p. pertenue</em> genomes is 99.8 percent, but several genomic regions differ between these subspecies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/5,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,92</a>]. The Fribourg-Blanc simian isolate shows changes similar to <em>T. p. pertenue</em> strains, suggesting a closer relationship to the pertenue subspecies and, therefore, a possible common origin of these strains.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12097842\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yaws and bejel affect skin and bones; pinta is unique in that it affects the skin only. The skin pathology in endemic treponematoses is largely similar to that of venereal syphilis.</p><p>Early yaws lesions consist of epidermal hyperplasia and papillomatosis, often with focal spongiosis and intraepidermal collections of neutrophils. In contrast with syphilis, skin biopsies from yaws patients show numerous plasma cells in the dermis but few T and B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>], and vascular changes are less marked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>]. The treponemes are found mostly in extracellular clusters in the upper regions of the epidermis, unlike subspecies pallidum, which primarily localizes in the dermis and dermal-epidermal junction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F89033\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89033 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/63,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,96</a>]. These differences are relative, so they cannot be used to differentiate yaws from venereal syphilis.</p><p>The histopathology of bejel closely resembles that of yaws. In early bejel, granulomas consisting of epithelioid cells and multinuclear giant cells may be present, and, similar to primary syphilis, the dermal infiltrate is mainly perivascular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].</p><p>In pinta, there is no ulcer formation comparable with that in yaws [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. In the early lesion, there is loss of melanin in basal cells and liquefaction degeneration. A superficial and perivascular mixed infiltrate primarily composed of lymphocytes and plasma cells develops in the dermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. In the late stage, there is epidermal atrophy and many melanophages are present in the dermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. Absence of treponemes and inflammatory cells in the achromic lesions are typical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/yaws-bejel-and-pinta/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12097874\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yaws and bejel affect skin and bones; pinta affects the skin only. The clinical manifestations are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F88761\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88761 \">table 2</a>).

Most serologically defined treatment failures are thought to be caused by either reinfection following treatment or slow decline in nontreponemal test titers rather than by relapse or true antibiotic resistance.

These are chronic bacterial infections caused by organisms that are morphologically and serologically indistinguishable from <em>Treponema pallidum </em>subsp<em> pallidum</em>, which is the causative organism of venereal syphilis. They can be differentiated by clinical manifestations and by genetic differences. (See <a href=\"#H12097669\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nonvenereal treponematoses are endemic in rural areas among communities living in overcrowded conditions with poor hygiene. Yaws is the most prevalent nonvenereal treponematosis; it is endemic mainly in warm, humid equatorial regions of Africa, South East Asia, and the Paci&#64257;c. Bejel occurs mainly in the arid areas of the Sahel (southern border of the Sahara desert). Pinta is endemic in remote regions of Central and South America. (See <a href=\"#H12097691\" class=\"local\">'Geographic distribution'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Yaws and bejel usually occur in children; pinta occurs in adolescents and adults. Yaws and pinta are transmitted by direct skin-to-skin, nonsexual contact with infectious lesions. Bejel is transmitted by direct skin-to-skin or mouth-to-mouth contact and by indirect contact through infected communal eating or drinking utensils. (See <a href=\"#H12097724\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Yaws and bejel affect skin and bones; pinta affects the skin only. Treponemes penetrate through the skin and subsequently appear in lymph nodes. Clinical manifestations are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F88761\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88761 \">table 2</a>). Endemic treponematoses can be confused with a number of conditions common in the tropics; the differential diagnosis is summarized above. (See <a href=\"#H12097874\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16741377\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of yaws, bejel, or pinta is established via serology. The serological tests are the same as those used to diagnose syphilis. Existing tests cannot differentiate between endemic treponematoses and syphilis; until more specific assays (such as polymerase chain reaction) are available, diagnosis requires use of serologic tests together with clinical manifestations and epidemiologic and demographic characteristics. (See <a href=\"#H12097984\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nontreponemal agglutination tests (rapid plasma reagin [RPR] or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL]) are positive in untreated patients and can also be used as a test of cure since the quantitative titer declines after successful treatment. Nontreponemal tests become positive within two to four weeks after appearance of the primary lesion. (See <a href=\"#H12098014\" class=\"local\">'Nontreponemal tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For treatment of yaws, we recommend oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> or injectable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-benzathine-long-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G benzathine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For treatment of bejel or pinta, we recommend injectable penicillin G benzathine (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12098050\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be examined four weeks following antibiotic treatment. Yaws and bejel lesions become noninfectious within 24 hours of treatment and, in most cases, complete healing of the primary and secondary lesions is observed within two to four weeks. Skin lesions of pinta heal more slowly after treatment (within 6 to 12 months). Patients should undergo repeat nontreponemal testing at 6 and 12 months after treatment; in most cases, titers decline fourfold within less than one year. (See <a href=\"#H12098087\" class=\"local\">'Patient monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Yaws is a potentially eradicable disease since the diagnosis and treatment are relatively straightforward and there is no significant animal reservoir. The World Health Organization has set a target of 2020 for global eradication of yaws. The approach consists of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> given to entire populations in endemic areas; injectable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-benzathine-long-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G benzathine</a> may be used as an alternative agent. Most communities require two or three rounds of mass treatment to interrupt transmission or ensure significant reduction in prevalence, followed by repeat surveys at four weeks and every six month thereafter to detect and treat remaining cases and their contacts.
