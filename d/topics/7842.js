class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3071298892\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of randomized trials have addressed the issue of goal blood pressure in patients with hypertension. These trials, discussed in detail below, form the rationale for our approach to initial management of hypertension and goal blood pressure.</p><p>In general:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our proposed blood pressure targets depend in part upon the method by which the blood pressure is measured (see <a href=\"#H1244538168\" class=\"local\">'Importance of how blood pressure is measured'</a> below):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In particular, blood pressure may be measured in a standard, routine fashion (usually a single, manual measurement in the office with a stethoscope or oscillometric device) or measured using other methods (automatic oscillometric blood pressure monitoring [AOBPM] performed in the office, home blood pressure monitoring, or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring [ABPM]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Overall, standard, routine measurements provide higher readings than non-routine measurements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, blood pressure targets are based upon the patient's risk for having a future cardiovascular event.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Specifically, we recommend or suggest, depending upon the strength of the evidence, a more intensive goal for most patients with one or more of the following higher-risk characteristics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F117101\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef117101 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H3935306536\" class=\"local\">'Goal blood pressure in higher-risk patients'</a> below):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (prior history of coronary disease, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), or documented peripheral arterial disease) (see <a href=\"#H2941330581\" class=\"local\">'Patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with heart failure (see <a href=\"#H54671266\" class=\"local\">'Patients with heart failure'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patents with diabetes mellitus (see <a href=\"#H2839714254\" class=\"local\">'Patients with diabetes mellitus'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) (see <a href=\"#H3358518579\" class=\"local\">'Patients with chronic kidney disease'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Older adults (&gt;65 years of age) (see <a href=\"#H701751444\" class=\"local\">'Older adults'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors (and an estimated 10-year risk of future cardiovascular events of 10 percent or greater) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-cardiovascular-risk-assessment-in-adults-10-year-acc-aha-2013\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H4104118838\" class=\"local\">'Patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients without any of these characteristics are considered lower risk; we recommend a less intensive goal in such patients.</p><p/><p>There are strong data supporting treatment decisions in some patient populations, such as in those with severely elevated blood pressure, in those at high cardiovascular risk, and in older adults. However, data are weak and largely indirect for many other patient populations. As such, good clinical judgment and shared decision making between patient and provider are paramount.</p><p>The lower blood pressure targets in higher-risk groups are relevant to a large segment of the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/goal-blood-pressure-in-adults-with-hypertension/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Pursuing more intensive blood pressure lowering in such patients is likely to be cost effective, despite the need for more medication and additional monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/goal-blood-pressure-in-adults-with-hypertension/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1244538168\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of how blood pressure is measured</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood pressure targets depend in part upon the method by which the blood pressure is measured (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F117101\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef117101 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>A variety of methods and equipment are used to measure blood pressure in clinical practice; all methods of measurement, in particular routine office measurements, should follow specific standards (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F117101\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef117101 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in adults&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine (traditional) office blood pressure &ndash; Office blood pressure, using either the auscultatory method (ie, with a stethoscope and manual cuff) or an automated oscillometric device, is measured by the care provider and while the care provider is in the room with the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other (non-routine) methods:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Automated oscillometric blood pressure monitoring (AOBPM) &ndash; AOBPM uses an oscillometric device that can be programed to average multiple consecutive readings (typically with the patient sitting alone).

Typically, multiple readings are obtained daily over several consecutive days and then these readings are averaged to guide clinical decision making. A common scenario is to instruct patients to take two to four daily readings for five to seven days before attending the clinic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) &ndash; ABPM is determined using a device (worn by the patient) that takes blood pressure measurements over a 24- to 48-hour period, usually every 15 to 30 minutes during the daytime and every 30 to 60 minutes during sleep.</p><p/><p>The auscultatory method of measurement using a manual cuff is the most common technique employed in clinical practice and, in addition, was the technique used in most clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy.</p><p>By contrast, AOBPM is less frequently employed in clinical practice but was the technique that was used in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) and the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial. Goal blood pressure trials that used home blood pressure measurement or ABPM are lacking.</p><p>On average, systolic pressure readings are 5 to 10 mmHg lower with non-routine than with routine (eg, auscultatory) measurement because the &quot;white coat&quot; effect is absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/goal-blood-pressure-in-adults-with-hypertension/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. Some studies have reported even more dramatic differences between non-routine and routine measurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/goal-blood-pressure-in-adults-with-hypertension/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, it is critical to realize that this average difference in blood pressure depending upon the methodology of measurement applies to the population and <strong>not</strong> the individual. Some patients do not experience a white coat effect, and there is therefore some uncertainty in setting goals according to the method of measurement.

(See <a href=\"#H3935306536\" class=\"local\">'Goal blood pressure in higher-risk patients'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1583879938\" class=\"local\">'Goal blood pressure in lower-risk patients'</a> below.)</p><p>In general, therapeutic decisions should be made based upon the absolute benefits and harms of a particular treatment and <strong>not</strong> the relative benefits and harms. Suppose, for example, that a blood pressure reduction of <span class=\"nowrap\">10/5</span> mmHg produces a 20 percent <strong>relative risk</strong> reduction (ie, a relative risk [RR] of 0.80) for major cardiovascular events. Now suppose there are two hypertensive patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first patient is a 50-year-old, nonsmoking, nondiabetic, African-American woman with a total cholesterol of 190 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol of 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> and a systolic pressure of 135 mmHg. This patient has a predicted 10-year risk of having a major atherosclerotic cardiovascular event of 3 percent (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-cardiovascular-risk-assessment-in-adults-10-year-acc-aha-2013\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second patient is a 50-year-old, diabetic, African-American woman who smokes cigarettes, has a total cholesterol of 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> an HDL cholesterol of 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> and a systolic pressure of 135 mmHg. This patient has a predicted 10-year risk of having a major atherosclerotic cardiovascular event of 20 percent (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-cardiovascular-risk-assessment-in-adults-10-year-acc-aha-2013\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>).</p><p/><p>Usually, the relative risk reduction of a treatment is similar across different patients and populations with different baseline risk. Thus, for both patients presented above, antihypertensive therapy would reduce the <strong>relative risk</strong> of cardiovascular events by 20 percent. However, the first patient would have an <strong>absolute risk</strong> reduction of 0.6 percent (from 3 percent to 2.4 percent), and the second patient would have an <strong>absolute risk</strong> reduction of 4.0 percent (from 20 percent to 16 percent). In a population similar to the first patient, 167 patients would need antihypertensive therapy for 10 years to prevent one major cardiovascular event; in a population similar to the second patient, 25 patients would require therapy for 10 years to prevent one event.</p><p>The conclusion from this hypothetical example, that the absolute benefit from therapy is larger among higher-risk as compared with lower-risk patients despite similar reductions in relative risk, is supported by various studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/goal-blood-pressure-in-adults-with-hypertension/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>As an example, in a 2014 meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials comparing antihypertensive therapy with placebo, patients were risk stratified according to their estimated five-year risk of having a major cardiovascular event (ie, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure) using information in addition to their blood pressure, which included their age, sex, body mass index, and prior history of cardiovascular disease, smoking, and diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/goal-blood-pressure-in-adults-with-hypertension/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The relative risk of major cardiovascular events was significantly reduced by antihypertensive therapy to a similar degree regardless of the overall five-year risk. However, the absolute benefit varied significantly, for example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with the highest overall cardiovascular risk (ie, those with a five-year risk of more than 21 percent), the absolute risk reduction was 3.8 percent (number needed to treat was 26 patients for five years).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with the lowest overall cardiovascular risk (ie, those with a five-year risk of approximately 6 percent), the absolute risk reduction was 1.4 percent (number needed to treat was 71 patients for five years).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3935306536\"><span class=\"h2\">Goal blood pressure in higher-risk patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, a more aggressive blood pressure goal is appropriate for higher-risk patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2941330581\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (prior history of coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral arterial disease), we recommend a goal blood pressure of 125 to <span class=\"nowrap\">130/&lt;80</span> mmHg (using standard, routine clinician office measurements) or 120 to <span class=\"nowrap\">125/&lt;80</span> mmHg (using other methodology including AOBPM, home blood pressure, and ABPM). These types of blood pressure measurements are defined and discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H1244538168\" class=\"local\">'Importance of how blood pressure is measured'</a> above.)</p><p>The best data come from SPRINT, a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial performed in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/goal-blood-pressure-in-adults-with-hypertension/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. SPRINT enrolled 9361 patients aged 50 years or older, more than 90 percent of whom were on antihypertensive therapy, who had a systolic blood pressure of 130 to 180 mmHg. In addition, they had to have one or more of the following additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease: age greater than or equal to 75 years, clinically evident cardiovascular disease (ie, previously documented coronary, peripheral arterial, or cerebrovascular disease [except for stroke]), subclinical cardiovascular disease (ie, an elevated coronary artery calcification score by computed tomography (CT) scan, left ventricular hypertrophy, or an ankle-brachial index &lt;0.9), an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 20 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, or a 10-year Framingham Risk Score greater than or equal to 15 percent. SPRINT excluded patients with diabetes, symptomatic heart failure, a history of stroke, proteinuria (&ge;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> total protein or &ge;600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> albumin), and nursing home residents. The mean age at baseline was 68 years, the mean body mass index was 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> the mean Framingham 10-year Risk Score was 20 percent, and the mean blood pressure was <span class=\"nowrap\">140/78</span> mmHg. Clinical or subclinical cardiovascular disease was present in 22 percent of patients.</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned to a standard treatment group (targeting the systolic pressure to &lt;140 mmHg) or an intensive treatment group (targeting the systolic pressure to &lt;120 mmHg); the diastolic pressure goal in both groups was &lt;90 mmHg. Blood pressure during the trial was measured using AOBPM. AOBPM is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H1244538168\" class=\"local\">'Importance of how blood pressure is measured'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Type of measurement devices'</a>.)</p><p>Antihypertensive therapy consisted of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB; but not both), a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (typically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>), or a thiazide-like diuretic (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a>) or a combination of these drugs to achieve the blood pressure target; other antihypertensive medications were added if needed. Medications were actively withdrawn in the standard treatment group if systolic blood pressure was below 130 to 135 mmHg, even in asymptomatic patients. In both groups, medications were altered or discontinued if patients developed adverse effects, and, at one year, only approximately one-half of the patients in the intensive-treatment arm attained a systolic pressure less than 120 mmHg; the mean systolic pressures in the two groups at one year were 121 and 136 mmHg, and the mean number of antihypertensive medications used were 2.8 and 1.8.</p><p>The trial was halted early for benefit after a median follow-up of 3.26 years; the key findings from SPRINT are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intensive as compared with standard treatment significantly reduced the rate of the primary endpoint, a composite of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, heart failure, or cardiovascular death (5.2 versus 6.8 percent). This difference was primarily due to a difference in the rate of heart failure (1.3 versus 2.1 percent). Among those with known cardiovascular disease at baseline, the risk of the primary endpoint was also lower (10.0 versus 11.8 percent), although this was not statistically significant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intensive treatment also significantly reduced mortality (3.3 versus 4.5 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute kidney injury (4.1 versus 2.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/goal-blood-pressure-in-adults-with-hypertension/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], syncope (2.3 versus 1.7 percent), and hyponatremia (3.8 versus 2.1 percent) were more common with intensive therapy, but the rates of orthostatic hypotension and falls resulting in hospitalization were similar between the groups. In addition, there were no differences between treatment groups with respect to physical and mental health-related quality of life, symptoms of depression, or satisfaction with care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/goal-blood-pressure-in-adults-with-hypertension/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>The findings from SPRINT suggest that, among older, hypertensive, nondiabetic adults at high risk for cardiovascular disease, targeting AOBPM to &lt;120 mmHg can reduce mortality and prevent cardiovascular events. However, a variety of factors are likely to affect the applicability of the findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients enrolled in SPRINT had controlled hypertension at baseline; also, patients enrolled in clinical trials, in general, are usually healthier than other patients with the same disorder. Thus, the rate of adverse events reported in SPRINT may be an underestimate of the adverse event rate that would be seen with intensive treatment in routine practice. In addition, patients in routine practice may require more antihypertensive medications than participants in SPRINT (the average was three in the intensive treatment group, and approximately one-fourth required four or more medications), and this could increase risk of adverse events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood pressure in SPRINT was measured using AOBPM, which corresponds more closely with mean daytime blood pressure (using 24-hour ambulatory monitoring) than with the routine (usually manual, auscultatory) blood pressure measurements that are routinely performed (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Technique of measurement'</a>). Auscultatory systolic pressure measurements are usually higher than AOBPM measurements (by 5 to 10 mmHg). Thus, if clinicians use routine blood pressure measurement (the most common method in clinical practice) rather than AOBPM, then targeting a systolic pressure of &lt;120 mmHg is likely to increase the risk of serious adverse events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients enrolled in SPRINT had diastolic pressures greater than 70 mmHg at baseline, and these pressures remained above 65 mmHg during the course of the trial, even in the intensive treatment group.

A limitation to this meta-analysis is that it did not distinguish between angiotensin inhibition and lower attained blood pressure as the mechanism of benefit. This limitation was overcome in a 2011 meta-analysis that included 25 placebo-controlled trials with more than 63,000 patients in which active treatment consisted of all major classes of antihypertensive drugs, including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, or combination therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/goal-blood-pressure-in-adults-with-hypertension/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Rather, the benefit seen likely resulted from blood pressure lowering. The absolute risk reductions in all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction were 14 and 13 per 1000 persons treated.</p><p>However, recommendations based upon SPRINT and these meta-analyses should <strong>not</strong> necessarily be applied to patients who are at low risk of having a cardiovascular event.

However, the rate of major cardiovascular events was nonsignificantly lower in the intensive treatment group (1 versus 5 events). A variety of other trials in patients with prior stroke examined attained (rather than target) blood pressure; most, but not all, found that lower achieved blood pressure was associated with fewer recurrent strokes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/goal-blood-pressure-in-adults-with-hypertension/abstract/41-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H54671266\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), we suggest a goal blood pressure of 125 to <span class=\"nowrap\">130/&lt;80</span> mmHg (using standard, routine clinician office measurements) or 120 to <span class=\"nowrap\">125/&lt;80</span> mmHg (using other methodology including AOBPM, home blood pressure, and ABPM). However, such patients are often prescribed multiple specific drugs to improve survival and reduce morbidity, independent of the blood pressure, including inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (eg, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or ARB-neprilysin inhibitors), beta blockers, diuretics, and, in selected patients, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Thus, achieved blood pressure in these patients is frequently much lower than these thresholds. Many experts consider the goal of therapy to be the lowest blood pressure that is not associated with symptoms of hypotension or evidence of hypoperfusion (eg, worsening azotemia).
