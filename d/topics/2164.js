Normally, the kidneys filter the blood and remove waste and excess salt and water (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79864\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79864 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1817871930\"><span class=\"h1\">What bone problems can be caused by kidney disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kidney disease can cause different types of bone problems. These problems usually start early on in kidney disease. If they are not treated, they will get worse as the kidney disease worsens.</p><p>Terms that doctors might use for the bone problems caused by kidney disease are &quot;renal osteodystrophy&quot; or &quot;chronic kidney disease bone mineral disorder.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1817871945\"><span class=\"h1\">How does kidney disease cause bone problems?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the kidneys don't work normally, the levels of certain substances in the body can get too high or too low.</p><p>Kidney disease commonly causes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High levels of phosphate (also called phosphorus) &ndash; Phosphate is a mineral found in many foods. Foods with high levels of phosphate include milk, other dairy foods, nuts, meat, eggs, beans, liver, and chocolate.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low levels of vitamin D</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low levels of calcium</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High levels of parathyroid hormone &ndash; Parathyroid hormone (also called &quot;PTH&quot;) is a hormone made by a gland in the neck called the parathyroid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66834\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66834 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p>Phosphate, vitamin D, calcium, and parathyroid hormone all have effects on each other. Bone problems happen when the levels of these substances get abnormal and out of balance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1817871983\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of bone problems caused by kidney disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early on, people usually have no symptoms from their bone disease. But they do have an increased chance of breaking a bone. Later on, people who get a treatment for kidney disease called dialysis might have symptoms from their bone disease such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone, joint, or muscle pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1817871998\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor will order blood tests to measure the levels of phosphate, calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone in your blood. People usually need to have these blood tests repeated on a regular basis.</p><p>Other tests that people might have include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An X-ray</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bone density test &ndash; Bone density testing is a way to measure how strong your bones are. It involves a special kind of X-ray.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bone biopsy &ndash; For this test, a doctor takes a small sample of your bone (usually from your hip). Then another doctor looks at it under a microscope. This is the only test that can tell for sure if you have bone problems caused by kidney disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1817872013\"><span class=\"h1\">How are bone problems caused by kidney disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your treatment will depend on different factors, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How severe your kidney disease is</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether you get dialysis treatment for your kidney disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your levels of phosphate, calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone</p><p/><p>In general, treatment for bone disease involves different parts.</p><p>The first part of treatment usually involves lowering your phosphate level. This can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diet changes &ndash; You should avoid eating foods that are high in phosphorus. But your doctor might recommend that you keep eating meat and eggs. Even though these foods are high in phosphorus, they are a good source of protein. To help you plan your meals, you will probably work with a dietitian (food expert).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Medicines called &quot;phosphate binders&quot; can help lower phosphate levels in the blood. There are different types of phosphate binders. Some contain calcium. Examples of these include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">calcium carbonate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-acetate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">calcium acetate</a>. Others do not contain calcium. Examples of these include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevelamer-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">sevelamer</a> (brand names: Renagel, Renvela) and lanthanum. Phosphate binders should be taken with food.</p><p/><p>Other treatments for bone problems caused by kidney disease can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitamin D medicines, to treat or prevent low levels of vitamin D</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;calcimimetic&quot; medicine &ndash; This is a type of medicine that works like calcium in the body.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extra calcium, to treat low levels of calcium</p><p/><p>These treatments will usually help lower the level of parathyroid hormone in your body. But if they don't, your doctor will talk with you about other treatment. This might involve surgery to remove your parathyroid glands.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1817872028\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-chronic-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for chronic kidney disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-and-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dialysis and diet (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
