While typical of asthma, these symptoms are nonspecific, making it difficult to distinguish asthma from other respiratory diseases. The definitive diagnosis of asthma requires the history or presence of respiratory symptoms consistent with asthma, combined with the demonstration of variable expiratory airflow obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The use of pulmonary function testing in the diagnosis of asthma will be reviewed here.

The most common are the measurement of spirometry pre and post bronchodilator, peak expiratory flow (PEF), and the flow-volume relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. It is important to realize that these techniques are not necessarily equivalent because of the complex physiology of the lung, the variable ability of patients to perform the tests, the accuracy of the tests themselves, and the underlying disease process.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Spirometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>National and international guidelines recommend the use of spirometry to diagnose and monitor asthma, as demonstration of reversible airflow limitation is a key component in the diagnosis of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-spirometry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office spirometry&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The three most important indices derived from spirometry are the forced vital capacity (FVC), which is the total volume of air exhaled, the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), and the ratio of FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Typical results in asthma</strong> &ndash; During times when individuals with asthma are asymptomatic, spirometry is often normal. When asthma is symptomatic, airflow limitation is usually present on spirometry, as indicated by a FEV<sub>1</sub> less than lower limits of normal (LLN; the fifth percentile of the confidence interval provided electronically by modern computerized spirometers) and a FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> ratio below 0.7 or below the fifth percentile LLN. On the other hand, some patients with asthma have asymptomatic airflow limitation usually associated with long standing disease that has not been well controlled. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similarly, FVC is normal or near normal, but can be decreased in the presence of air trapping or submaximal inhalation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Accuracy</strong> &ndash; Measurements of FEV<sub>1</sub>, FVC, and FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> ratio are reproducible, with coefficients of variation usually at 5 percent or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/4,5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7</a>]. The FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC</span> ratio has also been shown in numerous studies to be sensitive to the presence of airflow limitation. FEV<sub>1</sub> usually decreases more than the FVC if the airways narrow, whereas the decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> tracks the decrease in FVC if the airways close [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In patients with asthma, persistent reduction in FEV<sub>1</sub> correlates with increased asthma symptoms and severity and is also predictive of poorer clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The mean forced expiratory flow at 25 to 75 percent of forced vital capacity (FEF<sub>25-75</sub>), also known as the maximum mid-expiratory flow (MMEF), is highly dependent on the level of expiratory effort and the validity of the FVC maneuver. Thus, changes in the FEF<sub>25-75</sub> observed over time or in response to bronchodilator are not used to diagnose asthma in adults. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Flow-volume relationships</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The flow-volume relationship or loop is obtained by plotting flow against volume during the FVC (forced expiratory) maneuver. An inspiratory loop is obtained when a maximal inhalation to total lung capacity is performed after the FVC maneuver. This measurement yields useful additional information beyond that obtained with measurement of FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC, specifically by providing rapidly recognizable patterns that permit the clinician to differentiate bronchial asthma from the airflow limitation due to other causes, such as paradoxical vocal fold motion or a fixed obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flow-volume-loops\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flow-volume loops&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paradoxical-vocal-fold-motion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paradoxical vocal fold motion&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lower airways</strong> &ndash; The flow-volume loops in the figure demonstrate some of the patterns that can be encountered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80042\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80042 \">figure 1</a>). The upper left panel shows intrathoracic airflow limitation, such as might be seen in asthma or COPD. The notable feature is the downward &quot;scooping&quot; of the expiratory curve. In milder airflow limitation or disease largely confined to the small airways, the &quot;scooping&quot; occurs at low lung volume, so the FEV<sub>1</sub> may be normal, but the shape of the curve suggests airflow limitation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Upper airways</strong> &ndash; When using the flow-volume loop to identify processes other than asthma that can cause similar symptoms, the reductions in maximal respiratory flow shown in the lower three panels often accompany clinical symptoms of dyspnea and wheeze. However, the cause of airflow limitation in these situations is central airway narrowing rather than asthma. Such patients will not respond to asthma therapy, since inflammation or bronchospasm are not the cause of the airflow limitation. </p><p/><p>Once it has been determined that the patient has expiratory airflow limitation, the next step is to assess whether the airflow limitation is reversible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchodilator responses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airflow limitation from asthma should usually demonstrate some degree of reversibility following acute treatment with a beta-agonist. The currently recommended criteria in adults for a significant response to a bronchodilator are that FEV<sub>1</sub> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> FVC should increase by 12 percent or more and by at least 200 mL, although there is not complete consensus on these criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Withholding bronchodilators prior to testing</strong> &ndash; In preparation for assessing bronchodilator reversibility, ongoing bronchodilator medications should be withheld long enough for the bronchodilator effect to wear off, generally based on the duration of action (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F110199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110199 \">table 1</a>). Short-acting inhaled bronchodilators (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levalbuterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levalbuterol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipratropium</a>) should not be used for at least four hours prior to testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The long-acting beta-agonist bronchodilators (LABAs), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salmeterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salmeterol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=formoterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">formoterol</a>, are omitted for 12 hours prior to testing, while vilanterol and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indacaterol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indacaterol</a> are omitted for 24 hours. The long-acting anticholinergic agents <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycopyrrolate-glycopyrronium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycopyrrolate</a> (glycopyrronium), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tiotropium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tiotropium</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=umeclidinium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">umeclidinium</a> are omitted for 24 hours. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aclidinium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aclidinium</a> would be omitted for 12 hours, based on twice daily dosing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dose of short-acting beta-agonist for testing</strong> &ndash; Most laboratories use two or four metered-dose inhaler inhalations of a short-acting beta-agonist, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a>, via a valved holding chamber. For each puff of albuterol, patients are instructed to exhale slowly, then close their lips around the mouthpiece. One actuation of the inhaler is made into the chamber; the patient inhales fully to total lung capacity; the breath is held for 5 to 10 seconds before exhalation. The dose is repeated one to three times. The post-bronchodilator spirometry is performed after an appropriate delay for the bronchodilator used (10 to 20 minutes) to allow the beta-agonist to work. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Interpretation</strong> &ndash; For patients with baseline airflow limitation, an increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> FVC &ge;12 percent over baseline and &ge;200 mL is generally considered a positive response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Lack of bronchodilator reversibility in patients with baseline airflow limitation may suggest airways inflammation that requires additional therapy (eg, glucocorticoids) or an alternate diagnosis (eg, COPD, bronchiolitis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with spirometry within normal limits at baseline, an increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> of more than 8 percent following inhaled bronchodilator may suggest underlying airflow limitation, since the patient may have once had higher than predicted lung function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another response that can be observed after bronchodilator administration is a change in lung volumes for a given flow, ie, an isovolume shift in the flow volume curve without a change in FEV<sub>1</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This effect results from opening of lung units previously &quot;trapped&quot; at high lung volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, despite these units being open, their resistances remain high, and they do not contribute to the FEV<sub>1</sub> except to the extent that FVC falls. The figure shows patterns of flow volume loop response following bronchodilator administration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75013\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75013 \">figure 2</a>). It is important to realize that not all of these responses result in changes in PEF, FVC, or even FEV<sub>1</sub>. In such cases, other measurements are needed, such as lung volumes. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Lung volumes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other measures of airflow limitation</strong> &ndash; It has been suggested that additional parameters of airflow obstruction be used to assess reversibility, such as specific airway conductance (SGaw) obtained with a plethysmograph. This approach increases the likelihood of observing airflow reversibility, although it is not universally accepted. As an example, one study of 100 patients with clinically suspected reversible airway obstruction reported that spirometry detected reversible obstruction in 82 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Using body plethysmography revealed that 15 of the remaining 18 patients also responded to bronchodilators with either a change in SGaw or lung volumes. If a patient fails to show an improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> treatment and a clinical response appears to occur, body plethysmography can be used to document this change.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H226577483\"><span class=\"h2\">Peak expiratory flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peak expiratory flow (PEF) is measured during a maximally forceful and rapid exhalation that immediately follows a maximal inhalation. An advantage is that small, portable devices can be used. PEF measurements are most often used to monitor patients with a known diagnosis of asthma or to assess the role of a particular occupational exposure or trigger, rather than as a tool for the primary diagnosis of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The technique of measuring PEF and the role of PEF monitoring in asthma management are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peak expiratory flow rate monitoring in asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Measurement of PEF has several shortcomings for the diagnosis of asthma, the most serious of which is its significant dependence on effort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/4,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14</a>]. In contrast to spirometry, it is difficult to apply quality control to PEF measurement, as PEF meters cannot be easily calibrated; and, the lack of graphic display makes it difficult to ensure optimal technique and maximal patient effort. Furthermore, the large variability of PEF between individuals (&plusmn;30 percent) and for a given individual (&plusmn;15 percent) makes PEF insensitive for detecting airflow limitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p>PEF is a useful method of monitoring changes or trends in the patient's lung function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/2,4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,6</a>]. PEF results that vary little over time (less than 20 percent of the maximal value) argue against the diagnosis of asthma, while values that repeatedly fall by more than 20 percent when symptoms are present and return to baseline as symptoms resolve are consistent with asthma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchoprovocation challenge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A patient with mild or no airflow limitation may not show reversal after bronchodilator administration. In such cases, a bronchial challenge with inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> or other modalities would be indicated to demonstrate reversible airflow obstruction. A discussion of methacholine inhalation challenge and other types of bronchoprovocation is provided separately.

The measurement and interpretation of FE<sub>NO</sub> are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exhaled-nitric-oxide-analysis-and-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exhaled nitric oxide analysis and applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H341135837\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING ASTHMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective asthma management requires regular assessment of symptoms and pulmonary function, as suggested by national and international guidelines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;, section on 'Monitoring patients with asthma'</a>.) </p><p>Peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurement can be a useful component of home self-assessment and can help the patient identify changes in lung function during exacerbations or trigger exposure. Ongoing twice daily PEF assessment is typically reserved for patients with severe asthma or those with impaired perception of airflow limitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peak expiratory flow rate monitoring in asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The optimal frequency of spirometry during follow-up office visits for asthma has not been determined. Guidelines suggest repeat spirometry three to six months after initiation of controller therapy and periodically thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. We base the frequency of follow-up spirometry on the degree of asthma symptom control and the results of previous testing. If symptoms are well-controlled and prior spirometry was normal, follow-up spirometry can be obtained infrequently (eg, every one to three years). If the patient has persistent symptoms (eg, dyspnea, poor exercise tolerance, frequent short-acting beta-agonist use) or had baseline airflow limitation in the past, more frequent testing may be warranted (eg, at three to twelve month intervals). Test results can be used to determine whether symptoms reflect poor asthma control or an alternate process and whether therapy has improved lung function, or not. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;, section on 'Monitoring pulmonary function'</a>.)</p><p>Some experts obtain a PEF measurement at the time of initial spirometry to assess whether the percent predicted PEF correlates with the percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>). If so, PEF can be used at the time of follow-up office visits for objective monitoring of asthma control in the context of the comprehensive assessment of symptoms and risk of exacerbation. However, studies have not been done to validate this approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3151703304\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECT OF ASTHMA ON OTHER PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the diagnosis of asthma is based on spirometric results, insights in to the pathophysiology of asthma can be gained from assessment of lung volumes and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/8,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung volumes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main role for lung volume determination in patients with asthma is to exclude other causes of or contributors to dyspnea.

As an example, in a patient who presents with episodic dyspnea after working in a barn or exposure to epoxy resin, a reduced forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) combined with a reduced total lung capacity (TLC) suggests a restrictive process, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, rather than asthma. This alternate diagnosis might be further evaluated with chest computed tomography, which would likely demonstrate centrilobular nodular opacities, consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3121557049\"><span class=\"h3\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relationships among lung capacities and volumes are demonstrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55440\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55440 \">figure 3</a>).

If not due to poor expiratory effort, a high RV is interpreted as abnormal closure of airways, which can be confirmed by observing a fall in RV following bronchodilator therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Functional residual capacity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A value for FRC greater than the upper 95<sup>th</sup> percentile (preferred) or &ge;120 percent predicted suggests air trapping. Thus, the FRC may be elevated in asthma, especially during the acute phase of an asthmatic attack (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64766\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64766 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Several mechanisms are probably involved, but persistent or tonic activity of the inspiratory muscles is largely responsible for the rise in FRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The increase in FRC is important, because hyperinflation is thought to be responsible for sensations of chest tightness and dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Total lung capacity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A value for TLC greater than the upper 95<sup>th</sup> percentile (preferred) or &ge;120 percent predicted suggests hyperinflation. In asthma, the TLC can either be normal or elevated, although an elevated TLC is more commonly seen in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64766\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64766 \">figure 4</a>). Elevation in the TLC is usually associated with more severe airflow limitation or asthma of longer duration. The likely physiological mechanisms for hyperinflation include a loss of lung elastic recoil, increased outward recoil of the chest wall, and increased inspiratory muscle strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Use of <span class=\"nowrap\">RV/TLC</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">FRC/TLC</span> ratios can be quite helpful in patients for whom predicted values of the individual measurements are less reliable, eg, young children or patients with unusual ethnic origins. The <span class=\"nowrap\">RV/TLC</span> is generally high, but must be greater than approximately 150 percent of predicted before it can be considered to be abnormal.</p><p>Patterns suggestive of restrictive (reduced TLC) or mixed processes should alert the clinician to consider other disease processes, such as chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, bronchiectasis, or concomitant pleural or neuromuscular disease and asthma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Diffusing capacity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The DLCO (also called the transfer factor for carbon monoxide) measures the ability of the lungs to transfer gas from inhaled air to the red blood cells in pulmonary capillaries. The technique for measuring DLCO and its interpretation are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diffusing-capacity-for-carbon-monoxide\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with asthma, the DLCO is usually either normal or high, and the degree of elevation is related to asthma severity. The mechanisms potentially explaining this elevation include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/5,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,22,23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in negative intrathoracic pressure during inspiration, which draws blood into the thorax.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improved ventilation-perfusion matching due to increased perfusion of the apices.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin extravasation due to the inflammatory process, although evidence that this occurs in asthma is limited.</p><p/><p>The main reasons to perform a DLCO measurement in an asthmatic patient are to distinguish between other causes of reversible airflow limitation and asthma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68527\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68527 \">table 2</a>) and to identify alternative diagnoses when dyspnea is not well explained by spirometric findings. As an example, patients who have COPD may present with a misdiagnosis of asthma; however, the DLCO should be decreased in emphysema, but not asthma. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL TESTING IN PATIENTS WITH COMORBID DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, patients have more than one process affecting respiratory function. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Asthma and COPD overlap</strong> &ndash; Approximately 15 to 20 percent of patients with asthma have concurrent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), known as asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. According to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) and Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) consensus statement, ACOS &quot;is characterized by persistent airflow limitation with several features usually associated with asthma and several features usually associated with COPD. ACOS is therefore identified in clinical practice by the features that it shares with both asthma and COPD&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Measurement of lung volumes, variability in airflow limitation, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) may be useful in identifying features of concomitant asthma and COPD, such as hyperinflation, persistent but variable airflow limitation, or a reduced DLCO. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging#H1074708457\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Definition, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Asthma-COPD overlap'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Asthma and tracheal stenosis</strong> &ndash; A patient could have asthma and develop tracheal stenosis or vocal fold paralysis following endotracheal intubation. Dyspnea would likely be out of proportion to the expiratory flow limitation. Flow volume loops described above might help to identify fixed or variable upper airway flow limitation, although sometimes direct visualization is necessary. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Flow-volume relationships'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management-of-central-airway-obstruction-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of central airway obstruction in adults&quot;</a>.). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Asthma and respiratory muscle weakness</strong> &ndash; A patient with asthma could develop diaphragmatic weakness or other respiratory muscle impairment as a comorbid disease or as a consequence of systemic glucocorticoid therapy. Respiratory muscle weakness is most often assessed by measurement of maximal <span class=\"nowrap\">inspiratory/expiratory</span> mouth pressures, although other less well established measurements can also be performed. (See <a href=\"#H932087046\" class=\"local\">'Research tools for assessment of airflow limitation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests of respiratory muscle strength&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to maximal <span class=\"nowrap\">inspiratory/expiratory</span> mouth pressures, examining lung volumes can help identify reduced muscular output (eg, due to respiratory muscle weakness), which is associated with the combination of high residual volume (RV) but low total lung capacity (TLC) without evidence of interstitial disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64766\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64766 \">figure 4</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H932087046\"><span class=\"h1\">RESEARCH TOOLS FOR ASSESSMENT OF AIRFLOW LIMITATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Research tools are in development for the assessment of airflow limitation in patients with difficulty performing spirometry, identification of patients at increased risk of near-fatal or fatal asthma due to reduced hypoxic responsiveness, and evaluation of static recoil to better understand the overlap of asthma and COPD.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tests not requiring patient effort</strong> &ndash; Assessment of lung functions such as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) requires that the patient perform forced vital capacity (FVC) maneuvers reproducibly and with maximal effort (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Spirometry'</a> above). However, a number of other techniques have been developed that yield similar information about airways function but do not require patient effort. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One such technique is the application of oscillatory <span class=\"nowrap\">pressure/flow</span> to the lungs or the forced oscillation technique (FOT) where impulse oscillometry is one variant. Pressure waves are applied at the mouth to measure resistance and reactance of the total respiratory system. A major advantage and attraction of FOT is that it does not require maximal efforts, but like specific airway conductance (SGaw) these endpoints are not always equivalent to the FEV<sub>1</sub>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-children-younger-than-12-years-initial-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Asthma in children younger than 12 years: Initial evaluation and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Children &lt;5 years'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The forced oscillation technique is very useful in patients who cannot or will not perform the standard tests, such as the very young or old. These tests might also enable identification of obstructive airways disease in patients with respiratory muscle weakness. However, these measures have not been applied to large populations to generate predicted values and in some cases the endpoints show high variability. As a result, the response of these indices to bronchodilators or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/exercise</span> takes on more importance than does an isolated baseline result.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Control of breathing</strong> &ndash; Measurement of the ventilatory response to low oxygen (hypoxia) or high CO<sub>2</sub> (hypercapnia) assesses the ability of the body to respond to respiratory stimuli. It has been shown that some patients with severe asthma have reduced hypoxic responsiveness in addition to a poor perception of dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A potential application of this testing is to identify and characterize those patients at risk for near-fatal asthma exacerbations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lung static recoil</strong> &ndash; Lung static recoil refers to the elastic forces in the lung causing passive exhalation. As the lung expands during inhalation, the elastic recoil forces increase. At full inspiration after flow ceases, the lung static recoil is maximal. Elastic recoil is inversely proportional to compliance <span class=\"nowrap\">(volume/pressure),</span> which is the slope of the pressure-volume curve. While it is generally believed that asthma causes a parallel upward shift of the pressure-volume (PV) curve of the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], several studies have demonstrated a loss of elastic recoil, ie, decreased static recoil pressure at a given volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Measurement of the static recoil of the lung is accomplished through determination of the PV relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Static recoil is important because maximal expiratory flow, as measured with the FEV<sub>1</sub> or flow-volume relationship, is determined both by airways caliber and the static recoil of the lung, which is the driving pressure for expiratory flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], whereas a static recoil is a measure of the elastic forces of the lung.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A situation in which determination of the PV relationship might be helpful is in a patient with a low FEV<sub>1</sub> of unclear etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-function-testing-in-asthma/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Theoretically, examination of pressure volume curves could help determine the cause by showing movement of the pressure-volume curve upwards and to the left in a patient with increased compliance and reduced elastic recoil due to emphysema. Conversely, movement downwards and to the right might indicate interstitial lung disease. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An approach to the use of PFTs in the diagnosis of asthma is provided in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F110958\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef110958 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Normal baseline airflow that increases by similar amounts is consistent with mild, reversible airflow limitation.
