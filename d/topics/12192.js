However, almost the entire increase has been in peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organization-and-elements-of-a-home-hemodialysis-program/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Among conventional dialysis modalities, home hemodialysis three times a week during the day or overnight most readily achieves these goals. In general, patients treated with home hemodialysis lead more independent lives, have better rehabilitation, and have higher survival outcomes than those treated with other dialysis modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organization-and-elements-of-a-home-hemodialysis-program/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. This is due in part to home hemodialysis patients generally getting more adequate dialysis than those treated in center (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home hemodialysis&quot;</a>). Additional benefits include the assumption of more individual responsibility for performing the treatment and a diminished role for dialysis in the patient's life (rather than being dominated by a dialysis schedule).</p><p>Most importantly, home hemodialysis provides the best opportunity to perform more frequent dialysis, either during the day or overnight. This results in further striking improvement in patient wellbeing, reduces symptoms during and between dialyses, and improves quality of life and opportunity for rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organization-and-elements-of-a-home-hemodialysis-program/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Technical aspects of nocturnal hemodialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-daily-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short daily hemodialysis&quot;</a>.) Unfortunately, Medicare and some fiscal intermediaries will only pay for three dialyses weekly, even with medical justification. Every report in the literature has confirmed the benefits of dialysis performed five, six, or seven times a week.</p><p>Conventional home hemodialysis using available equipment three times a week usually requires the presence of a partner (family member or assistant, paid or unpaid) to help the patient. Unlike continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis <span class=\"nowrap\">(CAPD)/continuous</span> cycler peritoneal dialysis (CCPD), which can be performed without assistance, a home hemodialysis partner shares some of the stress of technical and medical problems and has to be trained to treat potential emergencies. Patient-friendly equipment designed specifically for home use that allows for more frequent hemodialysis and, in some cases, does not require use of a water treatment system means that there is less need for a partner to take as much of an active role, so some patients can complete the whole procedure themselves.</p><p>The elements required to organize a successful home hemodialysis program are discussed in this topic review and elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organization-and-elements-of-a-home-hemodialysis-program/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ELEMENTS OF A HOME HEMODIALYSIS PROGRAM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the advent of almost universal Medicare coverage for the treatment of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the financial concerns of patients and dialysis programs were a major driving force behind the development and popularity of home hemodialysis. To allow charitable funds, endowments, and other limited funding resources to be used to treat the greatest number of patients, the policy in Seattle and some other programs required as many patients as possible to use home hemodialysis since this was less expensive than outpatient dialysis.</p><p>As a result, some 40 percent of the 10,000 dialysis patients in the United States were on home hemodialysis when the Medicare ESRD program began in 1973. However, the proportion of patients with renal failure choosing home hemodialysis in the United States has subsequently steadily declined and has diminished even more rapidly since 1983 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organization-and-elements-of-a-home-hemodialysis-program/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. By 2002, only 1758 patients (0.57 percent of all dialysis patients) were on home hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organization-and-elements-of-a-home-hemodialysis-program/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The factors responsible for this decrease are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, over the last few years, the use of home hemodialysis in the United States has begun to increase due to growing interest in more frequent hemodialysis and the development of more patient-friendly equipment. By 2007, the patient numbers had increased to 2999 (0.81 percent of all dialysis patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organization-and-elements-of-a-home-hemodialysis-program/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>] and, at the end of 2010, to more than 4000 home hemodialysis patients in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organization-and-elements-of-a-home-hemodialysis-program/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. According to the 2015 United States Renal Data System (USRDS) Annual Data Report, home hemodialysis was 222 percent higher in 2013 compared with 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organization-and-elements-of-a-home-hemodialysis-program/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>A successful home hemodialysis program starts with support from the patient's nephrologist. He or she must educate the patient about the benefits of home hemodialysis and encourage him or her to select this treatment option. This process begins with chronic kidney disease (CKD) modality education, which may provide the patient&rsquo;s first exposure to the possibility of home hemodialysis. The 2008 Medicare conditions for coverage require that patients be educated about home modalities and that exclusion criteria to home modalities be identified yearly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organization-and-elements-of-a-home-hemodialysis-program/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>There must also be a strong infrastructure in place to assure patient support in the home and to foster patient independence and self-motivation. Unfortunately, most nephrologists in the United States today have had little or no exposure to home hemodialysis during or after their training because of the lack of home hemodialysis programs.</p><p>Successful training leads to a confident, competent, and independent patient and helper. This goal requires a multidisciplinary approach coordinated by a home-training nurse who works with the nephrologist, social worker, dietitian, and equipment technician. Follow-up home support, available 24 hours per day, provides the framework that sustains day-to-day operations in the patient's home and allows for monthly multidisciplinary reviews and interventions when problems arise.</p><p>With increasing use of overnight home hemodialysis, remote, online monitoring of patients is used in some programs to ensure safety, accurate data collection, and reassurance of patients, staff, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organization-and-elements-of-a-home-hemodialysis-program/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Nevertheless, other nephrologists with home hemodialysis experience remain unconvinced of the benefits of this expensive process in terms of patient safety. A review from the program in London, Ontario suggests that nocturnal home hemodialysis patients should be monitored for the first three months at home until the patient is stable and compliant but is only necessary thereafter if indicated by medical problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organization-and-elements-of-a-home-hemodialysis-program/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Technical aspects of nocturnal hemodialysis&quot;</a>.) In the future, it seems likely that use of the internet for communication and transmission of information will become important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organization-and-elements-of-a-home-hemodialysis-program/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>A successful home hemodialysis program must become financially sound and self-supporting. However, because Medicare payment for training dialysis is inadequate, it takes 15 to 25 home hemodialysis patients for the home program to be financially sound and self-reporting. This requires a program that supports at least some 20 patients. This is also important in order for the nurses providing the training to maintain their skills.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Objectives of the home hemodialysis training program</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary objective of training is to assist patients and their helpers (if necessary) to perform dialysis safely, with good quality outcomes and without undue anxiety. Additional important objectives are to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify suitable candidates for home hemodialysis before they have to start dialysis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Train the patient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> helper (if needed) to perform safe hemodialysis in the home</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Instill confidence in the patient that support is always available to provide medical or technical assistance when problems or emergencies arise</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide emotional support as patients, families, and helpers adjust to the stresses of home hemodialysis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assure staff that patient and helpers possess expertise in all necessary aspects of the dialysis procedure (venipuncture, water treatment, initiation and termination of the dialysis procedure, vital signs, heparin administration, saline administration, emergency procedures, etc)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide respite care for the helper with time-limited in-center therapy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide monitoring and follow-up care once the patient is home, so as to assure successful adaptation to the home environment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide continuing education and updating of procedures</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detail the specific roles of each healthcare team member, including nephrologists, training nurses, technicians, dietitians, and social workers</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensure that the home hemodialysis patients have outcomes at least as good or better than the outcomes of patients dialyzing as outpatients in dialysis units</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Identification of home hemodialysis candidates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the start of the ESRD program, Medicare regulations have required that all modalities of treatment, including home hemodialysis, be explained and offered to new patients. This rarely happens. One survey in 2002 showed that 48 percent of patients were not presented with treatment options until less than one month before the initiation of dialysis or after dialysis was started; only 12 percent of patients were presented with the option of home hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organization-and-elements-of-a-home-hemodialysis-program/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In the past, there were few home hemodialysis training programs, and, as a result, home hemodialysis was not entertained as a possible modality at most of the more than 4000 dialysis facilities in the United States.</p><p>For those facilities that do offer home dialysis, the burden of finding candidates and a training program they can be referred to rests primarily on the nephrologist or on the nurses and social workers in the facility. Improved <span class=\"nowrap\">pre-ESRD/CKD</span> education that discusses all treatment modalities hopefully will lead to access to home hemodialysis for all medically suitable patients.</p><p>A potentially important stimulus to home hemodialysis is in the ESRD Conditions of Coverage that became effective on October 14, 2008 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organization-and-elements-of-a-home-hemodialysis-program/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These &quot;require evaluation of the patient's abilities, interests, preferences, and goals, including the level of participation in the dialysis care process; the preferred modality (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis), and setting (for example, home dialysis), and the patient's expectations for care outcomes.&quot; One proposed regulation is that &quot;Patient records must demonstrate that each patient was informed about all dialysis modalities and locations for home dialysis training if that service is not available at this facility. If the patient expressed interest in home dialysis and was determined to be a suitable candidate, the plan of care should list this modality as a goal and identify ways to achieve it (eg, timeline for training in home dialysis at current facility, referral to a facility certified for home training and support).&quot;</p><p>Some patients will request home hemodialysis spontaneously; more frequently, however, clinicians, social workers, or nurses in an outpatient dialysis center refer the patient to a home hemodialysis training program. If done early, this referral gives the patient opportunity to meet and be evaluated by training staff and to meet successful home hemodialysis patients. The patient's and potential partner's ability to learn necessary skills and concepts are also assessed by the staff. In addition, these meetings help the patient understand the advantages of home hemodialysis, including the value of independence, a more flexible dialysis schedule, and freedom from the nuisances of travel and other inconveniences associated with outpatient hemodialysis.</p><p>Factors involved in patient selection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Living circumstances and accommodations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Learning ability and motivation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Level of patient and family anxiety</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type and severity of medical conditions</p><p/><p>Motivation and compliance are most important, but the degree of anxiety of both patient and family must not be neglected. The social worker plays an important role in assessing the patient's social, emotional, and financial support for home treatment.</p><p>The major contraindication to home hemodialysis is frequent instability during dialysis due to severe cardiovascular disease. Age and diabetes themselves are not contraindications. A useful tool to help assess a patient's suitability for home hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis has been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organization-and-elements-of-a-home-hemodialysis-program/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>To alleviate patients' natural anxieties, it is useful to point out that if they can drive an automobile, they can certainly learn to &quot;drive&quot; a kidney machine. In neither case do they need a detailed understanding of what is inside the machine; rather, they must learn how to operate it safely and understand how to deal with the problems that may occur. In both cases, technical and other support are available as needed.</p><p>In addition, one should note that the purpose of home programs is to provide better dialysis to the patient in a more convenient setting. The frequent modalities (daily nocturnal or short daily) are based on the strategy that is ideal for volume control (less is gained so less need be removed) and improved hemodynamic stability.

The American Association for Medical Instrumentation has published detailed standards for water quality, water supply, drain and power, the environment, equipment, concentrate, and monitoring for home hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organization-and-elements-of-a-home-hemodialysis-program/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Development of a comprehensive assessment and plan of care that can be used to set goals and targets for the patient to achieve while at home.

Others begin training soon after a patient has been stabilized on dialysis. An early start in or transfer to the home training unit encourages independence and confidence from the beginning. The training staff should be selected for their teaching skills, as well as their knowledge of dialysis.</p><p>The education schedule can proceed in a variety of ways to accommodate the patient's work and social schedule. Once the patient is medically stable and has a suitable blood access, he or she should be taught to insert his or her own needles. This is often the most difficult hurdle for the patient to overcome. Many programs teach patients the buttonhole technique for cannulation of the access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/organization-and-elements-of-a-home-hemodialysis-program/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Most programs train and educate one-on-one during actual dialysis treatments. At the same time, teaching can also begin about such subjects as aseptic technique, the meaning of vital signs, the importance of vascular access care, diet, medications, and renal disease and its complications.</p><p>After gaining competence in blood access, subsequent training addresses:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Setting up the equipment including water treatment equipment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initiation and termination of dialysis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preventive maintenance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Handling of emergencies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administering medications</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Documentation</p><p/><p>The patient also develops expertise in routine dialysis procedures: monitoring of vital signs during dialysis, prescribing ultrafiltration, completion of flow sheets, full documentation of any event, and heparin and saline administration. The patient and helper are taught how to record and complete dialysis log sheets and how to take and mail blood samples for laboratory tests. Training must also cover equipment maintenance, ordering and storage of supplies, and how to access the support services. The patient or family member can administer erythropoietin-stimulating agents at home and other medications, if the patient's insurance will pay for this. Parenteral iron is probably best administered at the dialysis facility, which also gives a good opportunity to assess the adequacy of dialysis.</p><p>The overall goal of the training program is to give individualized instruction to the patient and helper so they can dialyze safely at home. As far as possible, the patient should be in charge of and responsible for the treatments while the partner serves as the assistant, although this may vary depending upon the abilities of the patient.</p><p>Generally, home hemodialysis training takes between three weeks and two to three months, depending upon the program and the skills and learning abilities of the patient and partner. During training, progress must be assessed and recorded at regular intervals to ensure acquisition of the necessary skills and knowledge. A mechanism for objective scoring of the patient's skills is important in order to ensure patient consistency in carrying out procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Predischarge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to move out of the training center and into the home is a mutual one between the patient and training nurse. To ensure the competence of the patient and helper, the last few dialyses can be done alone, behind closed doors, with staff available by phone, as would be the case at home. Alternatively, a training nurse can attend the first few sessions at home.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Ongoing support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient and partner must know how to react in emergency situations. They must also be aware that a staff member is available by telephone 24 hours a day to answer questions, assist with complications, or refer to a clinician or technician, if necessary. Home visits by training staff are essential; the first should be shortly after the patient goes home, and subsequent visits should be at 6- or 12-month intervals, or as required. These visits allow the training nurse to observe dialysis technique and safety, provide information and education, observe family dynamics, and answer questions. This also is an opportunity to remind the patient to make appointments to see his or her nephrologist in the office or to be seen in the home dialysis clinic by the training staff.</p><p>Routine blood samples must be sent to the laboratory monthly, and the clinician and training staff review the results and the dialysis log sheets. Nephrologists follow home hemodialysis patients in their office, usually once a month or more frequently, as medically required.</p><p>In the United States, Congress passed a prospective payment system (PPS) for the ESRD program that became effective on January 1, 2010.
