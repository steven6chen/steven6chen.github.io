It has also been used for other conditions, which are discussed briefly below.</p><p>This topic will focus on a description of spinal manipulation and a discussion of its effectiveness.

This movement of the joint is frequently accompanied by an audible cracking or popping sound.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of manipulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal manipulation is classified into one of two forms, depending upon the lever arm used to help the practitioner apply the load necessary for the manipulation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first type includes long-lever, low- to high-velocity, or nonspecific manipulations; this form uses one of the long bones of the limbs (frequently the femur) to amplify the load applied by the clinician's hands to one or several spinal joints.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second type includes short-lever, high-velocity manipulations, or specific spinal adjustments; this form involves a short, forceful thrust on a specific vertebral transverse process, thereby moving the specific joint.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Postulated mechanisms of benefit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the benefits of manipulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relaxation of hypertonic muscle by sudden stretching</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disruption of articular or periarticular adhesions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unblocking of motion segments that have undergone disproportionate displacements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alteration of pain-related reflexes by proprioceptive bombardment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in central pain pathways</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reflexive muscle activation due to increased afferent output</p><p/><p>Although some research supports each of these hypotheses, there is no convincing evidence proving the pathophysiologic mechanism underlying the benefit of spinal manipulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">LOW BACK PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal manipulation is used for the treatment of both acute and chronic low back pain. This is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-and-chronic-low-back-pain-nonpharmacologic-and-pharmacologic-treatment#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute and chronic low back pain: Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment&quot;, section on 'Spinal manipulation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain#H328640201\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute low back pain&quot;, section on 'Spinal manipulation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">NECK PAIN AND HEADACHE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After low back pain, neck pain and headache are the next most common symptoms for which spinal manipulative therapy is offered. Together, these symptoms account for about 20 percent of all visits to chiropractors. It is estimated that between 18 and 38 million cervical spine manipulations are performed annually in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of manipulation for neck pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We believe the evidence at this time is inconclusive to draw a strong conclusion; however, cervical or thoracic spine manipulation may benefit some patients with nonspecific neck pain. The data supporting the efficacy of spinal manipulation for neck pain is limited by small, generally low quality studies. A systematic review evaluating 51 trials of cervical and thoracic manipulation and mobilization for neck pain included three studies that compared cervical manipulation with a control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Among studies comparing multiple sessions of cervical manipulation with education, manipulation provided better pain relief and functional improvement; however, more research is needed to guide optimal treatment choices. The same review also examined thoracic manipulation and found some evidence to support the use of thoracic manipulation for neck pain compared to inactive controls. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of manipulation for headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since 1988, approximately 20 clinical trials have evaluated the effectiveness of cervical spinal manipulation for the prevention of various types of headache, including migraine, tension-type, or cervicogenic headache. A systematic review concluded that spinal manipulation may be as effective as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a> in the prophylactic treatment of migraine headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The same review found evidence that spinal manipulation was more effective than no treatment in the prophylaxis of cervicogenic headache. The evidence was not strong enough to evaluate the effectiveness cervical spinal manipulation for tension-type headaches. Studies evaluated were heterogeneous and generally of low quality, so that conclusions were judged to be tentative and subject to change based on findings from higher quality studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Synthesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advice regarding spinal manipulation in the treatment of neck pain and headache is based on weak findings available from the current literature:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients treated with short courses of mobilization appear to do as well as those treated with high-velocity manipulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal manipulation, either of the neck or thoracic spine, included along with education and home exercises, was more effective than medication.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal manipulation alone may be of benefit in certain kinds of headaches.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are rare but serious adverse effects associated with neck manipulation. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Serious adverse events'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Patients whose neck pain symptoms are not resolving within seven days and who are interested in manipulative therapy may be offered therapy to include cervical spine manipulation along with education about neck pain and home exercises.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER CLINICAL CONDITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A randomized trial in 150 patients with shoulder pain and dysfunction found that, compared with usual care, patients treated with manipulation of the cervical spine, upper thoracic spine, and adjacent ribs had higher rates of improvement after 12 weeks of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The study examined the primary outcome (patient-perceived recovery) at a number of points in time without adjusting for multiple testing.</p><p>Chiropractic spinal manipulation does not appear to provide additional clinical benefit for the medical treatment of asthma in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. At present, there are no compelling data supporting the efficacy of spinal manipulation for non-musculoskeletal disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">RISKS OF SPINAL MANIPULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, spinal manipulation is felt to be a relatively safe procedure, although it may be associated with a number of minor complaints and, rarely, serious adverse events.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Minor complaints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minor complaints following spinal manipulation are common, with rates variably reported between 33 and 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. One systematic review of five prospective studies concluded that mild to moderate transient adverse reactions, including <span class=\"nowrap\">dizziness/light</span> headedness, headache, and numbness, occurred in one-half of all patients undergoing spinal manipulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In the largest series of 19,722 patients, there were no serious adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Minor events such as <span class=\"nowrap\">dizziness/light</span> headedness occurred in up to 16 per 1000 visits immediately following treatment and 13 per 1000 after seven days. A randomized trial of manipulation for neck pain found that low-velocity mobilization was somewhat less likely than high-velocity manipulation to lead to adverse reactions; however, adverse reactions were common in both groups, occurring in 30 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Increased neck pain or stiffness was the most common adverse event, occurring in 25 percent of patients. Compared with younger patients, those &gt;65 years may have a higher rate of adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>However, a randomized trial of chiropractic care (involving manipulation and mobilization treatment for 95.5 and 52.6 percent of treated patients) in 183 adult spinal pain patients, in which a control group received sham treatment, found no difference in rates of reported adverse events between treatment and control groups (relative risk [RR] 1.24, 95% CI 0.85-1.81) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The most common reported events were increased pain and muscle stiffness, affecting approximately 30 percent of patients in both treatment and sham treatment groups. No serious adverse events occurred in either group. Thus, minor adverse events reported in observational series are potentially unrelated to the treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Serious adverse events</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common serious adverse events reported to be associated with spinal manipulation include disk herniation, the cauda equina syndrome, and vertebrobasilar accidents. Estimates of the incidence of these complications vary, ranging from 1 per 2 million to 1 per 400,000 manipulations in one review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and up to 1 per 20,000 in another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These estimates are primarily derived from published case reports, case series, and retrospective surveys, all of which may be unreliable due to underreporting and the dependence on recall. No serious adverse event has been reported from any of the published clinical trials of cervical spinal manipulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Disk herniation and the cauda equina syndrome have been associated with lumbar manipulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Individuals with a herniated nucleus pulposus or an underlying bleeding disorder are postulated to be at increased risk of the cauda equina syndrome.</p><p>Studies of vertebrobasilar dissection or occlusion possibly associated with cervical spine manipulation include case reports, prospective series, and case control studies. While an association has been reported, the causality between manipulation and dissection has not been established. Some reports estimate stroke or vertebrobasilar dissection to occur as infrequently as once per one to three million manipulations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], while others report an incidence as high as 5 per 100,000 manipulations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A six-week prospective study of cervical spine manipulation involved 377 chiropractors in Britain (32 percent of the country's chiropractors, although all were invited to participate) and over 19,000 patients and 50,000 cervical manipulations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. No serious adverse events were reported by clinicians or patients in this timeframe. However, underreporting was possible both due to loss to follow-up for 413 consultations, and potential bias related to self-reporting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A population-based, case-control study found that in patients under the age of 45, those with vertebrobasilar dissection or occlusion were five times more likely than controls to have visited a chiropractor in the previous week and to have had three or more cervical chiropractic visits in the previous month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. No association between chiropractic and vertebrobasilar events was found for older individuals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A case-control study of patients younger than 60 presenting with a stroke or transient ischemic attack found a higher rate of spinal manipulation within the previous 30 days in patients whose event was due to a vertebral arterial dissection than in patients with an event due to another etiology (odds ratio [OR] 6.62, 95% CI 1.4-30) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, another case control study of vertebrobasilar stroke in persons under the age of 45 found that patients were three times more likely than controls to have visited either a chiropractor or a primary care physician prior to their stroke; the authors postulate that visits to either of these healthcare providers are a marker for impending VBA and are likely not causally related to subsequent VBA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p>A paucity of data exists concerning the risk factors for vertebrobasilar compromise after manipulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the risk is higher for manipulation involving rotation plus extension of the cervical spine than for other types of manipulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many case reports describing complications due to misdiagnosis by providers who perform spinal manipulation, such as failing to correctly diagnose spinal tumors or metastatic disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H792945096\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
