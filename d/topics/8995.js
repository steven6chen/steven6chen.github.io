All of these drugs have beneficial hemodynamic effects in patients with HFrEF (also known as systolic HF) due in part to direct inotropic actions that cause an increase in cardiac output. In addition, several of these agents increase cardiac output due to direct arterial vasodilator effects (eg, milrinone, levosimendan, pimobendan) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the withdrawal of neurohormonal vasoconstrictor mechanisms such as angiotensin II and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norepinephrine</a> (eg, dobutamine, digoxin).</p><p>Therapy with these agents is of potential value only in patients with decreased cardiac contractility. Those with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF; also known as diastolic HF) do not need inotropic support, and the myocardial effects of these agents may be detrimental in such patients.</p><p>The efficacy of acute intravenous inotropic support is well established in patients with severe myocardial systolic dysfunction. However, the efficacy of chronic administration of oral inotropic agents other than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> in ambulatory patients with HF remains unproven. On the contrary, available data suggest that the chronic use of many of these drugs may increase mortality.

For refractory HF, potential treatment options include coronary revascularization (for ischemic cardiomyopathy), mechanical circulatory support (eg, left ventricular assist device), and cardiac transplantation. With appropriate protection against the risks of sudden death and catheter infection, selected patients may receive inotropic therapy on an outpatient basis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-cardiomyopathy-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ischemic cardiomyopathy: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-refractory-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of refractory heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;, section on 'Intravenous inotropes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intermediate- and long-term mechanical circulatory support&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-contraindications-for-cardiac-transplantation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and contraindications for cardiac transplantation in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The clinical improvements seen with inotropes (reduced hospitalization, less frequent worsening of HF) are beneficial because the patient is maintained in an optimal clinical condition prior to surgery. Such patients can be discharged from the hospital if clinically stable and managed on an outpatient basis with the assistance of a visiting nurse and a home infusion therapy program. The increased risk of sudden death associated with these agents can be mitigated with the use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and, if appropriate, pharmacotherapy (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>) for the suppression of ventricular arrhythmias.

In this setting, the goal of HF management is to maintain the patient's clinical stability long enough to enable the patient to undergo transplantation when a donor heart becomes available. A variety of approaches have been used to &quot;bridge&quot; a patient to heart transplantation, including the use of mechanical ventricular assist devices.

All but one of the patients received an ICD prior to hospital discharge. Intravenous inotropic therapy resulted in significant improvements in functional capacity, renal function, and hemodynamics as well as a decrease in the number of hospitalizations. Fifteen patients underwent heart transplantation, three died, and three were still awaiting transplantation at the end of follow-up. There were five episodes of catheter infection or thrombosis during home infusion therapy, one resulting in fatal septic shock.

In countries where levosimendan is approved for clinical use, levosimendan or a PDE-3 inhibitor may be used to reverse the effects of beta blockade if beta blockade is thought to be contributing to hypotension causing hypoperfusion as suggested in the 2017 ESC HF guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inotropic-agents-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Dobutamine is primarily a beta-1 agonist. The dobutamine (-) isomer is an alpha-1 agonist and the (+) isomer is a beta-1 agonist and alpha-1 antagonist; the racemic mixture has mixed alpha-1 effect and minimal beta-2 effects and thus has minimal effect on peripheral vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inotropic-agents-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>As a result of studies suggesting potential risk of increased mortality with longer-term use, the administration of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> has been largely limited to the inpatient management of patients with severe decompensated HF. In this setting, dobutamine appears to be as effective as the intravenous PDE-3 inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milrinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milrinone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inotropic-agents-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Intravenous PDE inhibitors are an alternative to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a>. However, important differences exist. The PDE-3 inhibitors, unlike dobutamine, are potent vasodilators, and as such, the left heart filling pressure and systemic vascular resistance of the patient need to be considered in selecting the most appropriate inotropic agent. In addition, the response to beta adrenergic agonists is more likely to be attenuated due to desensitization of the beta adrenergic receptor pathway, a common occurrence in severe HF. The PDE inhibitors act distal to the beta receptor and are thus somewhat less susceptible to this problem. </p><p>Symptomatic improvement has been demonstrated in patients with advanced HF after treatment with a continuous infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> (at a rate of 5 to 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per min) for three to five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inotropic-agents-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. It has been suggested that the benefit can last for 30 days or more in selected cases, a phenomenon that has been called a &quot;dobutamine holiday&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inotropic-agents-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Possible mechanisms include a sustained improvement in myocardial contractility and left ventricular performance, a training-like effect on skeletal muscles, and an improvement in vascular endothelial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inotropic-agents-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Dobutamine did not affect mortality or improve functional status; it did, however, reduce hospitalization for all causes and for worsening of HF. Another controlled trial, the results of which have never been published, evaluated intermittent ambulatory dobutamine infusion in 60 patients; the trial was stopped prematurely because of <strong>excess mortality</strong> in the dobutamine group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inotropic-agents-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>However, as noted above, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milrinone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milrinone</a> may also increase mortality compared with placebo in patients who do not require inotropic support at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inotropic-agents-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].
