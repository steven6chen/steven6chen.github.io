Classification schemes in HF (such as New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class) do not account for the <span class=\"nowrap\">dynamic/tidal</span> nature of volume status in hemodialysis patients. It would not be unusual for the same patient to have a higher (more severe) NYHA class 3 before hemodialysis session compared with shortly after. A proposed functional classification scheme, specifically for dialysis patients, was developed by the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) XI Workgroup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-of-heart-failure-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The three elements of the proposed HF staging system are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standardized echocardiographic evidence of structural <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> functional cardiac abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F103903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103903 \">table 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspnea occurring in the absence of primary lung disease, including isolated pulmonary hypertension (ie, not due to elevation in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Response of congestive symptoms to renal replacement therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">(RRT)/ultrafiltration</span></p><p/><p>The validity of using standardized echocardiographic evidence of structural <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> functional heart disease for staging was demonstrated in a study that showed that, after multiple adjustments, right ventricular dysfunction was independently associated with death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-of-heart-failure-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A major impediment to treatment is that the general approach and recommendations for the management of HF in the general population may not apply or necessarily be safe in dialysis patients with HF. While standard HF therapy for patients with systolic dysfunction is based largely upon demonstrated mortality benefit in clinical trials, evidence to support the safety and efficacy of such treatment is limited for the dialysis population. Evidence to guide management of diastolic HF is limited even in patients with normal renal function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite this, identifying and correcting reversible factors that may contribute to HF as well as interventions directed at ameliorating the impact of myocardial dysfunction may improve symptoms and outcomes in the dialysis population. As an example, revascularization of obstructive coronary artery disease lesions, maintenance of target hemoglobin levels and presumed optimal dry weight, identification of the best individual dialysis prescription, and administration of appropriate pharmacologic therapy may improve patient comfort and ultimately will improve outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Identifying associated conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many possible conditions may underlie or contribute to HF and should be sought and, if possible, corrected.

Clearly, this approach cannot be used among most hemodialysis patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of diuretics in patients with heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Optimal volume control is a significant factor in the management of HF in hemodialysis patients. We agree with the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines that the maintenance of euvolemia is a major component of effective treatment in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-of-heart-failure-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, the fluctuating nature of fluid volume in relationship to the hemodialysis schedule makes the maintenance of sustained euvolemia difficult. A practical balance between the avoidance of interdialytic hypervolemia and intradialytic hypovolemia must be sought individually. The definition of euvolemia and the approach to attaining this state in general hemodialysis patients are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertension-in-dialysis-patients#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertension in dialysis patients&quot;, section on 'Achieving optimal dry weight'</a>.)</p><p>To achieve postdialysis euvolemia among patients with myocardial dysfunction, hypotension during dialysis is common and a difficult problem to overcome, especially when interdialytic fluid gain is large. As a first step, we use echocardiography to help accurately assess intravascular volume and left ventricular function and detect any underlying valve disease. Although bioimpedance is used by some nephrologists to assess extravascular volume, its use is controversial, and we consider its role to be unclear.</p><p>The use of a cool 35&ordm;C dialysate bath has also been associated with a reduction in symptomatic episodes due to increases in both systemic vascular resistance and cardiac contractility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intradialytic hypotension in an otherwise stable patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient#H6717508\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intradialytic hypotension in an otherwise stable patient&quot;, section on 'Second-line approach'</a>.)</p><p>Among chronically hypotensive patients, a difficult question is how to optimally manage the hypotensive effects of pharmacologic agents. The most common (but not evidence-based) strategy is to alter dosing schedules on dialysis days, particularly withholding the dose before dialysis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy for systolic dysfunction'</a> below.)</p><p>With difficult-to-manage HF, increasing the duration of hemodialysis or instituting daily hemodialysis (eg, nocturnal hemodialysis) is likely to provide better volume control and minimize intradialytic hypotension than that provided by a standard dialysis schedule. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technical-aspects-of-nocturnal-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Technical aspects of nocturnal hemodialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outcomes-associated-with-nocturnal-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outcomes associated with nocturnal hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacologic therapy for systolic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the nondialysis patient, standard medical therapy for HF due to systolic dysfunction generally includes diuretics as well as a number of medications that have been demonstrated to improve survival in patients with HF without renal failure, including a beta blocker, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an aldosterone receptor antagonist. However, the use of many of these agents is limited in hemodialysis patients due to a number of issues, including the loss of kidney function and the frequent occurrence of intradialytic hypotension among dialysis patients with significant ventricular dysfunction. Despite this, limited data suggest that some of these agents are associated with improved survival among dialysis patients.</p><p>We recommend the use of beta blockers in dialysis patients with severe dilated cardiomyopathy, which we define as a left ventricular ejection fraction of &le;40 percent. We use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carvedilol</a> as the preferred beta blocker. Although the only positive placebo-controlled trial in dialysis patients with HF used an ejection fraction cut-off of &lt;35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-of-heart-failure-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], we feel that, despite the lack of evidence in the dialysis population, an ejection fraction cutoff of &le;40 percent, as is used in the nondialysis population, is reasonable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, although no prospective, controlled studies have been performed in dialysis patients with HF, we also use ACE inhibitors in this subpopulation. This is based primarily upon its benefits observed in patients with HF and normal or near-normal renal function.</p><p>The addition of an ARB may be considered for patients who have persistent symptoms of HF on a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor. (See <a href=\"#H15279392\" class=\"local\">'Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors plus angiotensin II receptor blockers'</a> below.)</p><p>Issues surrounding the benefits and adverse effects associated with the use of some of these agents in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Beta blockers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the dialysis population, a single prospective, randomized trial showed that beta blockers reduced the risk of death in those with dilated cardiomyopathy. In that trial, 114 dialysis patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carvedilol</a> or placebo, in addition to standard therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-of-heart-failure-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. At two years, mortality was significantly lower in the beta-blocker group (52 versus 73 percent) and a trend toward a reduction in sudden death (hazard ratio [HR] 0.76).</p><p>Other evidence of a benefit associated with beta blockers comes from a randomized trial that showed that, compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a> was associated with a higher risk of serious cardiovascular events and hospitalizations for heart failure among 200 hemodialysis patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and hypertension (incidence rate ratios 2.36 and 3.13, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-of-heart-failure-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Because of these data, this study was terminated early at the recommendation of an independent safety monitoring board. A caveat of this trial is that blood pressure control was worse in the lisinopril group, which complicates interpretation of results.</p><p>Based on the study cited above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-of-heart-failure-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], we and the 2005 KDOQI guidelines suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carvedilol</a> as the preferred beta blocker in dialysis patients with severe dilated cardiomyopathy, defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;35 percent. Based on current classification of HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF) (ie, 40 percent for HFREF), it would be reasonable to liberalize our recommendations to &le;40 percent rather than 35 percent, even in the dialysis population. New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class is not as clinically useful as in patients without ESRD, since symptoms associated with HF may also be due to other factors in ESRD such as anemia or uremic cardiomyopathy and dialysis can generally alleviate significant fluid overload associated with HF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death-in-dialysis-patients#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death in dialysis patients&quot;, section on 'Identification of the high-risk dialysis patient'</a>.)</p><p>Beta blockers that are poorly dialyzed (like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carvedilol</a>) may provide a greater benefit than easily dialyzed beta blockers (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>). In a retrospective cohort study of 6588 hemodialysis patients, compared with a poorly dialyzed beta blocker (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bisoprolol</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>), initiation of a highly dialyzable beta blocker (atenolol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acebutolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acebutolol</a>, or metoprolol) was associated with increased mortality (relative risk 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-of-heart-failure-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. This result was not observed among nondialysis patients.</p><p>A review of the evidence concerning various beta blockers in the general population is available elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-beta-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Beta blockers must be initiated at very low doses to minimize the risk of hemodynamic deterioration. This is particularly the case in patients who have intradialytic or sustained hypotension.

In addition, there are little data on the use of these agents in dialysis patients without HF. In the randomized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fosinopril</a> in Dialysis (FOSIDIAL) trial, there was a nonsignificant trend toward fewer cardiovascular events with fosinopril compared with placebo among dialysis patients with left ventricular hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-of-heart-failure-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Although clinical data are lacking, the favorable effects of ACE inhibitors on neurohormonal activation, hemodynamics, ventricular remodeling, and regression of left ventricular hypertrophy may conceivably translate into a reduction in cardiovascular events in dialysis patients with left ventricular dysfunction and HF.</p><p>Despite the paucity of data in dialysis patients with HF, we suggest the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and HF. This recommendation is based primarily upon its benefits derived in patients with HF and normal or near-normal renal function.</p><p>As always, dosing of any agent must be appropriate for kidney function. If this therapy is used, careful monitoring of serum potassium concentration should be employed as the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with a significantly higher risk of hyperkalemia (defined as a predialysis serum potassium concentration of 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> or higher) in dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-of-heart-failure-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

After multivariate adjustment, ARBs significantly reduced fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease events (HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.33-0.79).

Cardiovascular events and mortality rates were significantly higher in the control group (46 versus 16 percent and 19 versus 0 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p>We suggest the use of ARBs in ACE-intolerant dialysis patients with HF. This approach is similar to that utilized in the general HF population.

On one hand, a multicenter trial showed a benefit of dual therapy on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and HF-related hospital admissions among 332 hemodialysis patients with ejection fractions less than 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-of-heart-failure-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. All patients were on an ACE inhibitor at the start of the trial, and 60 percent of patients were on a beta blocker. After a two-week run-in phase to test tolerance to the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telmisartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telmisartan</a>, drug dose was titrated to a target of 80 mg daily.</p><p>At a median follow-up time of 36 months, compared with placebo, the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telmisartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telmisartan</a> was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.32-0.82), cardiovascular death (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.38-0.61), and HF-related hospital admissions (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.19-0.51). The study drug was discontinued because of adverse events in 27 patients (16 percent) who were taking telmisartan compared with 18 patients (11 percent) who were taking placebo. Hyperkalemia that required discontinuation of the study drug was observed in five patients (3 percent) who were taking telmisartan versus two patients (1 percent) who were taking placebo.</p><p>In contrast, a large, observational study suggested that dual therapy with an ACE inhibitor plus an ARB was associated with poorer cardiovascular outcomes among hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-of-heart-failure-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In this study, 701 patients treated with an ACE inhibitor plus an ARB were compared with 8624 patients who were treated with either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB plus an additional antihypertensive agent that was neither an ACE inhibitor nor an ARB. After adjusting for age, race, comorbidities, and multiple other variables, combination renin-angiotensin system blockade therapy (ie, ACE inhibitor plus ARB) was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular death compared with combination therapy with an ARB plus a non-ACE inhibitor antihypertensive agent.</p><p>The latter study is limited by its observational design. In addition, unlike the randomized trial cited above, in this observational cohort study, the cardiac ejection fractions were not known, so the authors could not specifically examine the effect of dual therapy among hemodialysis patients with a reduced ejection fraction. Further prospective, randomized, controlled studies are needed to clarify the clinical efficacy and safety of ACE inhibitor plus ARB combination therapy. Until additional studies are available, such combination treatment should be restricted to carefully selected patients with ejection fractions less than 40 percent.</p><p>Based upon these data, we suggest that an ARB be considered for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and ejection fractions of less than 35 percent who have persistent symptoms of HF on a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor. The combination of an ACE inhibitor and ARB should be used with caution among hemodialysis patients because of the risks of hyperkalemia and intradialytic hypotension.

There is particular concern over the risk of hyperkalemia, especially when used concurrently with ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Since aldosterone receptor antagonists may decrease potassium excretion in the colon as well as the translocation of potassium into tissues, the risk of hyperkalemia exists even for anuric dialysis patients.</p><p>This issue was addressed in a noninferiority multicenter trial from Canada that randomly assigned 146 hemodialysis patients to 50 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eplerenone</a> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-of-heart-failure-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. At 13 weeks, there was no difference between groups in the rate of drug discontinuation due to hyperkalemia or hypotension (4 versus 2.8 percent in the eplerenone and placebo group, respectively). However, more patients in the eplerenone group developed hyperkalemia (11.7 compared with 2.6 percent in the placebo group).</p><p>The effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eplerenone</a> on cardiovascular outcomes was not assessed in this trial.</p><p>The use of such agents cannot be recommended in dialysis patients with HF until specific evidence addressing their efficacy and safety in dialysis patients is available. One trial is designed to test the efficacy and safety of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> for reduction in cardiovascular events in dialysis patients with left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-of-heart-failure-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We principally use beta blockers and ACE inhibitors (or ARBs) in dialysis patients with HF. The initiation of these agents can present special problems in hemodialysis patients. It has been our experience that the higher the predialysis blood pressure, the easier it is to uptitrate these agents. As an example, a dialysis patient with hypertension is a prime candidate for these agents since these drugs are effective antihypertensive agents and will therefore treat both HF and hypertension.</p><p>By comparison, patients with chronically low blood pressures (such as predialysis systolic blood pressures less than 100 mmHg) are challenging as these agents may not be well tolerated in the setting of dialysis. To avoid intradialytic hypotension, we may empirically modify dosing schedules, such as not administering these agents before dialysis on hemodialysis days.</p><p>It is not clear which class of agent should be started first, but we would favor the beta blocker as more titration steps are likely to be needed and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carvedilol</a> is the only drug demonstrated to improve survival in dialysis patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, although the data are limited. Such therapy must be initiated at very low doses to minimize the risk of hemodynamic deterioration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-beta-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;, section on 'Initiation of therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-dysfunction-in-end-stage-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial dysfunction in end-stage renal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients who tolerate the beta blocker, we suggest initiation of the (low-dose) ACE inhibitor during the &quot;middle&quot; of the beta-blocker uptitration process. The agents should be uptitrated in tandem, with one drug change at a time. We use ARBs in ACE-intolerant patients.</p><p>Slow uptitration of these agents is required in dialysis patients and is generally done at approximately every two- to three-week intervals, if tolerated. Slower uptitration may be necessary among patients who are chronically hypotensive (such as predialysis systolic blood pressures less than 100 mmHg). The rate of uptitration is determined empirically, given the difficulty in maintaining adequate blood pressures in some of these patients.</p><p>The addition of an ARB may be considered for patients who have persistent symptoms of HF on a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor. (See <a href=\"#H15279392\" class=\"local\">'Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors plus angiotensin II receptor blockers'</a> above.)</p><p>As previously mentioned, dosing of any drug must be appropriate for renal failure. Issues surrounding the initiation of beta-blocker therapy and the inability to reach the target dose with beta-blocker therapy are discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-beta-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;, section on 'Initiation of therapy'</a>). Careful monitoring of serum potassium concentration must also be employed since the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs has been associated with a significantly higher risk of hyperkalemia (defined as a predialysis serum potassium concentration of 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> or higher). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A difficult question is how to optimally manage the hypotensive effects of these agents in chronically hypotensive patients. As previously mentioned, we may empirically modify dosing schedules to avoid intradialytic hypotension, such as not administering these agents before dialysis on hemodialysis days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (diastolic heart failure)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients with HF with preserved left ventricular systolic function (diastolic HF), few data are available to guide treatment, even in patients with normal renal function. Management of these patients is based upon addressing the following factors that may contribute to diastolic dysfunction (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart rate control</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood volume</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial ischemia</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both renal failure and HF are associated with anemia. Although the presence of anemia is associated with higher mortality risk in patients with HF, it is uncertain whether anemia is an independent predictor of increased mortality or it reflects more advanced disease and more extensive comorbidities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-anemia-in-adults-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to anemia in adults with heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although the literature is inconclusive, hemoglobin values that are approximately between 10 and 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (ie, hematocrit between 30 and 36 percent) appear to provide a better quality of life and perhaps the best patient survival compared with values below this range. An increased risk of adverse outcomes with normal or near-normal hemoglobin levels has been noted in hemodialysis patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents compared with those with hemoglobin around 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. We recommend <strong>NOT</strong> targeting hemoglobin levels above 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. Target hemoglobin values for hemodialysis patients who are treated with erythropoietin-stimulating agents are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-anemia-in-hemodialysis-patients#H2992892097\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of anemia in hemodialysis patients&quot;, section on 'Target levels'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with systolic HF are usually not referred for or undergo kidney transplantation, because of the perceived increased risk for poor outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-of-heart-failure-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, some data suggest that kidney transplantation may result in increased left ventricular function and improved survival in these patients. This was illustrated in a study in which over 100 dialysis patients with decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (&le;40 percent) and HF underwent kidney transplantation between 1998 and 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapy-of-heart-failure-in-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. There were no perioperative deaths. Repeat radionuclide ventriculograms were performed at 6 and 12 months postsurgery, and the mean duration of follow-up was 37 months.</p><p>At 12 months, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction had increased from 32 to 52 percent, and more than two-thirds of patients achieved a left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 50 percent. The latter patients had a significant decrease in NYHA class of HF and lower risk for death or hospitalization. However, patients with ejection fractions less than 30 percent did not typically normalize, and the heart function of those waitlisted 18 to 24 plus months also did not improve.</p><p>Given that ejection fraction can improve with medical therapy in some dialysis patients with HF, it is important to reassess possible eligibility for kidney transplantation after optimal medical therapy has been implemented. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy for systolic dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p>Thus, after excluding obstructive coronary artery disease, we reassess left ventricular function at 12 weeks after the final uptitration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carvedilol</a> among patients with a low ejection fraction. In our experience, a significant percentage of patients have an impressive rise in left ventricular ejection fraction (ie, &ge;10 ejection fraction points) after optimization of carvedilol and other medical therapies, and some are reactivated for the kidney transplant waitlist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart-kidney transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combined heart-kidney transplants may be most appropriate for selected dialysis patients with severe irreversible cardiac dysfunction.
