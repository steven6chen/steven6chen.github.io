An individual experiencing depersonalization may report feeling like an automaton or as if in a dream or as if watching himself or herself in a movie. Depersonalized individuals may report the sense of being an outside observer of their mental processes or their body. They often report feeling a loss of control over their thoughts, perceptions, and actions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2819675276\"><span class=\"h2\">Derealization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Derealization is a subjective sense of detachment or unreality regarding the world around them (eg, individuals or objects are experienced as unreal, dreamlike, foggy, lifeless, or visually distorted).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1501612982\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF PHARMACOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is limited robust evidence from randomized trials on the efficacy of medication for <span class=\"nowrap\">depersonalization/derealization</span> disorder. Benzodiazepines, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naltrexone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naltrexone</a> may be useful to treat specific target or comorbid symptoms as an adjunct to psychotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-of-depersonalization-derealization-disorder/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1295561029\"><span class=\"h1\">SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants are unlikely to be of major benefit for <span class=\"nowrap\">depersonalization/derealization</span> disorder (DDD) symptoms, but may be useful to reduce comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms if prominent. It has been postulated that these symptoms, if untreated, can fuel an intensification of depersonalization and derealization symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-of-depersonalization-derealization-disorder/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3822824311\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only randomized trial comparing an SSRI with placebo in patients with DDD did not find the SSRI to be efficacious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-of-depersonalization-derealization-disorder/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The trial compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> with placebo in 50 patients with DDD.

Time to onset of clinically meaningful action for an SRI varies by patient, but can be as long as four to six weeks, or longer.

However, this has not been studied in treatment for DDD. </p><p>Liver function tests (liver function test; aspartate aminotransferase test [AST], alanine aminotransferase test [ALT], and total bilirubin) should be checked at baseline. The medication should not be started if values are greater than five times the upper limit of normal.
