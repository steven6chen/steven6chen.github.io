The adrenal glands are small organs that are located on top of each kidney (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67279\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67279 \">figure 1</a>). Normally, the adrenal glands make substances called hormones. These hormones do many things in the body, such as help keep blood sugar levels and blood pressure normal. In people with Addison's disease, the adrenal glands do not work properly and do not make enough hormones. This causes symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1752427458\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Addison's disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with Addison's disease have the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired or weak</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss and loss of appetite</p><p/><p>Other common symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Darkening of the skin, especially on the face, neck, and back of the hands</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling light-headed or dizzy when standing or sitting up</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle and joint pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Craving salt</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing hair from the armpits and pubic area (in women)</p><p/><p>Sometimes, a person's symptoms can become severe and life-threatening. Doctors call this &quot;adrenal crisis.&quot; Symptoms of adrenal crisis can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever and weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, vomiting, and stomach pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passing out, or going into shock</p><p/><p>Adrenal crisis usually occurs when a person's body is under stress, such as from an infection or injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1752427465\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for Addison's disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse might order different tests to check for Addison's disease. These involve checking your cortisol levels. Cortisol is an important hormone that the adrenal glands normally make. In people with Addison's disease, the glands don't make enough of it. Tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests that measure cortisol &ndash; Sometimes your doctor or nurse will give you a hormone shot, then measure your cortisol level 30 or 60 minutes later.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A saliva test that measures cortisol</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1752427472\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Addison's disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Addison's disease is treated with hormone medicines to replace the hormones that are missing in the body. People usually need 2 different medicines, which must be taken every day for the rest of their life.</p><p>It is important to let your doctor or nurse know if you have any side effects from the medicines or develop any new symptoms.</p><p>Your doctor might also prescribe emergency medicine that you should keep with you at all times in case you have adrenal crisis. This medicine comes in the form of a shot. If you think you are having adrenal crisis, use the medicine and then <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>. Your doctor might recommend that you also use this emergency medicine if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a major injury, for example if you break a bone or lose a lot of blood</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pass out</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomit up your daily medicine</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1752427479\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I get sick or know that I am going to have surgery?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you get sick or know that you are going to have surgery, talk with your doctor or nurse. For example, if you are vomiting and unable to keep your medicines down, let your doctor or nurse know. When people are sick or have surgery, their body might need more adrenal hormones than usual. Your doctor or nurse will tell you if you need to increase your medicines, and how and when to do it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1752427486\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor or nurse. Most women with Addison's disease are able to get pregnant and have a baby. But your doctor will want to follow you closely. He or she might make changes in your medicine dose during the pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1752427493\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with Addison's disease lead an active and normal life.
