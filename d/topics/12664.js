While the majority of patients with bleeding peptic ulcers will stop bleeding spontaneously and not rebleed during hospitalization, a subgroup of patients is at high risk for recurrent hemorrhage and requires endoscopic therapy to decrease this risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If endoscopic therapy fails, interventional angiography or surgery may be required.</p><p>Despite advances in pharmacologic and endoscopic therapy, mortality rates have not improved. In a Danish study of 13,498 patients with peptic ulcer bleeding studied between 2004 and 2011, rates for successful endoscopic therapy were higher in 2010 to 2011 than in 2004 to 2006 (94 versus 89 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, rebleeding rates were lower (13 versus 18 percent). However, 30-day mortality did not improve (11 percent for both groups), though there was a trend toward decreased mortality after adjusting for potential confounders (adjusted relative risk 0.89, 95% CI 0.78-1.00).</p><p>The pharmacologic and endoscopic management of UGI bleeding due to peptic ulcer disease will be reviewed here. The discussion that follows is generally consistent with a multidisciplinary international consensus statement published in 2010, a 2012 <a href=\"https://www.asge.org/docs/default-source/education/practice_guidelines/doc-b4349a10-9b72-463e-ac70-f394c7aa20b4.pdf?sfvrsn=6&amp;token=u/CznNxH1a+n+HqAw/WW4Yg6gCiox5E82/xGq0BjZ8B9CvnvS19r25Xc9Q746FvmRb57egnYFmhiOST5I9OF1qQhddpqoeKgR/U9SYBWclzYEjGb9W2jLFdmcFTVOQRpVoau9hC93TXktboHpOiP3K8AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2573\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">guideline</a> issued by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, and a 2012 <a href=\"http://s3.gi.org/physicians/guidelines/UlcerBleeding.pdf&amp;token=CC43qenHHkOSrU4zyzZbbrTM/2nXSRnxO7Ee1qQADHf0vb9NAbDO+Xn/fOPbjFfGNIlZb29roQz9ZgMgjY1djq8AtSQsFLDSFqHlsS1NKKs=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2573\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">guideline</a> issued by the American College of Gastroenterology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].

Once the patient is stabilized, endoscopy is performed to diagnose high-risk lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52860\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52860 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

However, only patients with active bleeding (spurting or oozing), a nonbleeding visible vessel, or an adherent clot are generally considered to be at high risk for recurrent bleeding. Most patients with high-risk stigmata require endoscopic therapy to decrease the risk of recurrent bleeding. On the other hand, patients without these high-risk stigmata are considered low risk and do not require endoscopic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H97408859\" class=\"local\">'Inpatient versus outpatient management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97408859\"><span class=\"h1\">INPATIENT VERSUS OUTPATIENT MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hospitalization is required for patients at high-risk for recurrent bleeding, patients with evidence of severe upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding (hemodynamic instability, blood transfusion requirement), and patients at increased risk for complications should bleeding recur (eg, significant coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease, age over 65 years, patients taking antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications). Patients who are otherwise healthy and who are at low risk for recurrent UGI bleeding may be safely allowed to eat and be discharged from the hospital on oral antisecretory therapy once the effects of procedural sedation have worn off, provided that the patient is reliable and can promptly get medical care should bleeding recur. (See <a href=\"#H64438587\" class=\"local\">'Stigmata of recent hemorrhage'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-procedural-sedation-for-gastrointestinal-endoscopy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy&quot;, section on 'Post-procedure monitoring'</a>.) </p><p>In addition to findings at the time of endoscopy, risk stratification scores can help differentiate patients who require hospitalization from those who are appropriate for outpatient management. It is recommended in the International Consensus Recommendations that all patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding undergo risk stratification using a validated prognostic scale such as the Rockall score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-rockall-score-for-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), Blatchford score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-blatchford-score-for-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>), or AIMS65 score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The safety of early discharge for low-risk patients was demonstrated in a retrospective study with 72 patients with a bleeding duodenal ulcer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. All of the patients were under the age of 60 years and presented with stable vital signs. On endoscopy, they had no stigmata of recent hemorrhage or only flat spots seen. The mean hospital stay was 1.4 days, and there were no episodes of recurrent bleeding or significant drops in hemoglobin concentration two weeks after discharge. The investigators then performed a prospective study with 75 similar patients and discharged them on the same day of endoscopy. There were no episodes of recurrent bleeding or significant drops in hemoglobin one week after discharge.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57224533\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with bleeding peptic ulcers should receive acid suppressive treatment with a proton pump inhibitor. In general, a twice-daily intravenous (IV) proton pump inhibitor (PPI) should be given to all patients with suspected clinically significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding prior to endoscopy as part of their initial management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults#H5079756\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults&quot;, section on 'Acid suppression'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57224540\"><span class=\"h2\">Acid suppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment with PPIs leads to elevation of gastric pH levels, which stabilizes blood clots and improves clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/12-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-22</a>]. As a result, PPIs are recommended for all patients with peptic ulcer bleeding. Meta-analyses of randomized trials have failed to show superior outcomes with high-dose intravenous continuous infusion PPI administration compared with intermittent dosing, and using intermittent dosing rather than a continuous infusion could decrease resource utilization and cost. As a result, we use twice-daily dosing of a PPI. Prior to endoscopy, we give the PPI IV (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esomeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esomeprazole</a> 40 mg IV twice daily after an initial bolus of 80 mg IV), though oral formulations are a reasonable alternative if IV formulations are not available. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pantoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pantoprazole</a> and esomeprazole are the only intravenous formulations available in the United States, and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lansoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lansoprazole</a> has been removed from the world market. Our approach differs from 2010 and 2012 guidelines that recommend initial treatment with high-dose continuous infusion of IV PPIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H57226173\" class=\"local\">'Continuous versus intermittent dosing'</a> below and <a href=\"#H57224583\" class=\"local\">'Oral versus intravenous dosing'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients with high-risk stigmata of recent hemorrhage, the twice-daily IV PPI may be switched to a standard-dose oral PPI (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> 20 mg daily) 72 hours after endoscopy, provided there is no evidence of recurrent bleeding (see <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of persistent and recurrent bleeding'</a> below). However, a randomized trial suggested that twice-daily oral dosing may be preferable in patients at high risk of rebleeding. In the trial, patients with a Rockall score &ge;6 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-rockall-score-for-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) who received a twice&ndash;daily oral PPI had a lower rebleeding rate than those who received a once-daily oral PPI (11 versus 29 percent at 28 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Additional trials are needed to determine the optimal oral dosing regimen once the IV regimen is completed.</p><p>It is unlikely that an IV PPI would be of significant benefit in patients who do not have active bleeding or other high-risk stigmata (such as a visible vessel or adherent clots) because their risk of recurrent bleeding is low. Such patients may be switched to a standard-dose oral PPI immediately following endoscopy. The goal of treatment in low-risk patients should be directed at healing the ulcers and eliminating precipitating factors (such as <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcer-disease-management#H434386266\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peptic ulcer disease: Management&quot;, section on 'Initial management'</a>.)</p><p>Studies of H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) in bleeding peptic ulcers have produced mixed but generally disappointing results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/14,24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,24-27</a>]. A meta-analysis concluded that there was a possible minor benefit with IV H2RAs in bleeding gastric ulcers but no benefit with duodenal ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Recurrent bleeding was observed significantly less often in patients receiving omeprazole (7 versus 23 percent), a finding that led to early termination of the trial. A separate analysis based upon these data suggested that the addition of IV omeprazole was cost-effective compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second randomized trial (published after the meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]) included 638 patients admitted with upper gastrointestinal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

However, studies comparing high-dose continuous infusions with intermittent dosing of PPIs following endoscopic therapy have failed to show a difference in clinically relevant endpoints, and one meta-analysis found a trend toward a lower risk of rebleeding with intermittent dosing. In addition, giving the PPI intermittently could decrease resource utilization and cost compared with giving it as a continuous infusion. </p><p>A 2014 meta-analysis with 13 randomized trials comparing intermittent PPI administration with high-dose continuous infusion looked to see if intermittent administration was non-inferior to high-dose continuous infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

However, it is unlikely that the effect of IV PPIs would vary depending upon whether they were given before or after endoscopic therapy. As noted above, the benefit of PPIs in gastrointestinal bleeding is thought to be related to their effect on gastric pH (see <a href=\"#H57224540\" class=\"local\">'Acid suppression'</a> above), and small studies suggest that intermittent dosing and continuous infusion have similar effects on gastric pH for the first 12 hours after the initial bolus is given:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a crossover study, 10 critically ill patients were given either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> 80 mg IV followed by 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hour</span> for 24 hours or one dose of omeprazole 40 mg IV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Outcomes were similar between those who received IV esomeprazole and those who received oral esomeprazole with regard to recurrent bleeding within 30 days (8 versus 6 percent), blood transfusions (median 2 versus 1 units), need for repeat endoscopic therapy (1.7 versus 2.4 percent), and length of hospital stay (median 4.0 days for both).</p><p>High doses of PPIs given orally achieve adequate acid suppression more rapidly than standard doses (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> 20 mg daily), which may take several days to achieve adequate acid suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In addition, high-dose IV PPIs achieve adequate acid suppression more rapidly than high-dose oral PPIs.

Achievement of an intragastric pH &gt;6 was similar for IV and oral lansoprazole (68 versus 64 percent), but the group that received IV lansoprazole achieved a more rapid increase in pH, reaching a mean pH of 6 approximately one hour sooner than the group that received an oral PPI (after two to three hours compared with three to four hours). Whether such frequent dosing of the oral PPI was necessary to achieve comparable clinical outcomes is unclear, and we suggest that if a high-dose oral PPI is going to be used, that it be given twice daily.

A clinical benefit has been described in ulcer bleeding, but because of the effectiveness of PPI and endoscopic therapy, its role is generally limited to settings in which endoscopy is unavailable or as a means to help stabilize patients before definitive therapy can be performed.</p><p>Several studies have described the experience with these agents in patients with acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding. A meta-analysis of these trials suggested that somatostatin was associated with a reduced risk of continued bleeding (relative risk 0.53; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.63) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The risk also appeared to be reduced with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a>, although there were fewer studies. Thus, somatostatin or octreotide can be used as adjunctive therapy before endoscopy, or when endoscopy is unsuccessful, contraindicated, or unavailable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The doses used in the above studies were variable; a typical dose of somatostatin was 250 mcg given as a bolus followed by an infusion of 250 mcg per hour for three to seven days, while a typical dose of octreotide was 50 to 100 mcg given as a bolus followed by an infusion of 25 mcg per hour for up to three days. Of note, the dose of octreotide used is lower than that used for variceal bleeding (50 mcg bolus followed by an infusion of 50 mcg per hour), so if there is concern prior to the endoscopy that the bleed could be due to varices, the higher dose of octreotide should be used.

On the other hand, ulcers with a clean base or a flat pigmented spot are at low risk of recurrent bleeding (3 to 5 percent for clean-based ulcers and 7 to 10 percent for ulcers with a flat spot) and should not be treated endoscopically (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74032%7EGAST%2F52497\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74032 graphicRef52497 \">picture 4A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

A traditional dictum has been to leave these clots in situ and manage patients medically. More recent experience suggests that removing the clot (eg, using a cold guillotine technique with a polypectomy snare) and then treating the underlying ulcer stigmata can significantly reduce the risk of recurrent bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].

We usually do not exceed 20 mL of epinephrine (1:10,000 dilution) injection or more than six pulses of thermal coagulation.

Surgery or angiography-guided intervention is indicated for patients who fail endoscopic therapy (persistent bleeding or recurrent bleeding after two therapeutic endoscopies).</p><p>This approach was supported by a randomized trial that included 92 patients with recurrent bleeding after endoscopic therapy who were randomly assigned to repeat endoscopic therapy or surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Long-term control of bleeding was achieved in 35 of 48 patients (73 percent) treated with repeated endoscopic therapy.

In addition, patients who presented with active hemorrhage, shock, and the lowest hemoglobin concentrations did less well than those without these risk factors. Factors that did <strong>not</strong> predict the outcome of endoscopic therapy were a history of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> use, coagulopathy, previous peptic ulceration, and concomitant cardiorespiratory disease.

Large ulcers tend to have larger blood vessels (&gt;2 to 3 mm), and ulcers in the posterior duodenal bulb also may have a large vessel (gastroduodenal artery).

Emergency surgery for bleeding peptic ulcer disease involves oversewing of the ulcer (to ligate the bleeding artery) plus truncal vagotomy (to decrease acid secretion) and pyloroplasty (for gastric drainage).
