Weight loss improves alveolar ventilation (sometimes normalizing the awake arterial carbon dioxide tension [PaCO<sub>2</sub>] and arterial oxygen tension [PaO<sub>2</sub>]), reduces the risk of cardiorespiratory complications (eg, pulmonary arterial hypertension and left ventricular function), improves nocturnal oxyhemoglobin saturation, decreases the frequency of respiratory events (ie, apneas, hypopneas) during sleep if the patient has coexisting OSA, and improves pulmonary function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/2-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-9</a>]. These benefits appear to occur regardless of whether the weight loss was due to lifestyle modification (ie, diet, exercise) or surgery. (See <a href=\"#H3202580773\" class=\"local\">'Additional treatments targeted at weight loss'</a> below.)</p><p>Weight loss should be supervised and controlled. Rapid, unsupervised weight loss is discouraged because it is generally not sustained and may have serious side effects (eg, cholelithiasis). There are no reliable predictors of the exact amount of weight that must be lost to ameliorate nocturnal upper airway dysfunction and cardiorespiratory failure in OHS. Individuals with OHS are usually morbidly obese (ie, more than 50 percent above ideal body weight), and clinical experience suggests that weight loss of more than 100 pounds is often needed before clinically significant improvement is seen. </p><p>All patients with OHS should make lifestyle modifications to lose weight. Lifestyle modifications refer to various combinations of dietary change, exercise, and behavioral modification, which are described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Dietary therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-role-of-physical-activity-and-exercise\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Role of physical activity and exercise&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-behavioral-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Behavioral therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Individuals with OHS may have more difficulty maintaining long term weight loss than persons with uncomplicated obesity because of exercise limitations related to their chronic respiratory failure. Thus, while lifestyle modifications are necessary in patients with OHS, they are seldom sufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] to achieve and maintain a degree of weight loss that satisfactorily improves alveolar ventilation and sleep-related breathing disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Compared with positive airway pressure, weight loss is less effective than lifestyle modification alone at improving symptoms, polysomnographic parameters, hypercapnia, and some pulmonary function measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1248615993\"><span class=\"h1\">SECOND LINE THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Second line therapies are reserved for patients with OHS who fail or do not tolerate first line therapies (ie, noninvasive positive airway pressure [PAP] and weight loss measures). Bariatric surgery is also an option for those who wish to discontinue or reduce the need for PAP therapy. In general, these are only considered after aggressive attempts have been made to optimize PAP therapy. In general, these therapies are suboptimal and associated with increased risk of adverse effects. Choosing among them depends upon factors including severity of OHS, degree of obesity, likelihood of efficacy or adverse effects, and patient preferences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1955826132\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatments targeted at obesity hypoventilation and sleep disordered breathing</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5573090\"><span class=\"h3\">Tracheostomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the introduction of noninvasive PAP therapy, tracheostomy for treatment of OHS is now rarely necessary. Tracheostomy itself (without ventilation through the device) may be effective in patients with OHS and coexisting OSA because it relieves upper airway obstruction during sleep with subsequent improvement in alveolar ventilation and the arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) during wakefulness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, not all patients return to eucapnia following tracheostomy because upper airway obstruction is just one factor responsible for alveolar hypoventilation in this population; other factors (eg, decreased respiratory compliance and ventilatory muscle strength) are unaltered by tracheostomy. In keeping with this hypothesis is our experience and available data, which suggest that, despite tracheostomy placement, most patients still require nocturnal ventilation for residual OSA through the device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Tracheostomy alone cannot be used to treat OHS with sleep-related hypoventilation unless the tracheostomy is also used for nocturnal ventilation. </p><p>In addition to the typical risk and complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>], tracheostomy in the obese individual is technically more difficult because debulking of excess adipose tissue may be required in order to securely insert a standard tracheostomy tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In addition, it may be associated with a higher risk of displacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18</a>].

Weight loss medications are potentially harmful and often insufficient, so we believe that they should only be used on a case-by-case basis after a careful evaluation of the potential benefits and risks to the individual patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3541537006\"><span class=\"h3\">Bariatric surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For morbidly obese patients with OHS, considerable attention has been directed towards bariatric surgery, since lifestyle modifications alone are generally insufficient and pharmacological therapy is of uncertain efficacy and safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although no study has specifically enrolled patients with OHS, improvements in gas exchange, OSA, and indices of pulmonary hypertension have been reported in obese individuals undergoing bariatric surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/2,4-6,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-6,8,9</a>]. However, patients with OHS may be excluded from surgery due to the presence of comorbid conditions (eg, pulmonary hypertension, or severe morbid obesity itself). The indications, contraindications, techniques, and complications of bariatric surgery and preoperative evaluation of OSA prior to bariatric surgery, including recommendations on consultation with a sleep expert <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> repeat polysomnography, are reviewed in detail separately.

Even with optimal titration of nocturnal noninvasive PAP preoperatively, patients with sleep-disordered breathing may be at further risk for hypoventilation postoperatively due to the effects of surgery, general anesthesia, or medications, such that empiric adjustments to PAP settings may be needed for a short period. Postoperative management of patients with obesity and OSA is discussed separately.

However, many of the approved weight loss medications may initially only achieve weight loss of 5 to 10 kg over 3 to 12 months before the weight loss plateaus, which is typically not enough to improve or eliminate awake hypoventilation. In addition, most patients regain their weight if the medications are discontinued. Indications, efficacy, and adverse effects of weight loss pharmacotherapy are discussed separately.

This because oxygen may increase hypercapnia, as demonstrated in two studies of stable newly diagnosed untreated patients with OHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In addition, although supplemental oxygen, will treat sleep-related hypoxemia, it does not address the pathophysiologic contributors to awake alveolar hypoventilation, including altered chemoresponsiveness, nocturnal upper airway occlusion, and impaired respiratory mechanics. </p><p>In situations in which a patient with OHS requires supplemental oxygen (eg, for comorbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe nocturnal desaturations unresponsive to noninvasive positive airway pressure therapy [PAP]), it should be used concurrently with optimally titrated PAP therapy. Monitoring the need for oxygen is important since hypercapnia may improve and diurnal oxygen requirements may decrease with adherence to PAP therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. &#160;</p><p>If supplemental oxygen is necessary and the patient cannot tolerate PAP, the patient should be carefully monitored (clinically <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with polysomnography) to detect potential adverse effects of hypercapnia on hemodynamics and symptoms.

If prescribed, it should be done on a trial basis only in conjunction with optimally titrated PAP. &#160;</p><p>Progestins (eg, medroxyprogesterone) alone have been shown to improve but do not eliminate awake hypercapnia and hypoxemia in patients with OHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a> has been shown to improve alveolar ventilation in patients with OHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/13,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,28,29</a>]. However these agents do not affect all of the pathogenic contributors to OHS, in particular the recurrent upper airway collapse that occurs during sleep in patients who have coexisting obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>] or the altered respiratory mechanics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Reassessment of OHS is performed after significant weight loss has occurred (eg, usually within one to two years after bariatric surgery). An ABG should be performed to examine the awake partial arterial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>), as well as in-laboratory polysomnography to assess for accurate settings so that adjustments can be made, if necessary. Early, rapid weight loss (typically 45 to 70 percent of excess body weight) during the first postoperative year is often associated with improvement of OHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, this has not been universal and some patients have residual OSA despite amelioration of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/2,4,11,44-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,11,44-49</a>]. Thus, discontinuation of noninvasive PAP therapy after weight loss should <strong>not</strong> be performed unless polysomnography demonstrates that residual OSA warranting therapy is absent. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4211744432\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Morbidity and mortality in untreated patients with OHS is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of obesity hypoventilation syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with OHS, we recommend a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach targeted at the immediate initiation of noninvasive positive airway pressure (PAP) together with lifestyle modifications for weight loss. (See <a href=\"#H2738498\" class=\"local\">'Positive airway pressure'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive positive airway pressure therapy of the obesity hypoventilation syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with OHS who fail or do not tolerate first line therapies in whom aggressive attempts have been made to optimize PAP therapy, options include tracheostomy for the treatment of sleep disordered breathing and bariatric surgery or rarely medication for weight loss. In general, these therapies are suboptimal and associated with increased risk of adverse effects. Choosing among them depends upon factors including severity of OHS, obesity, likelihood of efficacy or adverse effects, and patient preferences. (See <a href=\"#H715738\" class=\"local\">'Weight loss and lifestyle modifications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1248615993\" class=\"local\">'Second line therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with OHS in whom supplemental oxygen is indicated (eg, for significant sleep-related oxyhemoglobin desaturation or for hypoxemic respiratory failure), we suggest that it be administered in conjunction with noninvasive PAP, based upon the rationale that supplemental oxygen alone may worsen hypercapnia. Oxygen should <strong>not</strong> be administered as a sole therapy for OHS. Respiratory stimulants (ie, progestins and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a>) are adjunctive therapies that are a last resort for patients who continue to have serious alveolar hypoventilation despite PAP therapy and weight loss. However, such agents are typically minimally effective and are associated with adverse effects. (See <a href=\"#H2012485803\" class=\"local\">'Therapies of limited value or associated with harm'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with OHS should be advised to abstain from alcohol and sedatives (eg, benzodiazepines, opiates, muscle relaxants, and barbiturates) which can contribute to hypoventilation and ameliorate the effects of PAP therapy. In addition, the clinician should identify and treat comorbid conditions that may contribute to hypoventilation (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypothyroidism) or can complicate OHS (eg, pulmonary hypertension). (See <a href=\"#H2193021721\" class=\"local\">'Supportive therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with OHS should be followed clinically for the response to noninvasive PAP <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> weight loss (eg, every six months). Notably, duration of therapy, and therefore follow-up, are typically indeterminate and often lifelong since the degree of support may change over time depending upon factors including weight <span class=\"nowrap\">loss/gain,</span> medications, development or treatment of contributing comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H4121231023\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-positive-airway-pressure-therapy-of-the-obesity-hypoventilation-syndrome#H2377266325\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive positive airway pressure therapy of the obesity hypoventilation syndrome&quot;, section on 'Assessing treatment response'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Morbidity and mortality in untreated patients with OHS is high with most deaths due to cardiovascular complications including pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure.
