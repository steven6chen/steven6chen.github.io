In a trial in which 300 adults were randomly assigned to open suture or mesh repair of a primary umbilical hernia 1 to 4 cm in diameter, suture repair resulted in more recurrences at 30 months (12 versus 4 percent) but similar postoperative pain and complication rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-general-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. When technically feasible, we recommend mesh repair for all ventral hernias, including umbilical hernias larger than 1 cm; smaller primary ventral hernias can be repaired with suture or mesh.

In a prospective cohort study of over 20,000 patients undergoing elective unilateral groin hernia repair between 2012 and 2015, groin pain interfering with daily activities persisted in 15 percent of patients at one year after surgery, higher than previously reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-general-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although fewer patients developed chronic pain after laparoscopic extraperitoneal repair (TEP) than with open anterior mesh (Lichtenstein) repair, more TEP patients required reoperation for recurrence at 2.5 years. For patients eligible for both open and laparoscopic repairs, we believe the choice should be based on surgeon and patient preferences and patients should be warned of possible chronic groin pain after either approach.

Adding to this body of literature, a retrospective database study of over one million surgical patients without a history of opioid misuse or ongoing opioid use identified opioid misuse (ie, opioid dependence, abuse, or overdose) in 0.6 percent of patients after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-general-surgery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The total duration of opioid prescription was the strongest predictor of misuse. Each prescription refill was associated with a 44 percent increase in the rate of misuse, and each additional week of opioid use increased the risk of misuse by 20 percent. While the risk of opioid misuse after surgery is low, the absolute number of patients affected is large because of the volume of surgery performed.

A study of three million cases and over 1800 types of operations in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQUIP) database identified a continuum of cardiac risk within these categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-general-surgery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As an example, within the high-risk category identified by standard risk screening tools, there was a threefold difference in risk between laparoscopic total abdominal colectomy and Whipple procedure. These data have been used to create a more granular risk screening model that might better inform decisions about evaluation and alternative treatment. The model requires external validation and may require institution-specific modification for application.

In an analysis of data from one the largest bariatric surgery registries (n = 130,000 patients), compared with LRYGB, LSG had one-half the risk of death (0.1 versus 0.2 percent), serious morbidity (6 versus 12 percent), and gastrointestinal leak (0.8 versus 1.6 percent) in the first 30 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-general-surgery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These data illustrate the relatively low morbidity and mortality of both procedures.

In two randomized trials, differences in weight loss and remission of type 2 diabetes between the two procedures were not clinically meaningful at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-general-surgery/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Given that most reoperations after LSG were for severe acid reflux and those after LRYGB were for internal hernias, clinicians and patients should consider these factors when choosing between LSG and LRYGB.

In a cohort study and a randomized trial, bariatric surgery patients (mostly gastric bypass) were more likely to have remission of hypertension and reduction in use of antihypertensive drugs, and less likely to develop new-onset hypertension than those treated medically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-general-surgery/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In a study of obese adults with type 2 diabetes, gastric bypass patients were more likely to achieve the composite end point (hemoglobin A1C &lt;7 percent, low-density lipoprotein &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> systolic blood pressure &lt;130 mmHg) than those managed with lifestyle and intensive medical management alone; however, the effect size diminished over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-general-surgery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In another study, bariatric surgery patients had lower all-cause mortality than those who did not (1.3 versus 2.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-general-surgery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Median follow-up ranged from four to almost seven years in these studies. Long-term follow-up is needed to determine the durability of the improvement in cardiovascular risk factors, particularly diabetes, and the effect on premature death.

However, a prospective study of over 700 women who underwent bariatric surgery reported that 4 percent actively tried to conceive, and 41 percent had unprotected intercourse during the first postsurgical year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-general-surgery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Risk factors for not using contraception included advancing age, being married or cohabitating, and preoperatively rating future pregnancy as important. This study highlights the need for preoperative and postoperative contraceptive counseling, particularly for women with risk factors for unprotected sexual activity.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has alerted health care providers of five reports of unanticipated deaths that occurred from 2016 to the present in patients with Orbera and ReShape balloons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-general-surgery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The five deaths all occurred within one month of balloon placement, but neither the root cause nor the incidence rate has been determined. Two other deaths due to esophageal and gastric perforation occurred in the same time period. Patients who receive intragastric balloon therapy should be closely monitored, especially during the first few week after implantation, and providers must ensure timely removal of the device at the end of the treatment period (typically six months).

At the 12-year follow-up, patients who underwent RYGB lost 45 kg, compared with 2.9 kg for those who sought but did not receive surgery, and 0 kg for controls who did not seek surgery. At 12 years, surgery also reduced the incidence of new-onset diabetes by 91 percent and led to remission of diabetes in 51 percent of patients with type 2 diabetes. The mean percentage weight loss was unchanged between 6 and 12 years after surgery, attesting to the durability of the procedure.

In one study, diabetes remission (glycated hemoglobin [A1C] &lt;6.5 percent off medications) was achieved in 49 percent of patients after RYGB and 28 percent after SG at a median of seven years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-general-surgery/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. By classifying diabetes preoperatively as mild, moderate, or severe by a nomogram based on four variables, the authors found that RYGB resulted in a higher rate of diabetes remission than SG for patients with moderate diabetes and a similar rate as SG for those with mild diabetes. For patients with severe diabetes, both procedures had low rates of diabetes remission. We believe the choice between RYGB and SG should be based on clinical factors in addition to glucose control, such as the patient's overall surgical risk and whether the patient has severe acid reflux, Crohn disease, or requires organ transplantation.

In a study of over 65,000 patients with a first episode of diverticulitis managed without colectomy, only 11.2 percent required readmission for recurrent diverticulitis in the next four years and only 0.9 and 0.75 percent required emergency and elective colon resections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-general-surgery/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These rates do not justify colon surgery for most patients. Following an initial episode of acute diverticulitis, we recommend surgery for patients who have had complications from diverticulitis (eg, abscess, obstruction, fistulization) or who are immunocompromised, as subsequent attacks in such patients are associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates. We suggest not performing surgery routinely in other individuals.

In a cohort study of over 45,000 elective colectomies with anastomosis, bowel preparation with MBP plus OA was associated with fewer surgical site infections (SSIs), fewer anastomotic leaks, and lower 30-day mortality compared with MBP only, OA only, or no preparation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-general-surgery/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. By multivariate analyses, MBP plus OA was associated with fewer SSIs in right, left, and segmental colectomies, and fewer anastomotic leaks in left and segmental colectomies. We suggest MBP plus OA for all patients undergoing elective colon resection.

Because some patients undergoing primary anastomosis received a protective stoma, the safety of primary anastomosis without a protective stoma could not be assessed. Until further data are available, we prefer a Hartmann's procedure for patients with Hinchey III or IV diverticulitis. Patients with Hinchey I or II disease can undergo a partial colon resection, followed by a primary anastomosis with or without a protective ostomy, depending upon the condition of the local tissue.

Antibiotic therapy is not routinely given to average-risk patients, because it failed to reduce the fistula rate in the only previous randomized trial. In a new randomized trial, a course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> after drainage of an anorectal abscess reduced the fistula rate from 30 to 14 percent at three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-general-surgery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. We believe high-risk patients (eg, signs of systemic infection, extensive cellulitis, diabetes, valvular heart disease, immunosuppression) should receive antibiotics after drainage of an anorectal abscess, but until further data are available, surgeons may use antibiotics at their discretion in average-risk patients.

About half of the patients in each group responded to catheter drainage alone without debridement.

DPPHR resulted in shorter operative time (4.7 versus 5.3 hours), but more readmissions due to chronic pancreatitis (27 versus 11 percent).
