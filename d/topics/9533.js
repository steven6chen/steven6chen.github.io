Some require elective or emergency surgery.</p><p>Many of the principles of peri- and intraoperative management are the same in transplant and non-transplant patients. However, there are a few important differences. It is strongly recommended that the transplant center be consulted prior to any planned surgical intervention in kidney transplant recipients.</p><p>Some of the general issues concerning non-transplant surgery in the transplant patient will be discussed here, as well as a few specific surgical problems. General discussions of the pre- and perioperative medical management of patients are presented separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician must integrate information from the history, physical examination, and laboratory tests to develop an initial estimate of perioperative risk. One major issue is the possible presence of significant coronary artery disease among those undergoing noncardiac surgery, a common finding among renal transplant recipients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease-in-the-renal-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for cardiovascular disease in the renal transplant recipient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A number of clinical and surgical determinants have been identified that allow cardiac risk stratification. The evaluation of patients with known or suspected cardiac disease prior to noncardiac surgery requires an appraisal of the patient's clinical risk profile in the context of the surgery to be performed and the attendant risks. Discussions of such an evaluation, as well as the general preoperative evaluation of patients, are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-medical-evaluation-of-the-adult-healthy-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative medical evaluation of the adult healthy patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the potential renal transplant recipient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When transplant recipients principally relied upon azathioprine-based immunosuppression regimens, chronic doses of corticosteroids were relatively high, with characteristic side effects observed in many transplant recipients. Adrenal suppression related to the higher maintenance doses of steroids was common, requiring the administration of high perioperative doses of corticosteroids.</p><p>Currently, with the advent of more potent maintenance immunosuppressive agents (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>), maintenance corticosteroids are either avoided entirely or the doses are markedly reduced. Thus, adrenal suppression has become much less of a problem.</p><p>In general, the administration of high doses of corticosteroids is usually unnecessary and may be relatively contraindicated. Giving such doses is not entirely benign and can occasionally be associated with gastritis, bleeding, induction of diabetes, and worsening of glycemic control (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>). Although cumbersome, not always practical, and somewhat unreliable, the cosyntropin (Cortrosyn) stimulation test can be used to help assess adrenal reserve. A discussion on how to assess such patients can be found elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/issues-relating-to-the-renal-allograft-recipient-undergoing-non-transplant-surgery/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid withdrawal&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following two regimens may be utilized in patients considered to have suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One approach is to provide high doses of glucocorticoid to those with proven or suspected adrenal insufficiency, starting at the time of induction of anesthesia. A continuous infusion of 10 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> per hour or the equivalent amount of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> eliminates the possibility of glucocorticoid deficiency as the cause of an adverse event (such as hypotension), thereby allowing the actual cause (hemorrhage or volume depletion) to be identified and treated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The glucocorticoid dose can be halved the day after surgery, and the maintenance dose usually can be resumed the second postoperative day. This amount of glucocorticoid for this amount of time carries a negligible risk of adverse effects; however, prolonged postoperative pharmacologic glucocorticoid therapy can mask symptoms and signs of infection and produce undesirable side effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The other regimen utilizes parenteral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> &quot;boosts.&quot; Generally, 100 mg of hydrocortisone is given intravenously every eight hours perioperatively, and the dose is slowly reduced (but not the frequency) until the patient can be switched to his or her regular doses of oral medications.</p><p/><p>For convenience, we administer intermittent, rather than continuous, parenteral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a>.</p><p>The maintenance immunosuppressive agents that the patient is receiving are continued in the perioperative period; dose modification is usually unnecessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, chronically immunosuppressed transplant patients may be considered at higher risk to develop infectious complications after surgical, endoscopic, or dental procedures. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis, either with a first-generation cephalosporin or, in the case of dental procedures, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, is ordinarily sufficient in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/issues-relating-to-the-renal-allograft-recipient-undergoing-non-transplant-surgery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients who receive prophylactic antibiotics within a two-hour &quot;window&quot; period before the initial incision have lower rates of surgical-site infection than patients who receive them either too early or postoperatively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Two macrolides, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a>, should be avoided in patients being administered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> as these antibiotics antagonize the CYP 3A4 enzyme system, leading to elevated levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus. Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> is also a macrolide, it does not significantly affect this enzyme system, and its use usually does not alter cyclosporine or tacrolimus levels. Other safe alternatives are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>, which also do not significantly affect cyclosporine or tacrolimus levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Tissue integrity and wound healing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronically immunosuppressed patients, even those on low doses of corticosteroids, may frequently be noted intraoperatively to have &quot;weak&quot; tissues. Although gentle handling of tissues is an old and well-accepted surgical principle, it is particularly important in the technical performance of surgical procedures in transplant patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-abdominal-surgical-incisions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of abdominal surgical incisions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Wound healing is generally slower in immunosuppressed patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/issues-relating-to-the-renal-allograft-recipient-undergoing-non-transplant-surgery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As an example, when skin staples are utilized, they may need to be kept in up to three times longer than in non-transplant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/issues-relating-to-the-renal-allograft-recipient-undergoing-non-transplant-surgery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>A related issue is whether specific immunosuppressive agents may enhance wound-healing complications, even during the period immediately posttransplantation. Some evidence suggests that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> may lead to a higher incidence of adverse outcomes in this setting. In a study of 59 and 64 renal transplant recipients receiving a tacrolimus- or sirolimus-based immunosuppressive regimen, respectively (plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil and corticosteroids in both groups), the incidence of allograft wound complications was significantly higher in the sirolimus group (47 versus 8 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/issues-relating-to-the-renal-allograft-recipient-undergoing-non-transplant-surgery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Perigraft fluid collections, superficial wound infections, and incisional hernias were reported. A discussion of the details concerning adverse cutaneous effects with this agent can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-mammalian-mechanistic-target-of-rapamycin-mtor-inhibitors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of mammalian (mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC SURGICAL PROBLEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following illustrates a few specific clinical considerations that may be particularly important in the transplant recipient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal surgical emergencies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Signs and symptoms of acute abdominal pathology may be masked in transplant patients owing to the administration of chronic immunosuppressive therapy. Although this certainly can occur, a surprising number of patients present in fairly typical and characteristic ways, thereby making the diagnosis relatively straightforward.</p><p>Nevertheless, when such complications occur, the morbidity and mortality may be significant. In one retrospective survey of 416 patients following renal transplantation, 31 experienced major gastrointestinal complications, including 14, 5, and 2 cases of bowel perforations, acute pancreatitis, and acute appendicitis, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/issues-relating-to-the-renal-allograft-recipient-undergoing-non-transplant-surgery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The mortality rate was 30 percent, which was principally attributed to immunosuppression and sepsis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute appendicitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of acute appendicitis may be particularly difficult in a renal (or pancreatic) transplant patient in whom the transplanted organ is found in the right lower quadrant. The appendix is generally displaced superiorly by the transplanted organ; thus, the symptoms and signs are uncharacteristic. The appendix is frequently perforated by the time the diagnosis is made. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and differential diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac surgery can affect a kidney (or pancreas) transplant recipient in the following ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perfusion of the allograft may be compromised with cardiopulmonary bypass. The kidney (or pancreas) may sustain an ischemic insult, which may range from a minimal, reversible rise in the serum creatinine concentration to complete shutdown of the organ. Although the latter is unusual, patients with impaired renal function are more likely to sustain damage to the kidney than those with normal renal function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the unstable cardiac surgical patient who requires an intra-aortic balloon pump, placement of the pump on the side of the renal allograft will result in arterial thrombosis. Although it seems to be so obvious a point as not to require comment, this complication can occur and has occurred; thus, avoiding the groin on the side of the kidney is critically important.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal aortic aneurysm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) routinely requires cross-clamping of the abdominal aorta; this allows the vascular prosthesis to be anastomosed to the proximal and distal aorta (or iliac or femoral arteries). To avoid interruption of the arterial blood supply to the transplanted kidney, temporary bypass may be required, usually from the ipsilateral axillary artery to the femoral artery. This will allow precise, unhurried repair of the aneurysm and eliminate the risk of allograft thrombosis. However, some vascular surgeons believe that there is enough collateral flow to allow AAA repair without a temporary shunt. In addition, a temporary shunt may become completely unnecessary with the advent of endovascular AAA repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/issues-relating-to-the-renal-allograft-recipient-undergoing-non-transplant-surgery/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29690027\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increasing number of recipients require medical care not specifically related to their transplanted organ.
