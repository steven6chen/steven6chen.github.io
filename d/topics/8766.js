Delay in diagnosis may result in acute metabolic decompensation, progressive neurologic injury, or death.</p><p>This topic provides an overview of the evaluation for children with suspected IEM. Confirmation of diagnosis of specific disorders typically requires specialized testing and should be undertaken in consultation with a specialist in genetics or metabolic diseases. The classification, most common presentations, and initial evaluation and management of IEM, particularly those that present as metabolic emergencies, are discussed separately, as are individual disorders.

Newborn screening programs screen all newborns for a specific set of IEM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inborn-errors-of-metabolism-identifying-the-specific-disorder/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The testing methods and disorders that are screened vary from state to state and country to country. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Newborn screening programs increase the detection of IEM but cannot be relied upon exclusively. False-positive and false-negative screening tests occur, usually as a result of screening too early (ie, before adequate &quot;challenge&quot; with protein or carbohydrate), medications, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inborn-errors-of-metabolism-identifying-the-specific-disorder/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In addition, the results of the screening tests may not be available in the first few days of life, when some IEM may present. Furthermore, newborn screening programs do not screen for all IEM. As an example, the urea cycle disorders ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and carbamoylphosphate synthetase deficiency are not detected by available newborn screening methods. Improved detection depends upon a high index of suspicion. Guidelines for evaluation following an abnormal newborn screen can be found in <a href=\"https://www.acmg.net/ACMG/Terms_and_Conditions/ACMG/Terms_and_Conditions.aspx?redirect=https://www.acmg.net/ACMG/Resources/ACT_Sheets_and_Confirmatory_Algorithms/ACMG/Resources/ACT_Sheets_and_Confirmatory_Algorithms/ACT_sheets_Homepage.aspx?hkey=1654e248-53f2-41a9-8d93-f3d96de05e0a&amp;token=suXrenX8oriFxxSFtL9PyVJY2g1a55epNPxe6khZEiWNEKIRw14dTZZc5rx2uyiwBhrtFdkL46NVFivykJNafzfTQ4fBt/xqM5GWOf4rojnjGYpSYYwX4LFeNdhwmm/eiB9gctiHV8wcceDwh4HR5+WdsT2SM+vd3nNU0/ba5vy89Fw0dGqVbfAASAftvLCsGagBCeEfMlPs7x2m85CfOg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=17216\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ACTion (ACT) sheets from the American College of Medical Genetics</a>.

Delay in diagnosis may result in acute metabolic decompensation, progressive neurologic injury, or death. (See <a href=\"#H5818513\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although newborn screening programs increase the detection of IEM, they cannot be relied upon exclusively. Improved detection depends upon a high index of suspicion. (See <a href=\"#H2926302\" class=\"local\">'Newborn screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The history in a patient with IEM should focus on previous episodes of metabolic decompensation, identification of potential triggering events, and family history of metabolic disease or members with similar presentations. (See <a href=\"#H12033756\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The examination is often normal but may provide clues to specific disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51536\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51536 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12033797\" class=\"local\">'Examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory evaluation for IEM should be undertaken in all patients with suggestive history, examination, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abnormalities of routine laboratory tests. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inborn-errors-of-metabolism-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inborn errors of metabolism: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inborn-errors-of-metabolism-metabolic-emergencies#H16728975\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inborn errors of metabolism: Metabolic emergencies&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inborn-errors-of-metabolism-metabolic-emergencies#H3681940\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inborn errors of metabolism: Metabolic emergencies&quot;, section on 'Laboratory findings'</a> and <a href=\"#H12033749\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12033830\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing should be performed at the time of presentation or when symptoms are most pronounced. Patients with life-threatening illness should undergo concurrent evaluation for other conditions in the differential diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H12033830\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inborn-errors-of-metabolism-metabolic-emergencies#H363620\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inborn errors of metabolism: Metabolic emergencies&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest a stepwise approach to the laboratory evaluation, beginning with basic tests that are routinely available, before obtaining specialized metabolic investigations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67745\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67745 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76373 \">table 6</a>). Decisions regarding specialized testing are best undertaken in consultation with a specialist in genetics or metabolic disorders and laboratory personnel to make sure that specimens are obtained, processed, and analyzed appropriately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inborn-errors-of-metabolism-metabolic-emergencies#H366024\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inborn errors of metabolism: Metabolic emergencies&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"#H12033857\" class=\"local\">'Specialized tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic approach to the child with suspected IEM depends upon the clinical presentation. When the clinical presentation suggests a particular disorder, the evaluation can be streamlined. When the clinical presentation is associated with certain groups of disorders, additional testing is needed to narrow the differential diagnosis. Additional evaluation for developmental delay or regression, hepatomegaly, cardiomyopathy, and skeletal myopathy are discussed above. Critical presentations are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H2368162\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of specific presentations'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inborn-errors-of-metabolism-metabolic-emergencies#H669988\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inborn errors of metabolism: Metabolic emergencies&quot;, section on 'Evaluation of specific critical presentations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postmortem evaluation of children with suspected, but undiagnosed, IEM at the time of death is essential to determine the cause of death and to permit subsequent genetic counseling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prenatal diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H25935279\" class=\"local\">'Postmortem'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inborn-errors-of-metabolism-identifying-the-specific-disorder/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Champion MP.
