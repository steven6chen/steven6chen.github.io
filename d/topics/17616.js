Treatment consists of a combined modality approach that includes surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy in most patients. Long-term survival is now achieved in approximately three-quarters of patients, but each component of therapy can cause delayed complications that have a profound effect on quality of life in survivors. Clinical trials and future research efforts are focused on attempts to decrease treatment toxicity while maintaining high cure rates in patients with medulloblastoma.</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of medulloblastoma in children and adults, as well as the delayed complications of therapy, are discussed here. The clinical presentation, diagnosis, risk stratification, histopathology, and molecular pathogenesis of medulloblastoma are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-risk-stratification-of-medulloblastoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and risk stratification of medulloblastoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histopathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-medulloblastoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Histopathology and molecular pathogenesis of medulloblastoma&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3177271\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal initial treatment of patients with medulloblastoma includes both general measures to alleviate increased intracranial pressure and specific therapy directed against the tumor. Based upon results from multiple cooperative group trials, preferred approach includes a combination of maximal safe surgical resection, radiation therapy (RT) to both the tumor site and the craniospinal axis, and systemic chemotherapy. The application of this combined modality approach to different risk groups is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H3177320\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3177278\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased intracranial pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with medulloblastoma often present with increased intracranial pressure due to obstructive hydrocephalus from compression of the fourth ventricle by the expanding tumor. Placement of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt to relieve hydrocephalus is usually deferred until surgical resection, since surgery alone is often sufficient to treat this problem.</p><p>Local swelling from the tumor can contribute to symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. This vasogenic tumor edema is typically relieved by treatment with corticosteroids. The management of increased intracranial pressure is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-elevated-intracranial-pressure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of elevated intracranial pressure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3177285\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maximal safe resection is a key component of the treatment of all patients with medulloblastoma. Resection confirms the diagnosis, relieves increased intracranial pressure, and helps establish local control. Surgery is used to remove as much of the tumor as possible without causing serious neurologic sequelae (eg, persistent ataxia, cranial nerve deficits).</p><p>With modern surgical techniques and imaging guidance in the operating room, gross total or near total resection is achieved in a majority of patients. Because of the potential for neurologic complications, however, total or radical resection is not always possible, and overly aggressive attempts to achieve complete resection should be avoided.</p><p>Whether gross total resection confers improved survival over near-total resection has not been tested in a randomized trial. Observational data, mostly in the era before institution of combined craniospinal radiation and multiagent chemotherapy, have suggested that extent of resection is a key prognostic factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. However, the magnitude of this effect may be lower than previously thought, particularly when molecular subtype is taken into account [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Surgical resection of tumors in the midline cerebellum can be associated with posterior fossa syndrome, also called cerebellar mutism, which occurs in approximately one quarter of patients undergoing resection of a medulloblastoma. (See <a href=\"#H3177369\" class=\"local\">'Posterior fossa syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3177292\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation therapy (RT) is an integral component of the initial management of patients with medulloblastoma, both to control residual posterior fossa disease and to treat any disease that has spread along the craniospinal axis. However, toxicity to the brain and spinal cord limits the doses used. This is particularly true in very young children, for whom craniospinal radiation is avoided or delayed due to severe toxicity to the rapidly developing central nervous system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3177299\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After surgical excision, medulloblastomas are treated with external beam RT to the craniospinal axis, with an additional boost to the tumor site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/4,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,8</a>]. Contemporary radiation doses vary according to risk group. (See <a href=\"#H2952365\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification'</a> below.)</p><p>For average risk disease, the whole brain and spine are typically treated with 23.4 Gy, with posterior fossa boost of 30.6 Gy to total dose of 54 Gy. For advanced-stage disease, 36 Gy is administered to the whole brain and spine, with a posterior fossa boost of 18 Gy to a total dose of 54 Gy. </p><p>The rationale for additional radiation to the tumor bed is based upon the observation that 50 to 70 percent of recurrences occur in the posterior fossa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Although some investigators include the entire posterior fossa in the boost volume, current protocols are investigating the use of reduced posterior fossa high dose volume boost in order to spare normal brain from excess radiation exposure. Posterior fossa failures are primarily in the tumor bed and are often associated with leptomeningeal failure. Local failure in the posterior fossa outside the tumor bed is rare as the solitary site of failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. </p><p>Using conventional techniques, the brain and spine are treated with separate but abutting RT fields. Placement of the junction between these two fields must be done precisely. Adjusting the site where these two fields abut each other two or three times during the course of craniospinal irradiation is routinely done to minimize the potential of overlapping dose to the spinal cord. However, sparing the spinal cord increases the dose to the thyroid gland, mandible, pharynx, and larynx. In developing children, this may increase the risk of late hypothyroidism or mandibular hypoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Newer techniques, such as proton radiation therapy and intensity modulated RT (IMRT), are recommended to limit radiation to normal tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. While whole brain radiation with protons is no safer than with photons, use of protons or IMRT planning for posterior fossa boost and spine RT avoids or minimizes radiation to the medial temporal lobes, inner ear, thyroid gland, lungs, heart, and abdominal organs compared with older techniques, without sacrificing disease control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/12,13,15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,15-19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3177306\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although higher doses of RT are associated with better tumor control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/4,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,20</a>], irradiation of the craniospinal axis in children is associated with a significant incidence of neurologic complications, including neurocognitive impairment. Whenever possible, RT is delayed for children younger than three years of age to permit further development of the central nervous system. (See <a href=\"#H3177376\" class=\"local\">'Neurocognitive impairment'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to its effects on neurocognitive development, craniospinal RT can cause decreased skeletal growth, hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and hypogonadism, all of which may be minimized with lower doses of radiation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> newer techniques. (See <a href=\"#H3177362\" class=\"local\">'Complications of treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Because of the risks of serious complications, the initial management of pediatric patients with medulloblastoma has utilized adjuvant chemotherapy with decreased doses of RT in average-risk children or substituted chemotherapy for RT in the initial management of infants and young children. (See <a href=\"#H3177327\" class=\"local\">'Average-risk disease in children older than 3 years'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3177341\" class=\"local\">'Infants and young children'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3177313\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemotherapy has an important role in the multimodality management of children with medulloblastoma in several settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In average-risk children, adjuvant chemotherapy is used following surgery and radiation therapy (RT) to decrease the incidence of recurrence and minimize craniospinal radiation exposure.

(See <a href=\"#H3177341\" class=\"local\">'Infants and young children'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy is used with RT to treat high-risk disease that is not amenable to surgical resection.

Prior to use of radiation, no children survived with surgical resection alone as therapy. Radiation therapy was incorporated to reduce the rate of local recurrence in the surgical bed and along the craniospinal axis (see <a href=\"#H3177292\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above).</p><p>Subsequent multicenter randomized trials integrated chemotherapy along with radiation therapy following surgical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/8,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,21-24</a>]. Although randomized trials did not demonstrate a statistically significant benefit to overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], subset analyses suggested that chemotherapy did improve survival in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/8,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,21,22</a>], and its use has been widely adopted, in large part to enable use of lower doses of radiation. </p><p>Often there is no better therapy to offer a patient than enrollment onto a well-designed, scientifically valid, peer-reviewed clinical trial. Additional information and instructions for referring a patient to an appropriate research center can be obtained from the United States National Institutes of Health (<a href=\"http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/&amp;token=NK91I08KOJ1eJ1hT1o/oHgJu4vbbEBRl2V0d48fIIMDpbZTpeZvuNaOE2M5VxYDS&amp;TOPIC_ID=88801\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.clinicaltrials.gov</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2952365\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk stratification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The current approach to the treatment of children with medulloblastoma varies according to two main factors: risk for recurrence, which depends primarily on extent of disease; and risk for treatment toxicity, with children younger than the age of three being at particularly high risk for neurologic impairment from radiation therapy. Using these factors, patients are divided into the following treatment groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children &ge;3 years of age with average-risk disease, defined as total or near-total resection at the time of surgery and no evidence of disseminated disease by brain and spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis (see <a href=\"#H3177327\" class=\"local\">'Average-risk disease in children older than 3 years'</a> below) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children &ge;3 years of age with high-risk disease, defined as the presence of &ge;1.5 cm<sup>2</sup> of residual tumor after surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> evidence of disseminated or metastatic disease (see <a href=\"#H3177334\" class=\"local\">'High-risk disease in children older than 3 years'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants and children younger than three years of age (see <a href=\"#H3177341\" class=\"local\">'Infants and young children'</a> below)</p><p/><p>In addition to these factors, there is an increasing understanding that medulloblastomas are genetically heterogeneous and can be divided into at least four molecular subgroups, each with divergent genetics, clinical behavior, prognosis, and potentially therapeutic targets (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F109467\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109467 \">table 1</a>). These subgroups are being integrated into clinical trial design and will likely form the basis for improved risk stratification and individualized therapy in the future. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histopathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-medulloblastoma#H4480322\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Histopathology and molecular pathogenesis of medulloblastoma&quot;, section on 'Molecular subgroups'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3177327\"><span class=\"h3\">Average-risk disease in children older than 3 years</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The current approach to children age &ge;3 years with medulloblastoma that is amenable to total or near-total resection includes surgery, followed by craniospinal irradiation (RT), and then adjuvant chemotherapy. </p><p>The results of this approach in this patient subset are illustrated by the Children's Oncology Group (COG) study, first published in 2006 and updated in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>]. This phase III trial included 421 children who had undergone complete or nearly complete surgical resection (residual disease &lt;1.5 cm<sup>2</sup> on postoperative imaging). Patients were required to have no evidence of disseminated disease on MRI and a negative cytologic examination of cerebrospinal fluid.</p><p>Following surgery, children were treated with 23.4 Gy of craniospinal RT, followed by a posterior fossa boost of 32.4 Gy, for a total RT dose of 55.8 Gy to the tumor bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Children received weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a> during RT. After completion of RT, patients were randomly assigned to eight cycles of chemotherapy with one of two regimens (vincristine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>, plus CCNU, or vincristine and cisplatin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>).</p><p>For the entire cohort of 379 evaluable children, the 10-year event-free and overall survival rates were 76 and 81 percent at a median follow-up of 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. There were no significant differences between the two chemotherapy regimens in terms of efficacy; infectious complications were higher in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> arm and electrolyte abnormalities were more common in the CCNU arm. </p><p>The event-free survival in average-risk patients in this trial incorporating adjuvant chemotherapy is superior to that previously seen in trials using RT alone, even when a higher dose of RT is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/8,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,20</a>]. The results are also at least as good as those seen in trials using more intensive chemotherapy regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/23,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,27</a>].</p><p>Toxicity associated with treatment in these children included the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Virtually all patients experienced acute grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity during treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ototoxicity was seen in approximately 25 percent of patients. In a secondary analysis, cumulative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> dose was not associated with event-free or overall survival, suggesting that lower doses of cisplatin can likely be used to help reduce ototoxicity without affecting survival outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 25 percent of patients had significant neurologic sequelae from their surgery and RT, which persisted at one year in about one-half [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cumulative 10-year incidence rate of second malignancies was 4.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Based upon results from other studies using this dose level of RT, significant neurocognitive impairment is expected to be seen, particularly in younger children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detailed evaluation of endocrine outcomes has not been reported, but a significant frequency of such abnormalities is anticipated. </p><p/><p>Because of the neurologic toxicity associated with this dose of RT in other studies, the ongoing medulloblastoma trial of the COG is randomly assigning children age three to seven years old to craniospinal RT at a dose of either 18 or 23.4 Gy; older children continue to receive 23.4 Gy. All patients are then independently randomized to receive whole posterior fossa boost RT versus a more limited volume defined by the tumor bed boost. All patients have the boost volume brought to a total dose of 54 Gy. Deferral of radiation is associated with worse overall survival and is not recommended in children older than three years of age outside of the context of a clinical trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3177334\"><span class=\"h3\">High-risk disease in children older than 3 years</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal treatment for children with metastatic or unresectable medulloblastoma is unknown, and there is an increased risk for recurrence and death even with treatment that includes by radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy.</p><p>A reasonable approach in this patient group is illustrated by a COG study in which 161 children &ge;3 years of age with high-risk medulloblastoma were treated with postoperative craniospinal RT with concurrent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, followed by six maintenance cycles of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and vincristine with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The five-year progression-free and overall survival rates for patients treated with the cisplatin-containing regimen were 59 and 68 percent; for those not treated with cisplatin, progression-free and overall survival rates were similar (71 and 82 percent). There were no treatment-related deaths, and the rate of second malignancies was 2.5 percent after eight years of follow-up. Other single-arm studies have reported similar outcomes with other multiagent regimens plus craniospinal RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p>High-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) following RT has been explored in this group of patients. In a prospective study that included 48 patients with high-risk disease treated with craniospinal RT (36 to 39.6 Gy) followed by four cycles of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous HCT, the five-year event-free survival rate was 70 percent with no treatment-related mortalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A subsequent prospective study using a more intensive chemotherapy regimen but with reduced-dose craniospinal RT (23.4 to 30.6 Gy) reported five-year event-free and overall survival rates of 70 and 74 percent and a treatment-related mortality rate of 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Larger studies and long term follow up are needed to determine whether the additional short- and long-term risks of high-dose chemotherapy regimens outweigh the potential benefits in this patient population.</p><p>Another treatment modification being explored in patients with high-risk disease is hyperfractionated accelerated RT, which in at least two prospective studies appears to be feasible when combined with multidrug chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-medulloblastoma/abstract/33,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3177341\"><span class=\"h3\">Infants and young children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children younger than three years of age with medulloblastoma are at high risk of severe neurologic impairment if their initial treatment includes craniospinal radiation therapy (RT).

However, the added value of chemotherapy in average-risk adults is less clear than in children, both because the toxicity of chemotherapy is considerably higher in adults and because there is less urgency to reduce the total radiation dose in the mature versus developing nervous system. Treatment decisions in adults must therefore be individualized, balancing the potential yet unproven benefits of chemotherapy on long-term survival against the risks of toxicity, which are likely to be higher in older patients and those with poor performance status or multiple medical comorbidities. </p><p>Like children, adults are typically stratified into risk groups based on the extent of surgical resection and the presence or absence of disseminated or metastatic disease.

Patients should be treated in clinical trials whenever possible. Following maximum safe resection, our approach to the treatment of children with medulloblastoma varies according to the extent of disease and the age at diagnosis: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Average-risk disease &ndash; The average-risk subset includes children &ge;3 years of age who have undergone a complete or near complete resection, have a negative cerebrospinal fluid cytology, and have no evidence of distant metastases. If these children cannot be included in a formal clinical trial, we recommend combined modality treatment including both craniospinal RT and adjuvant combination chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3177327\" class=\"local\">'Average-risk disease in children older than 3 years'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The protocol used in the Children's Oncology Group medulloblastoma trial is the current standard. After gross total resection of the tumor, patients are treated with 23.4 Gy to the craniospinal axis with a posterior fossa boost to a total dose of 55.8 Gy, with weekly concurrent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>. This is followed by eight cycles of chemotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>, vincristine, and either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or CCNU. (See <a href=\"#H3177327\" class=\"local\">'Average-risk disease in children older than 3 years'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-risk disease &ndash; The optimal treatment for children with metastatic, unresectable, or recurrent medulloblastoma is unknown; these patients should be included on a clinical protocol whenever possible. In the absence of a suitable clinical study, we suggest craniospinal RT with concurrent chemotherapy followed by combination chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3177334\" class=\"local\">'High-risk disease in children older than 3 years'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants and young children &ndash; Children &lt;3 years of age with medulloblastoma are at high risk of severe neurologic impairment if their initial treatment includes craniospinal RT. We recommend that treatment in this age group follow protocols that utilize combination chemotherapy to either delay or obviate the need for craniospinal RT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3177341\" class=\"local\">'Infants and young children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults &ndash; The clinical experience with medulloblastoma in adults is more limited, and treatment should be patterned after that in children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If adults with average-risk disease cannot be included in a formal clinical trial, we suggest combined modality treatment including both craniospinal RT and adjuvant combination chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with poor performance status or multiple comorbidities, an alternative is craniospinal RT. (See <a href=\"#H3177348\" class=\"local\">'Adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The optimal treatment for adults with metastatic, unresectable, or recurrent medulloblastoma is unknown. These patients should be included on a clinical protocol whenever possible. In the absence of a suitable clinical study, we suggest craniospinal RT followed by combination chemotherapy rather than RT alone in most patients. (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3177348\" class=\"local\">'Adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each component of treatment can cause delayed complications that have a profound effect on quality of life in medulloblastoma survivors. The most common long-term complications of therapy include neurocognitive impairment, hearing loss, endocrine abnormalities, cerebrovascular disease, and second malignancies.
