Prior to that time, testicular cancer accounted for 11 percent of cancer deaths in men between the ages of 25 and 34, and the five-year survival rate was 64 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-tumor-markers-in-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Currently, the five-year survival rate is over 95 percent, largely due to a better understanding of the natural history of testicular tumors, improved staging and surgical techniques, the use of effective platinum-based combination chemotherapy, and the availability of highly sensitive serum tumor markers to detect minimal residual disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Three serum tumor markers have established roles in the management of men with testicular GCTs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alpha fetoprotein (AFP)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)</p><p/><p>Serum concentrations of AFP <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> beta-hCG are elevated in 80 to 85 percent of men with nonseminomatous GCTs. By contrast, serum beta-hCG is elevated in fewer than 25 percent of seminomas, and AFP is not elevated in pure seminomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81626\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81626 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Although these markers can provide supportive evidence for the initial diagnosis of a testicular cancer and are useful for prognosis and risk stratification, their main utility is for monitoring response to treatment and detecting recurrence. The role of these serum tumor markers in the management of men with testicular GCTs will be reviewed here. The integration of serum tumor markers into the overall follow-up plan for patients who have completed their initial treatment for a GCT is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posttreatment-follow-up-for-men-with-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posttreatment follow-up for men with testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HUMAN CHORIONIC GONADOTROPIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs) produce the intact human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) molecule. However, serum assays measure the beta subunit since the alpha subunit is common to several pituitary hormones. Beta-hCG is the most commonly elevated tumor marker in testicular cancer. The normal value in men is less than 5 to 10 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span>.</p><p>The production of hCG by testicular nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs) varies depending upon the tumor burden and the histologic subtypes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonseminomatous germ cell tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum levels of beta-hCG are elevated in 10 to 20 percent of clinical stage I NSGCTs and up to 40 percent of those with advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-tumor-markers-in-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

An increase in serum beta-hCG primarily reflects higher tumor burden, but not necessarily a greater metastatic potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-tumor-markers-in-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, an elevated serum beta-hCG that returns to normal after orchiectomy in a patient with stage I seminoma does not indicate advanced disease.

Serum tumor markers should not be used to screen asymptomatic men for testicular tumors. The literature supporting the utilization of serum tumor markers for these indications has been reviewed in guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-tumor-markers-in-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum levels of beta-hCG and AFP should be measured prior to orchiectomy to help establish the diagnosis and to provide guidance for postorchiectomy management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-tumor-markers-in-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The majority of men with a suspected testicular GCT undergo orchiectomy for both histologic confirmation and local tumor control. <strong>Postorchiectomy</strong> levels of tumor markers are used in risk stratification.</p><p>Generally, neither serum beta-hCG nor AFP should be used alone to establish the diagnosis of testicular cancer in the absence of histologic confirmation. However, markedly elevated serum tumor markers can be used to support a presumptive diagnosis of GCT if initial orchiectomy or metastatic biopsy is not feasible because of an urgent need to initiate treatment. Serum tumor markers may also be used to support the diagnosis of GCT if biopsy of a metastatic site reveals a poorly differentiated carcinoma without characteristic histopathologic features.
