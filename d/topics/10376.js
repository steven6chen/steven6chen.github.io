Leakage of chyle from abnormal lymphatic masses and lymphatic malformations and flow of chylous ascites into the pleural space can also cause chylothorax. The fluid typically has a high triglyceride content and often a turbid or milky white appearance. In contrast, a cholesterol pleural effusion, which can also have a milky appearance, has a high concentration of cholesterol and lecithin-globulin complexes that accumulate due to pleural inflammation or infection.</p><p>A pleural fluid triglyceride concentration greater than 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.24 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> strongly supports the diagnosis of a chylothorax, but triglyceride concentrations may be less than 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in 15 percent of patients and less than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A pleural fluid triglyceride concentration less than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> provides strong support that the patient does not have a chylothorax. If the triglyceride level is less than 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (less than 1.24 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> but the diagnosis is suspected clinically, the presence of chylomicrons in the pleural fluid by lipoprotein electrophoresis can confirm the presence of a chylothorax.</p><p>The therapeutic options and an approach to managing chylothorax will be reviewed here. The etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of chylothorax, the evaluation and management of cholesterol effusions, and general issues regarding the evaluation and treatment of pleural effusions are discussed separately.

More recently, modalities such as <span class=\"nowrap\">somatostatin/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a>,</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>, pleurovenous or pleuroperitoneal shunting, therapeutic lymphangiography, and thoracic duct embolization or disruption have assumed roles in management. It is critical to exclude chylous ascites as the cause of chylothorax because the transdiaphragmatic migration of ascites may not respond to interventions directed toward altering lymph flow in the thoracic duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Staged approaches for using the various options based on the etiology of the chylothorax are discussed in the following sections. (See <a href=\"#H1067428\" class=\"local\">'Management approach'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1067371\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of the underlying condition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients with chylothorax due to nontraumatic causes, such as infection, sarcoidosis, lymphoma, or metastatic carcinoma, treatment of the underlying condition is an important component of therapy, either alone or combined with other modalities depending on the severity of chyle leakage and rapidity of response to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1067435\" class=\"local\">'Nontraumatic chylothorax'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1067379\"><span class=\"h2\">Pleural drainage to control symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intermittent therapeutic thoracentesis or use of an indwelling catheter for home drainage is typically used in the initial management of nontraumatic and nonsurgical traumatic effusions to relieve dyspnea caused by the pleural fluid. These techniques are usually employed in outpatients who have a gradual reaccumulation of pleural fluid and will often control respiratory symptoms over the short-term while waiting for the chyle leak to resolve with conservative therapy.</p><p>A chest tube without suction may be placed in patients with a postsurgical chylothorax or in those with chylothoraces that rapidly reaccumulate after thoracentesis. However, long-term, continuous chest tube drainage is associated with immunosuppression and a resultant increased risk of infections, as well as electrolyte and nutritional losses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. As an example, when thoracic duct drainage was used in the past to deplete lymphocytes and prepare patients for organ transplantation, 14 days of chylous drainage results in a clinically important degree of immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Lymph fluid and the lymphatic vessels in general interact in complex ways to preserve host immune defenses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Thus, continuous pleural fluid drainage by chest tube is generally limited to less than 14 days to minimize the risk of infection and malnutrition. Surgical intervention is generally indicated sooner (eg, within five days), if the drainage of pleural fluid exceeds 1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">liter/day,</span> or if the drainage of chyle results in weight loss and progressive hypoproteinemia despite aggressive nutritional therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>All patients managed with continuous drainage of chylous pleural fluid require monitoring of serum electrolytes, lymphocyte counts, albumin, total protein, and weight. Depending on the drainage rate, patients may require blood tests two to three times a week until they maintain stable values. Patients who undergo continuous drainage with restricted oral diets require careful attention to nutritional needs with provision of enteral or parenteral nutrients designed to offset the protein and calorie losses related to drainage of the chylothorax. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-support-in-advanced-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional support in advanced lung disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1067386\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decreasing fat in oral or enteral feedings decreases the flow of chyle to a trickle and allows an opportunity for spontaneous closure of a lymphatic leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Dietary exclusion of long-chain triglycerols (LCTs) is encouraged; this avoids their conversion into monoglycerides and free fatty acids (FFA), which are transported as chylomicrons to the intestinal lymph ducts. </p><p>Initially, patients should receive a fat-free diet (&lt;5 kcal of fat per meal) for a short period but it is often unpalatable and difficult to maintain long-term. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clear liquids are usually tolerated without affecting chyle drainage into the pleural space and may be progressed to carbohydrate and protein-rich feedings. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral vitamins should be provided although decreased absorption of fat-soluble vitamins with low-fat diets may require parenteral supplementation of these micronutrients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous (IV) fat emulsions (250 mL of 20 percent emulsion IV three times a week) can prevent essential fatty acid deficiency while on a fat-free diet. </p><p/><p>Depending on clinical response, medium chain triglycerols (MCTs) can be provided orally as a liquid or capsule or in the form of enteral feeding products, which may not be tolerated because of taste. The latter can be supplemented by enteral feedings. MCTs are absorbed directly into intestinal cells and transported directly to the liver via the portal vein, thus bypassing the thoracic duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. Common adverse effects are gastrointestinal upset, steatorrhea, and elevated cholesterol blood levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chylous-bloody-and-pancreatic-ascites#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chylous, bloody, and pancreatic ascites&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p>An oral diet is always preferred to an enteral diet when possible. Enteral nutrition may be prescribed as a supplement to oral nutrition or as the sole source of nutrition for patients who can take nothing by mouth. Controversy exists regarding the timing of parenteral nutrition for patients with postoperative chylothorax with recommendations for use only for patients who fail all other options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>As patients improve with decreased pleural fluid drainage, LCTs are added to the diet with progression to an unrestricted diet as tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1067400\"><span class=\"h2\">Pleurodesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemical pleurodesis is often performed in patients with nontraumatic chylothorax whose chylothorax has not responded to thoracentesis and dietary control measures. Options include talc instillation by a chest drainage catheter, talc insufflation during video-assisted thoracoscopy, other forms of chemical pleurodesis, and mechanical pleurodesis at the time of thoracoscopy or thoracotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. The details of chemical pleurodesis and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talc-sterile-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">talc pleurodesis</a> are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemical-pleurodesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemical pleurodesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talc-pleurodesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Talc pleurodesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The success of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talc-sterile-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">talc pleurodesis</a> generally depends on adequate drainage of the pleural space prior to instillation or insufflation of talc. Therefore, high output chylothoraces may require concomitant thoracic duct ligation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20</a>]. It is difficult to determine the relative success of pleurodesis alone compared with pleurodesis plus thoracic duct ligation because the available data are limited to case series, which may be biased (eg, the rate of chyle output may have influenced the choice of procedure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Nonetheless, in the setting of nonsurgical chylothorax, series of patients who underwent pleurodesis alone generally revealed a success rate between 80 and 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/18,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20-22</a>]. In the setting of postsurgical chylothorax, thoracic duct ligation is generally considered the treatment of choice, and therefore, minimal data are available regarding pleurodesis without thoracic duct ligation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. One series of 37 patients with chylothorax after thoracotomy resection for primary lung cancer noted that chylothoraces resolved in 23 patients after treatment with a low fat diet. Eight of 10 patients with persistent chylothoraces and pleural fluid output of 300 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> responded to pleurodesis with OK-432 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients with &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> of pleural fluid output responded to surgical interventions. (See <a href=\"#H1067463\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative (surgical) chylothorax'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1067407\"><span class=\"h2\">Thoracic duct ligation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients who require thoracic duct ligation have a high volume chylothorax, which most commonly arises as a complication of a surgical procedure such as esophagectomy cervical procedures, or lung resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/22,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24-26</a>]. Thoracic duct ligation is performed via video-assisted thoracoscopy or open thoracotomy depending on local expertise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/27-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-33</a>]. For patients with postsurgical chylothorax, some surgeons prefer an open approach (eg, thoracotomy) for greater visibility, although the need for thoracotomy is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/16,27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,27-30</a>]. Preoperative visualization by various lymphangiography imaging techniques is critically important to determine the source of chyle leakage to determine the potential benefits of thoracic duct ligation.</p><p>Access to the thoracic duct is usually via the side with the chylothorax because that side is typically the location of the thoracic duct tear. In addition, accessing the side with the chylothorax allows mechanical or chemical pleurodesis to be performed on that side during the operation. However, other considerations regarding the surgical approach may influence the choice of which side to enter, such as the exact course of the thoracic duct in that patient, the side of the initial surgery or the ease or difficulty of a left-sided approach in patients who have a gastric conduit following esophagectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-spontaneous-pneumothorax-in-adults#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary spontaneous pneumothorax in adults&quot;, section on 'VATS pleurodesis'</a>.)</p><p>To help identify the leakage site, dairy cream or another fat load mixed with a lipophilic green dye may be administered via nasogastric or nasojejunal tube 20 minutes prior to induction of anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Alternatively, because the leakage site is often apparent without this step, the cream or enteral fat load may be administered intraoperatively if needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In some centers, lymphangiography is performed prior to surgery to identify the site of leakage, although the degree to which this procedure improves surgical success is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/20,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,34,35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax#H10472849\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of chylothorax&quot;, section on 'Lymphangiography and lymphoscintigraphy'</a>.)</p><p>Sutures or clips are placed on both sides of an identified tear; when the exact leakage site is unclear during surgery, the duct is usually ligated or clipped just cephalad to the aortic hiatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/16,29,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,29,32</a>]. In addition, a sealant or fibrin glue is sometimes applied to the area of ligation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/16,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,36</a>]. Extensive dissection to identify the site of leakage is discouraged because this may create additional thoracic duct leakage sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Although thoracic duct ligation is generally successful in resolving a chylothorax, it has a morbidity and mortality of 38 and 2.1 percent respectively when performed for postoperative chylothoraces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Lymphedema is a known complication of thoracic duct ligation, but usually resolves over several months as collateral lymphatic-venous communications develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>When the chyle leak is found to be subdiaphragmatic based on thoracoscopic examination or lymphatic imaging, a laparoscopic approach is used to ligate the cisterna chyli (a sac at the caudal or lower end of the thoracic duct into which the intestinal and two lumbar lymphatic trunks drain). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of chylothorax&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6421123\"><span class=\"h2\">Interventional radiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous, image-guided techniques are increasingly used for management of high flow chylothoraces, chylothoraces that fail to respond to conservative therapy, and persistent chylothoraces in patients who are poor operative candidates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Among the multiple procedures performed, thoracic duct embolization or disruption and lymphangiography represent the most commonly discussed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6421438\"><span class=\"h3\">Thoracic duct embolization and disruption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Percutaneous catheterization and embolization or needle disruption of the thoracic duct, cisterna chyli, lymphatic masses, or prominent retroperitoneal lymphatic ducts have been employed in patients with both traumatic and nontraumatic chylothoraces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/39-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-50</a>]. </p><p>Initial lymphangiography with pedal or ultrasound-guided intranodal lymphatic cannulation allows visualization of large retroperitoneal lymphatics, which are then most commonly accessed by transabdominal percutaneous needle cannulation. Some centers access the thoracic duct in a retrograde manner via a subclavian vein approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/47,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,51</a>] or by transnodal lymphangiography via groin nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>] when a transabdominal approach is unsuccessful or unfeasible. Other approaches have been reviewed in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] with one case report demonstrating success with percutaneous thoracic duct sclero-embolization guided by CT-lymphangiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>After cannulation of the cisterna chyli, a catheter is advanced into the thoracic duct with instillation of contrast to localize the leak. The affected thoracic segment is then embolized with coils and surgical &quot;glue&quot; (thoracic duct embolization [TDE]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/40,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,46,47</a>]. If the thoracic duct cannot be cannulated, it can be disrupted by multiple needle passes under fluoroscopic guidance (thoracic duct disruption [TDD]). The procedure is technically challenging with 79 percent of patients experiencing a technically successful procedure on the first attempt and 79 percent of procedures (first and subsequent attempts) being technically successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. For all patients with traumatic and nontraumatic chylothoraces in one series who underwent TDE or TDD when TDE attempts were unsuccessful <span class=\"nowrap\">(TDE/TDD),</span> clinical success rates were 58 percent with higher rates of clinical response for traumatic (62 percent) as compared with nontraumatic (13 percent) chylothoraces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Other series limited to patients with traumatic chylothoraces report a complete or partial success rate with <span class=\"nowrap\">TDE/TDD</span> of 71 percent to 74 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/43,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,46</a>]. Success rates for TDE alone for patients with traumatic chylothorax have been reported as high as 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. For patients with nontraumatic chylothoraces, success of TDE has been reported to be highest (75 percent) when lymphatic obstruction is demonstrated by lymphangiography to be at the level of the thoracic duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p>Immediate post-procedure complications are usually minor and occur in less than 7 percent of patients with leg swelling and chronic diarrhea being the most common delayed complications each occurring in 8 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-chylothorax/abstract/40,44,47,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,44,47,54</a>].

Wider experience is needed with these procedures to determine underlying etiologies of chylothorax and other clinical factors that are associated with clinical responsiveness. As an example, patients with nontraumatic chylothorax and lymphatic masses may have patent thoracic ducts on lymphangiography and not respond to thoracic duct embolization because chylothorax results from over production of lymph, weeping of lymph from diseased lymph nodes into the pleural space, or leakage from malformed or disrupted lymphatic channels within or near the region of the lymphatic masses.

(See <a href=\"#H1067428\" class=\"local\">'Management approach'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of chylothorax&quot;, section on 'Chyle composition'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a nontraumatic chylothorax due to an underlying disease that is amenable to medical therapy (eg, infection, sarcoidosis, lymphoma), we initiate prompt treatment of the underlying disease. (See <a href=\"#H1067435\" class=\"local\">'Nontraumatic chylothorax'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a nontraumatic chylothorax (eg, malignant, idiopathic, sarcoidosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis) is large enough to cause respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea at rest or with minimal exertion), we recommend initial therapeutic pleural drainage rather than more invasive options (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Pleural drainage may be accomplished by therapeutic thoracentesis, tube thoracostomy, or indwelling pleural catheter placement, depending on the rate of accumulation and the anticipated response to therapy. Drainage should be accompanied by dietary modification to reduce chyle flow both to enhance the chance of healing and to reduce loss of lymphocytes and nutrients. (See <a href=\"#H1067379\" class=\"local\">'Pleural drainage to control symptoms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1067435\" class=\"local\">'Nontraumatic chylothorax'</a> above.). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with nontraumatic, nonmalignant chylothorax, we also suggest a trial of dietary control measures (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), which include a high protein-low fat diet, supplemented with medium chain triglycerols (MCT). This is the first therapeutic approach except for patients with a higher rate of accumulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> initial nutritionally depleted states who may require fasting plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>. (See <a href=\"#H1067435\" class=\"local\">'Nontraumatic chylothorax'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1067386\" class=\"local\">'Dietary therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a symptomatic malignant chylothorax that fails to resolve after treatment of the underlying malignancy and accumulates sufficiently rapidly to make intermittent thoracentesis burdensome, we suggest an interventional radiologic intervention, such as lymphatic embolization, or instillation of a pleural sclerosing agent (such as talc) through a chest tube or thoracoscope (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Alternatives would include surgical thoracic duct ligation in addition to pleurodesis, for those who are able to tolerate surgery, or use of an indwelling pleural catheter for intermittent drainage. We commonly initiate an adjunctive trial of somatostatin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1067442\" class=\"local\">'Malignant chylothorax'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-malignant-pleural-effusions#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of malignant pleural effusions&quot;, section on 'Rapid reaccumulation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with an idiopathic or benign nontraumatic chylothorax that is refractory to the combination of treatment of the underlying disease, intermittent pleural drainage, and dietary control measures, we suggest lymphatic embolization or disruption under lymphangiogram guidance or thoracic duct ligation with or without pleurodesis rather than pleurodesis alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Thoracic duct ligation may be combined with pleurodesis, although the additional benefit of pleurodesis in this setting is not known. Alternative choices include chemical pleurodesis and somatostatin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> treatment. (See <a href=\"#H1067435\" class=\"local\">'Nontraumatic chylothorax'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1067400\" class=\"local\">'Pleurodesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1067407\" class=\"local\">'Thoracic duct ligation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the majority of patients with traumatic chylothorax (eg, nonsurgical or postoperative), we suggest initial conservative management rather than surgical intervention (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Conservative management includes chest tube drainage and dietary modifications with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> or a high protein-reduced fat diet with MCT supplementation. Close attention to fluid and electrolyte management, nutrition, and the daily volume of pleural drainage is needed. (See <a href=\"#H1067386\" class=\"local\">'Dietary therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1067379\" class=\"local\">'Pleural drainage to control symptoms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H88586908\" class=\"local\">'Nonsurgical traumatic chylothorax'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a traumatic chylothorax (eg, nonsurgical or postoperative) who fail to respond to chest tube drainage and dietary modifications, pleurodesis may control the chylothorax allowing chest tube removal in 80 percent of patients. Selecting patients for pleurodesis based on pleural fluid drainage &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> may improve success rates. Thoracic duct embolization or disruption where available are additional approaches.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a traumatic chylothorax (eg, nonsurgical or postoperative) and large volume drainage of chylous fluid (&gt;1 L per day) who can tolerate surgery, we recommend early thoracic duct ligation (eg, within 3 to 7 days) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Pleurodesis may be performed at the time of thoracic duct ligation via mechanical abrasion or insufflation of talc. Thoracic duct embolization or disruption where available are additional approaches. (See <a href=\"#H1067400\" class=\"local\">'Pleurodesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1067407\" class=\"local\">'Thoracic duct ligation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H88586908\" class=\"local\">'Nonsurgical traumatic chylothorax'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a traumatic chylothorax (eg, nonsurgical or postoperative) and continued pleural drainage after 14 days of conservative therapy, failed pleurodesis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> failed thoracic duct embolization or disruption, we recommend thoracic duct ligation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). A longer duration of conservative therapy is associated with nutritional depletion and high mortality rates. Earlier surgical intervention is indicated for patients who appear unlikely to respond to conservative measures or with initially compromised nutritional status. Pleurodesis may be performed at the time of thoracic duct ligation via mechanical abrasion or insufflation of talc. (See <a href=\"#H1067407\" class=\"local\">'Thoracic duct ligation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1067400\" class=\"local\">'Pleurodesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H88586908\" class=\"local\">'Nonsurgical traumatic chylothorax'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1067463\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative (surgical) chylothorax'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a chylothorax in a postpneumonectomy space and mediastinal shift toward the side of the pneumonectomy, we suggest dietary control measures <strong>without</strong> chest tube drainage (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Shift of the mediastinum away from the midline suggests development of tension chylothorax, which if associated with hemodynamic compromise, requires urgent placement of a chest tube, followed by surgery to gain control of the lymphatic leak. (See <a href=\"#H175735402\" class=\"local\">'Postpneumonectomy chylothorax'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapies, such as <span class=\"nowrap\">somatostatin/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a>,</span> are typically employed as supplemental interventions after initiation of chest tube drainage.
