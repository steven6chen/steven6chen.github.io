The diffuse gliomas are further subdivided according to isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status and the presence or absence of codeletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

This can be accomplished by surgical resection or with a stereotactic biopsy. Biopsy alone is used in situations where the lesion is not amenable to resection, a meaningful amount of tumor tissue cannot be removed, or the patient's overall clinical condition will not permit a more aggressive surgery. </p><p>For patients with a newly diagnosed high-grade glioma, maximal surgical resection consistent with preservation of neurologic function is preferred. Although gross total resection is preferred whenever possible, subtotal resection or stereotactic biopsy may be required depending upon the location and extent of the tumor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, initial surgical approach, and prognosis of high-grade gliomas&quot;, section on 'Extent of resection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ADJUVANT RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-grade gliomas are infiltrative tumors with microscopic disease extending into the adjacent brain parenchyma to the gross tumor, which is typically defined by the radiographic abnormality. Adjuvant RT directed to residual microscopic and gross disease is not curative but improves local control and survival after resection compared with surgery or chemotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/2-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment target</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Involved field RT is the standard approach for adjuvant RT in patients with high-grade gliomas. The rationale for limiting the RT field is based upon the observation that recurrent high-grade glioma following whole brain RT (WBRT) develops within 2 cm of the original tumor site in 80 to 90 percent of cases, while less than 10 percent are multifocal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].</p><p>To encompass infiltrating tumor cells, the RT dose (typically 60 Gy) is usually delivered to the tumor plus a margin of radiographically apparently normal tissue. Most commonly, the RT target volume is defined primarily by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormality with a 1.0- to 2.0-cm margin. If the T1 contrast-enhancement volume is used for radiation planning, this is typically a subset of the T2-defined tumor, and a margin of 2.0 to 2.5 cm is often used to define the target volume to be treated to 60 Gy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3209975009\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adequate doses of RT are required to maximize the survival benefit. In early studies of RT for malignant glioma, patients who had RT doses of 50 to 60 Gy had a longer median survival than those who received lower postoperative RT doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. These studies established 60 Gy, delivered over six weeks in 2-Gy fractions, as the standard target dose for glioblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>There are no data comparing optimal dose and schedule in anaplastic gliomas versus glioblastoma. However, many radiation oncologists use a dose of 59.4 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions for grade III tumors versus 60 Gy in 2-Gy fractions for grade IV tumors with the expectation that the 10 percent dose reduction per fraction may lead to reduced late normal tissue effects for patients with projected longer-term survival.</p><p>Dose escalation above 60 Gy using conventionally fractionated RT, hyperfractionation, brachytherapy, or stereotactic radiosurgical boost has not been shown to provide further benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/7,8,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,15-17</a>]. Dose escalation to the contrast-enhancing volume using contemporary techniques continues to be investigated in glioblastoma and is the subject of an ongoing clinical trial (<a href=\"https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02179086?term=NRG-BN001&cond=Glioblastoma&rank=1&amp;token=Rti1NBSWdX//H/lCKGrzlGu03gYcMJXuTK3xOgZRWSzh35RvrgLNrXQnXVeh/jIk3cFLFckhqDggTmlTSi55ZA5G8zQlNLKJ2Z1c4JO/3rblOtewtY8x9abYkik2O72mC4BRDSW0aecvoZVRB6H4rA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5225\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT02179086</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H708302804\"><span class=\"h2\">Planning and delivery methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT) and intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) are two of the most common methods of planning and delivering involved field RT for high-grade gliomas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">3D-conformal RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of 3D treatment planning has enabled a significant decrease in the amount of normal brain irradiated as compared with the two-dimensional planning era [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Current 3D-CRT uses computed tomography (CT)-based treatment planning with dosimetric software to create composite treatment plans. Fusion of planning CT with MRI is extremely helpful in assisting with target definition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Photons of 6 to 8 megavolts (MV) are most commonly used with three to four angled radiation beams.</p><p>Radiation oncologists work with medical physicists and dosimetrists to design optimal treatment plans. Considerations in treatment planning include beam energy, field size and shape, beam modifiers, irradiated tissue density and heterogeneity, and radiation tolerance of surrounding normal tissues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Intensity-modulated RT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IMRT is a technique that relies upon software and modification of standard linear accelerator output to vary the radiation intensity across each treatment field. IMRT provides particular advantages when the target is juxtaposed with radiation-sensitive structures. IMRT most commonly employs five, seven, or nine treatment beams from different directions, with each field being from a stationary direction, but in which the radiation output varies across the field with time of irradiation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment#H1070824621\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;, section on 'Intensity-modulated radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Volumetric arc modulation radiotherapy (VMAT) is a form of IMRT that utilizes arc-based treatment delivery in which the radiation source is moving in an arc around the patient while delivering the radiation treatment. VMAT delivery is more efficient and requires approximately half the time that IMRT requires. </p><p>The application of IMRT and VMAT in the treatment of high-grade gliomas has become increasingly prevalent, as it significantly decreases the volume of normal tissue treated to high doses, which may decrease radiation-related adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. IMRT and VMAT can also be used to more safely escalate doses to the tumor, but there are no proven benefits to delivering doses beyond 60 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. </p><p>The most appropriate application of IMRT in the brain is likely to be when the radiation target approximates radiation-sensitive structures such as the eyes, optic nerves, optic chiasm, or brainstem. The disadvantages of IMRT include increased low-dose radiation distribution to surrounding nontarget tissues and the complexity of radiation planning, which requires adaptation of the hardware of linear accelerators and skilled medical physics support.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1293406718\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute side effects occurring during standard fractionated brain RT are typically mild and manageable with basic supportive care. Fatigue, loss of appetite, radiation dermatitis, and alopecia are the most commonly encountered toxicities during brain RT. Management of these and other side effects is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complications-of-cranial-irradiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complications of cranial irradiation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are multiple potential long-term complications of brain irradiation, including neurocognitive toxicity, RT-induced leukoencephalopathy, and endocrinopathies. The use of involved field RT lowers the risk of some but not all of these toxicities compared with WBRT. Risk also varies by dose, age, area of the brain receiving radiation, and concurrent therapies.

There are no formal clinical trials that define the optimal frequency for follow-up after treatment. Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommend that a repeat MRI should be obtained in patients with a high-grade glioma approximately four weeks after completion of RT, then every two to four months for two to three years, and less frequently thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>High-grade gliomas have traditionally been assessed using the Macdonald criteria, which rely upon measurement of areas of contrast enhancement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Treatment of gliomas in patients with a history of prior cranial irradiation is a particular concern because of the increased risk of late radiation-related side effects, including neurocognitive deficits and radiation necrosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-brain-tumors#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for brain tumors&quot;, section on 'Ionizing radiation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed complications of cranial irradiation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, partial brain reirradiation to therapeutic doses for gliomas is considered acceptable with at least a five-year interval between radiation exposures. The survival benefit and safety of reirradiation as a component of therapy in glioma patients with prior cranial irradiation was supported by a review of the literature that identified a total of 92 cases of secondary high-grade glioma related to prior brain RT (mostly for a prior brain tumor or leukemia), of which 35 underwent reirradiation to a median dose of 50 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The one- and two-year survival rates were increased compared with the 57 patients who were not reirradiated (59 versus 15, and 21 versus 3 percent, respectively). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2056580196\"><span class=\"h2\">Role in recurrent glioblastoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of reirradiation in patients with recurrent glioblastoma is uncertain, and clinical trials are ongoing.

Brachytherapy permits the delivery of a large radiation dose to the tumor volume, with rapid falloff in surrounding tissues.</p><p>Despite the theoretical dosimetric and radiobiologic advantages of brachytherapy, randomized clinical trials have shown marginal or no benefit for the use of brachytherapy in the treatment of high-grade gliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/16,17,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,32,33</a>].</p><p>Brachytherapy is technically complex, and its applicability is limited because the effective radiation dose is limited to within a few millimeters of the seeds, and gliomas are inherently infiltrative into normal-appearing brain.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant RT'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-postoperative-therapy-for-glioblastoma-and-anaplastic-astrocytoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial postoperative therapy for glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate doses of RT are required to maximize the survival benefit. Typical doses of RT used for high-grade glioma are 59.4 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions for grade III tumors and 60 Gy in 2-Gy fractions for glioblastoma. Dose escalation above 60 Gy has not been shown to provide further benefit. (See <a href=\"#H3209975009\" class=\"local\">'Dose selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To encompass infiltrating tumor cells, RT is delivered to the tumor plus a margin of radiographically apparently normal tissue. Three-dimensional (3D) treatment planning has decreased the amount of normal brain irradiated compared with older techniques. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Treatment target'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue, loss of appetite, radiation dermatitis, and alopecia are the most commonly encountered side effects during brain RT. Patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> chemotherapy during RT are at risk for hematologic toxicity and should be monitored with weekly complete blood counts. (See <a href=\"#H1293406718\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3881025088\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring during use of concurrent temozolomide'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>De-escalated therapy is often appropriate for older adults with high-grade gliomas and those with poor performance status. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-glioblastoma-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of glioblastoma in older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast should be obtained approximately four weeks after completion of RT, then every two to four months for two to three years, and less frequently thereafter. (See <a href=\"#H3026966222\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of response and progression'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with radiation-induced gliomas related to prior history of brain RT, therapeutic reirradiation can generally be performed with at least a five-year interval between radiation exposures. The role of reirradiation in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas is uncertain, and clinical trials are ongoing. (See <a href=\"#H901173587\" class=\"local\">'Patients with radiation-induced gliomas'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2056580196\" class=\"local\">'Role in recurrent glioblastoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3390672860\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Tracy Batchelor, MD, MPH, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System, 4th ed, Louis DN, Ohgaki H, Wiestler OD, Cavenee WK (Eds), IARC, Lyon 2016.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-therapy-for-high-grade-gliomas/abstract/2\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Walker MD, Green SB, Byar DP, et al.
