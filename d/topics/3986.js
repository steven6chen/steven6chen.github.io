However, the initial symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia occur earlier at a median age of four to six years. These findings are due to tubular dysfunction resulting in impaired urinary concentrating ability and sodium reabsorption.

Homozygous deletions of approximately 250 kb on chromosome 2p12, the location of <em>NPHP1</em>, can be detected by the lack of amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) markers; this test permits a quick and accurate diagnosis of the disease in affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nephronophthisis/abstract/39,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,47</a>].

However, in cases where extrarenal findings are absent, NPHP can be distinguished from these other conditions using a variety of diagnostic tools, including renal imaging, genetic testing, and family history.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstructive uropathy &ndash; Presence of hydronephrosis on renal imaging is suggestive of obstructive uropathy and is not usually present in NPHP. However, a large bladder may be observed in patients with NPHP due to chronic polyuria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-obstruction-and-hydronephrosis#H411670693\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction and hydronephrosis&quot;, section on 'Radiographic findings'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic renal cystic disease in children includes early onset autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). These two disorders are often in the differential diagnosis for patients with the infantile form of NPHP. The diagnosis for either ADPKD or ARPKD is straightforward when there is a positive family history, including screening parents for ADKPD. Renal imaging may be equivocal in differentiating amongst these entities. In the setting where no family history is present and renal imaging is equivocal, genetic testing is performed to make a definite diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal hypodysplasia &ndash; The presence of significantly smaller kidneys on renal ultrasonography (reduction by greater than two standard deviations) usually will differentiate renal hypodysplasia from NPHP with normal or slightly smaller kidneys. Renal hypodysplasia is observed in over 200 syndromic disorders where anomalies involving other organs are present. As a result, nonrenal findings not associated with NPHP would also be helpful in differentiating between these two disorders.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no specific therapy for NPHP. Management of children in the early stage of the disease without renal impairment is supportive and is focused on maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance and promoting normal growth. Interventions are directed towards replacing ongoing water needs to prevent episodes of hypovolemia and providing adequate salt intake especially during intercurrent illnesses that may alter the fluid and electrolyte needs and status.</p><p>Patients with NPHP uniformly progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Renal transplantation is the preferred replacement therapy because outcome is excellent, as tubular injury does not recur in the transplanted kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nephronophthisis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In a report from the North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies (NAPRTCS) Registry, the outcome of renal transplantation for patients with NPHP was better compared with the overall general pediatric transplant population, especially for patients who received living donor kidney transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-nephronophthisis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nephronophthisis (NPHP) is an autosomal recessive disorder that is characterized by impaired urinary concentrating ability and sodium reabsorption, a bland urinalysis (no proteinuria, hematuria, or cellular elements), chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, and progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) generally by 20 years of age.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NPHP is a result of gene mutations that encode proteins involved in the function of primary cilia, basal bodies, or centrosomes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-nephronophthisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics and pathogenesis of nephronophthisis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical variants have been described based upon the median age of onset of ESRD. These variants are associated with specific gene defects. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Renal disease'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-nephronophthisis#H174931069\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics and pathogenesis of nephronophthisis&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The <strong>infantile</strong> form (median onset of ESRD by one year of age) is associated with mutations in the <em>NPHP2</em> and <em>NPHP3</em> genes. Patients typically have large kidneys with large cysts and are more likely than other variants to have extrarenal abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H2952264336\" class=\"local\">'Infantile'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The <strong>juvenile</strong> form (median onset of ESRD is 13 years of age) is the most common variant. It is associated with mutations in all the <em>NPHP</em> genes except <em>NPHP2</em>. These patients initially present with symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia due to impaired urinary concentration and sodium reabsorption, and subsequent progression to ESRD. These patients typically have a &quot;bland&quot; urinalysis without evidence of proteinuria, hematuria, or cellular elements. Ultrasonography demonstrates normal or slightly decreased-in-size kidneys with increased echogenicity and loss of corticomedullary differentiation. (See <a href=\"#H2973855628\" class=\"local\">'Juvenile'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The <strong>adolescent</strong> form (median onset of ESRD by 19 years of age) is associated with mutations in the <em>NPHP3</em> genes. Patients also exhibit initial symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia due to reduced concentrating ability and sodium conservation but at a later age than those with the juvenile variant. (See <a href=\"#H1160349510\" class=\"local\">'Adolescent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Late-onset <strong>(adult)</strong> &ndash; There are reports of patients with NPHP who develop ESRD in adulthood between the ages of 27 and 56 years. In some cases, extrarenal manifestations precede the clinical onset of chronic kidney disease (CKD). (See <a href=\"#H856387337\" class=\"local\">'Late-onset'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall, extrarenal manifestations are observed in 20 percent of patients with NPHP. They include retinitis pigmentosa, skeletal defects, hepatic fibrosis, neurologic abnormalities and cardiac defects. (See <a href=\"#H73561562\" class=\"local\">'Extrarenal manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NPHP is a major clinical finding in several syndromes, including Senior-Loken (combination of retinitis pigmentosa), Joubert, Meckel-Gruber, Cogan, and Sensenbrenner syndromes, and asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD, also known as Jeune syndrome). (See <a href=\"#H73561245\" class=\"local\">'Associated syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of NPHP is suspected by characteristic clinical findings and confirmed by a genetic testing. In the absence of a positive gene test, a renal biopsy demonstrating chronic tubulointerstitial changes with a thickening of tubular basement membranes is suggestive of the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-and-pathogenesis-of-nephronophthisis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics and pathogenesis of nephronophthisis&quot;, section on 'Pathology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis for NPHP includes other chronic kidney disorders with a bland urinalysis. These disorders include renal hypodysplasia, urinary tract obstruction, and polycystic kidney disease (PKD). The presence of associated extrarenal findings is useful to differentiate NPHP from these conditions. When extrarenal manifestations are absent, a variety of diagnostic tools, including renal imaging, genetic testing, and family history are used to distinguish NPHP. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no specific treatment for NPHP. Management of children in the early stage of the disease without renal impairment is supportive focused on maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance and growth promotion. For patients with ESRD, we recommend renal transplantation as the preferred renal replacement therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The outcome of renal transplantation is excellent, as tubular injury does not recur in the transplanted kidney.
