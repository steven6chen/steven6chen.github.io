Venous stenosis may also be corrected by surgical revision or endovascular stent placement. (Stent placement is reviewed separately.) Compared with surgical revision, percutaneous angioplasty has the principal advantage of preserving potential venous access sites by avoiding jump grafts and sacrificing a segment of vein. </p><p>Percutaneous intervention for the treatment of hemodialysis arteriovenous access stenosis is an outpatient procedure, with the access immediately available for dialysis once the lesion is corrected. Lesions in all locations within the arteriovenous access and its draining veins, both peripheral and central, are effectively and safely treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There is minimal to no blood loss, hospitalization is avoided, and there is minimal postprocedure discomfort. However, approximately 15 percent of lesions may be resistant to dilation or elastic, recoiling after what initially appeared to be a successful dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In a study of 102 angioplasty procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], two cases were noted that could not be treated even using pressures up to 40 atm. In another study, which analyzed 154 stenotic lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], a 15 percent incidence of elastic lesions was observed. The elastic lesion was defined as recurrent luminal narrowing greater than 50 percent within 15 minutes after full effacement of the stenosis by the angioplasty balloon. </p><p>Techniques used for percutaneous angioplasty of arteriovenous hemodialysis access are reviewed here. Issues related to monitoring and diagnosis of stenosis of chronic hemodialysis access and indications for intervention in patients with hemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas and grafts are discussed in detail separately.

A dysfunctional arteriovenous (AV) access is often obvious by physical examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maturation-and-evaluation-of-the-newly-created-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maturation and evaluation of the newly created hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-arteriovenous-graft\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the arteriovenous graft&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The preprocedure examination of the hemodialysis arteriovenous access is important for several reasons.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to proceeding with an invasive procedure, it is important to verify the problem for which the patient was referred. In the author's experience, at least 10 percent of patients referred do not have a problem that warrants a procedure. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It will help plan the approach to intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It provides the interventionalist with a baseline for comparison postprocedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is necessary for identifying any contraindications to the procedure.</p><p/><p>The physical examination is relatively sensitive for the most common types of lesions for an AV fistula, but less so for an AV graft. Physical examination alone is not particularly good for identifying central lesions. Ultrasound examination improves the sensitivity and is inexpensive (often does not create a separate charge). Thus, most interventionalists would prefer to confirm the presence of a treatable lesion using Doppler ultrasound prior to subjecting the patient to an angiogram. </p><p>Local anesthesia is all that is needed to gain access to the fistula or graft; however, because balloon angioplasty of stenotic lesions in the native vessels is potentially very painful, adequate sedation needs to be provided. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Midazolam</a> hydrochloride, alone or in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>, can been used to produce a state of relaxation for the 5 to 10 minutes required to perform angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Since the requirement for adequate sedation varies from patient to patient, the patient should be monitored for discomfort and the dosage titrated as needed. Supplemental nasal oxygen should be provided, and all patients require hemodynamic monitoring. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-adults-outside-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in adults outside the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3334700561\"><span class=\"h1\">LESION CONFIRMATION AND SELECTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108086703\"><span class=\"h2\">Cannulating the access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cannulation of the arteriovenous (AV) access proceeds in a manner that is similar to needle placement prior to dialysis using the site selected in the preprocedure examination. To aid cannulation, manual compression or use of a sterile tourniquet above the cannulation site helps engorge the vein. There are no real mechanical differences between the cannulation of an AV fistula or an AV graft; however, in general, an AV fistula is somewhat more difficult to cannulate than an AV graft. The AV fistula is more easily compressed, and more caution is needed to avoid passing the needle through the back wall of the vessel. In addition, a dysfunctional AV fistula, particularly one that has failed to mature, is more difficult to palpate. For these reasons, a micropuncture (21-gauge) needle is preferred. However, a standard (18-gauge) introducer needle is adequate and works well for accessing a mature AV fistula or graft. In cases in which cannulation is problematic, ultrasound-guided cannulation can be very helpful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of ultrasound-guided venous access&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Several considerations need to be taken into account during selection of the access site. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The needle must be directed toward the stenotic lesion (either antegrade or retrograde). The preprocedure examination should identify the most likely location of the stenosis. (See <a href=\"#H3468458797\" class=\"local\">'Preprocedure evaluation and preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The access insertion site should lie in a straight line with the suspected lesion to facilitate placement of the balloon catheter unless the distance from the access site to the lesion is relatively short (ie, several centimeters). Passing the catheter tip through the stenosis when there is resistance will be more difficult if the catheter needs to first negotiate a curve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An adequate distance needs to be provided between the access site and the suspected lesion to accommodate the placement of an intravascular sheath through which the intravascular devices (eg, balloon, stent) are usually passed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If large aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms are present and the target lesion lies beyond them, it may be advantageous to cannulate above these areas to avoid the problems of passing a guidewire through them. </p><p/><p>Once the introducer needle has been placed, a guidewire is inserted over which an intravascular sheath is placed. An intravascular sheath should always be used (rare exceptions) for this procedure to maintain the access site and for the administration of intravenous radiocontrast for angiography, and medications, as needed. The size of the sheath is determined by the anticipated diameter of the angioplasty balloon that will be used. The required minimal sheath size for each balloon catheter is specified by the manufacturer on the label. The size designation for a sheath refers to the inner diameter of the sheath. In general, a 6-French sheath is appropriate for standard 8-mm angioplasty balloon catheters, which have a shaft diameter of 5 or 5.8 mm. However, if a larger balloon is needed, a larger sheath will be necessary. Some interventionalists prefer a 7-French sheath, which produces a 9-French or 3-mm hole in the vessel, as their routine sheath to be certain that there will be no difficulties removing the balloon after inflation, and to avoid having to upsize to a larger sheath in the event that a larger balloon is needed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4174041578\"><span class=\"h2\">Preprocedure angiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An angiogram should be performed to evaluate the anatomy of the AV access and its draining veins prior to any intervention. It is important to evaluate the entire access circuit up to the superior vena cava since multiple lesions are seen in many cases, both in AV grafts and AV fistulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/1,6,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,12-15</a>]. All lesions should be documented for later reference. It is also important to evaluate the arterial portion of the circuit by looking at the arterial anastomosis and adjacent feeding artery. A retrograde arteriogram is accomplished by injecting radiocontrast while manually occluding the access downstream from the injection site unless thrombus is present. Any evaluation of the arterial circulation prior to or following the thrombectomy should be done using a catheter in order to avoid the risk of an arterial embolus.</p><p>Direct observation is necessary to perform AV access interventions. Although ultrasound-guided procedures have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>], fluoroscopy with digital subtraction capability has advantages for identifying the presence and extent of pathology, positioning of devices (eg, wires, balloon, stents), and for the management of complications, should one occur. Systemic anticoagulation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>) is unnecessary except in cases associated with thrombosis (thrombectomy procedure) because of the high blood flow rate in the dialysis access. For treatment of thrombosed hemodialysis AV access, we use 3000 to 5000 units of intravenous unfractionated heparin to prevent rethrombosis of the graft. During dilatation, flow is occluded for only short intermittent periods, and clotting of a patent AV access rarely occurs. In cases in which multiple lesions are to be treated and it is anticipated that the access will be occluded for more than a short interval, or in cases of severe widespread venous spasm, administration of unfractionated heparin may be needed. </p><p>Hemodialysis access angiography is usually accomplished using iodinated radiocontrast agents (nonionic) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83944\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83944 \">table 1</a>). The volume of radiocontrast needed is generally less than 50 mL. For patient with less severe radiocontrast allergy, premedication may be adequate. Dosing regimens are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to radiocontrast media: Prevention of recurrent reactions&quot;, section on 'Premedication regimens'</a>.)</p><p>However, carbon dioxide has been used as an alternative, especially in patients with severe idiosyncratic reactions to radiocontrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. If carbon dioxide is used, it should be injected into the venous limb of the fistula or graft or at the arterial anastomosis to prevent reflux of gas into the proximal arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Pulmonary hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease represent relative contraindications to the intravenous use of carbon dioxide. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4149916392\"><span class=\"h3\">Criteria for treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most instances, the patient has been referred to the treatment facility because of an abnormality that was detected at the dialysis clinic. Such abnormalities may include (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-monitoring-and-surveillance-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical monitoring and surveillance of the mature hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monitoring and surveillance of hemodialysis arteriovenous grafts to prevent thrombosis&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal physical findings</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreasing intragraft blood flow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated static pressure within the graft</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recirculation or declining urea clearance</p><p/><p>In evaluating access dysfunction, areas of vessel narrowing may be recognized on angiography. The question frequently arises as to which of these should be treated. To qualify for treatment, the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative <span class=\"nowrap\">(NKF-K/DOQI)</span> Practice Guidelines state that a stenotic lesion should cause a greater than 50 percent decrease in the luminal diameter <strong>and</strong> be associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">clinical/physiological</span> abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. It should be emphasized that the key indication for treatment of stenosis is the presence of pathophysiology, not simply abnormal anatomy. In fact, there is evidence that the treatment of anatomical lesions without pathophysiology may be detrimental [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2622405141\" class=\"local\">'Determination of significant stenosis'</a> below.)</p><p>It should also be realized that the effect of multiple lesions of less than 50 percent stenosis can be additive. The key issue is pathophysiology. If the flow rate is low, there is a reason for it. In some instances, it is the additive effect of lesions, which, of themselves individually, would not warrant treatment. Clinical judgment is required in these cases.</p><p>Angioplasty of a hemodynamically significant stenosis associated with a dysfunctional, but not thrombosed, AV vascular access can maintain functionality and delay thrombosis, but there is no convincing evidence that treatment of an asymptomatic anatomic stenosis, even if there is greater than 50 percent narrowing, has any beneficial effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. We do <strong>NOT</strong> treat anatomic stenosis (&gt;50 percent diameter reduction) that is not associated with a hemodynamic, functional, or clinical abnormality. Asymptomatic lesions are better managed by simple observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. For central venous stenosis, this was illustrated in a retrospective study of 35 patients that compared the natural history of high-grade (&gt;50 percent) asymptomatic central venous stenosis and the outcome of treatment with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. No untreated lesion progressed to symptoms, stent placement, or additional stenosis, whereas 8 percent of treated cases developed stenosis or symptom escalation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2622405141\"><span class=\"h3\">Determination of significant stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The determination of the degree of stenosis depends upon the site of the lesion. The varying sites are discussed separately. </p><p>In general, the degree of stenosis is determined based upon angiographic comparison of the diameter in the stenotic region with the adjacent vessel or graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/1,6,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,27</a>]. At the venous anastomosis of an AV graft, there is often a significant diameter discrepancy between the graft and the adjacent &quot;normal&quot; vein, such that in this instance, the comparison used for the diagnosis should be the graft. </p><p>The inflow of the AV access is composed of the feeding artery, the anastomosis, and the juxta-anastomotic access (2 cm downstream from the arterial anastomosis). Stenosis of the artery or the juxta-anastomotic access can easily be determined by comparing the size relative to the adjacent normal vessel or graft. Judging the degree of stenosis at the arterial anastomosis stenosis is more difficult because the size of the anastomosis depends on its construction, which may vary from surgeon to surgeon, but it is generally smaller than the adjacent artery. In addition, there is always a major drop in pressure across the arterial anastomosis. Some surgeons use a tapered AV graft that may somewhat resemble a stenosis. It has been suggested that anastomotic stenosis should be defined by comparing the diameter of the anastomosis with the adjacent normal artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. If the difference is 50 percent or greater, the anastomosis should be classified as stenotic. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100157756\"><span class=\"h3\">Pseudostenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all lesions that looks like a stenosis are actually a stenosis. Venous spasm is probably the most common cause of &quot;pseudostenosis,&quot; but external compression can also cause confusion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Venous spasm &ndash; Venous spasm is relatively common. At times, simply passing a guidewire can precipitate spasm. It may be localized or it may be more generalized. Spasm can easily be confused for a stenotic lesion if one is not careful. When a vein is first examined fluoroscopically, it is important to note the location, appearance, and extent of all lesions that are present. After angioplasty, if a new lesion has appeared, it is vessel spasm. Attempts at dilatation may worsen the spasm and expose normal vein to the potential for endothelial damage in response to the pressure of the angioplasty balloon. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>External compression &ndash; There are a variety of ways that extrinsic pressure can give rise to an artifactual appearance of stenosis. In patients with an ectatic aorta, the left brachiocephalic vein can be compressed either by the aortic arch or by the vessels coming off of the arch. In very muscular dialysis patients, a muscle imprint can lead to an erroneous suspicion of stenosis of the axillary vein when the arm is adducted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In very thin (cachectic) patients, the cephalic vein as it crosses the shoulder with the patient lying flat may look stenotic due to compression. A large breast or even a tight drape can also cause confusion at times. Although these latter situations do not usually have any hemodynamic consequence, extrinsic compression of the left brachiocephalic vein from an ectatic aorta can result in elevated venous pressure, and collateral veins can develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1868253025\"><span class=\"h2\">Character of the lesion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Considerable variability is seen in the character of venous stenosis relating to location, length, severity of narrowing, and number of stenotic sites. There is nothing to suggest that treatment using angioplasty should be avoided for any specific type of lesion. In one review, the duration of unassisted patency for each category of lesion studied was statistically comparable to that of the entire group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. No significant differences were seen for length of lesion, multiple lesions, or location of the lesion. Although severity of the stenosis was not specifically evaluated in this study, it has not proven to be a factor for determining the success of angioplasty. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access#H2036071698\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular intervention for the treatment of stenosis in the arteriovenous access&quot;, section on 'Sites of stenotic lesions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3289219492\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrent stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although venous stenosis tends to recur, repeat treatment is usually successful. However, if a lesion is recurring at a frequent interval, elasticity of the lesion is often the cause, and an alternative to what has been previously done, such as placement of a stent, stent-graft, or surgical correction, should be considered. The <span class=\"nowrap\">NKF-K/DOQI</span> guidelines suggest that if repeat angioplasty is required more than twice within three months, the patient should be referred for surgical revision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access#H3472236968\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular intervention for the treatment of stenosis in the arteriovenous access&quot;, section on 'Referral and diagnostic testing'</a>.)</p><p>Once intravascular access has been achieved and lesions have been identified on angiography, a guidewire is then passed through the sheath and advanced to the level of the central veins. Because an angioplasty balloon is relatively stiff, it should never be advanced without a guidewire; otherwise, serious damage to the vessel can occur. But if the guidewire cannot be passed through the lesion, angioplasty cannot be performed. There is tremendous variability among different operators with respect to guidewire preference. But it is important that the guidewire size match the requirements for the devices that will be used. A simple 0.035-inch guidewire is adequate to start with for most cases. Guidewire manipulation may be needed in cases where the vein is tortuous. At times, a specialized guidewire may be required, or alternatively, a guiding catheter can be used to assist passage of the guidewire. Once the guidewire is in place, the angioplasty balloon catheter can be advanced to the most central lesion. If additional lesions are present, they are sequentially treated by moving peripherally in the extremity. Going from central to peripheral in the treatment of multiple lesions is important in order to ensure that the outflow from the lesion being treated is wide open. If it is not, the incidence of complications (vein rupture) may be increased and such a complication will be made worse if increased pressure is generated by downstream resistance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108087135\"><span class=\"h2\">Angioplasty balloons</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The important information needed to make a proper balloon choice is provided on the catheter label. The coaxial angioplasty balloon catheter has two lumens. One is used is used as the passageway for the guidewire and the other is used to inflate the balloon. Desirable features for an angioplasty balloon are maintenance of the designed shape at high pressure (low compliance), ability to track over guidewire and to cross a tight lesion (low profile and crossability), and rupture resistance (strength). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All standard angioplasty balloons are noncompliant; balloon compliance is not desirable in an angioplasty balloon. The angioplasty balloon is inflated with fluid and its chamber will expand only to a predetermined size and little more (less than 5 percent). Rather than continuing to expand with increasing pressure, it becomes firmer, exerting greater force while still retaining its shape and configuration, unless it ruptures. Although rupture of an angioplasty balloon from excessive pressure should not create a problem, rupture should be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small-profile balloon catheter permits the use of a smaller-diameter sheath to accommodate passage, resulting in a smaller defect in the vessel wall and skin. The size of sheath for a particular balloon is listed as &quot;recommended introducer&quot; on the angioplasty balloon catheter label. Once an angioplasty balloon has been inflated, it does not return to its former pre-use profile. For this reason, an angioplasty balloon should not be pre-expanded before initial use. If a balloon will be reused, it should be resized before it is reintroduced into the sheath. This is done by forcing the balloon cover back over the balloon to compress it to a smaller profile. Some manufacturers provide a short cylinder with flared ends located on the balloon shaft for this purpose. Resizing does not return the balloon to its original size, but it does reduce it considerably. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rupture resistance is an important feature of angioplasty balloons. All balloons have a pressure rating listed on the package, stated as rated burst pressure in atmospheres (atm), which is the pressure at or below which the manufacturer has a 95 percent level of confidence that the balloon will not rupture with a single inflation, 99.9 percent of the time. Exceeding this pressure is not recommended; however, there is actually some safety margin in this stated value. One study evaluated five different angioplasty balloon brands and found that with all types, overinflation by 5 to 6 atm could be safely accomplished without rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Most operators do not hesitate to apply pressures of 20 atmospheres to a balloon rated at 16. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3543307557\"><span class=\"h3\">Type</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several types of specialty angioplasty balloons are available including high pressure, ultra-high pressure, cutting, and drug eluting.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-pressure balloons &ndash; The typical angioplasty balloons used for treating dialysis vascular access stenosis are referred to as high-pressure balloons. Low-pressure balloons, typically made of latex or silicone, are used primarily for clot extraction and occlusion (eg, the Fogarty catheter is a low-pressure balloon). High-pressure balloons have a pressure rating ranging from 16 to 20 atm. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultra-high-pressure balloons &ndash; Ultra-high-pressure balloons have a manufacturer's burst-pressure rating in the range of 30 atm. Although more expensive than standard balloon catheters, these higher-rated balloons are very useful for extremely resistant venous lesions. Ultra-high-pressure balloons can often be used successfully up to pressures of 40 atm. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutting balloons &ndash; The cutting-balloon is a special angioplasty balloon that has three or four sharp blades called atherotomes that are longitudinally bonded to its surface. These are microsurgical blades that are sharper than conventional surgical blades. The atherotomes expand radially with balloon inflation, incising the lesion. Cutting balloon angioplasty has been used as a primary treatment of stenotic lesions to reduce vascular trauma by producing a more controlled wall incision rather than an irregular tear, and as a secondary treatment of lesions that are resistant to standard angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. Few randomized trials have evaluated cutting balloon angioplasty for the treatment of hemodialysis AV access. Most data are from small, observational studies. Technical success is overall high, generally reported up to the range of 100 percent. Six-month primary patency rates range from 76 to 92 percent. Extravasation is the main complication, but the incidence is low. The available trials suggest there may be a benefit for primary treatment of lesions occurring at the graft-to-vein anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/28,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,37,38</a>]. However, its value at other sites is questionable. There is some evidence to support cutting balloon angioplasty as a treatment for resistant lesions, but larger studies are needed. In addition, less costly alternatives are available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug-eluting balloons &ndash; Based upon the success that has been obtained in treating arterial stenotic lesions with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> drug-eluting balloon angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>], several investigators have applied this technology to the dialysis vascular access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/41-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-44</a>]. Preliminary results have been promising; however, studies have been small and underpowered, or uncontrolled. Additional studies are needed before any definitive conclusions can be drawn.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3705112124\"><span class=\"h3\">Diameter and length</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angioplasty balloons are available in a wide variety of sizes, which are registered as diameter measured in millimeters and length measured in centimeters (eg, an 8 x 4 balloon would be 8 mm in diameter and 4 cm in length). The balloon diameter is measured fully inflated. The length of the balloon is the distance between the two radiopaque markers that are within the balloon. The balloon is actually slightly longer than its stated length because of its tapered shoulders. This portion of the balloon does not participate appreciably in its therapeutic function because of its reduced diameter. </p><p>When performing venous angioplasty, it is recommended that the balloon diameter exceed the diameter of the vessel by 10 to 15 percent (1 to 2 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. By contrast, with arterial angioplasty, the balloon diameter should match the diameter of the artery. Individualization of the balloon size for each lesion is necessary to avoid undertreatment from too small a balloon or the increased risk of complications from a balloon that is sized too large.</p><p>There are several factors to consider in selecting a length. First, the relationship between the catheter and the guidewire is important. When passing a catheter over the guidewire, the back end of the guidewire must extend beyond the back end of the catheter and still have enough length within the vessel to maintain the access. This is also critical when difficulty has been encountered with the passing of a guidewire across a centrally located lesion. If it is necessary to pull the guidewire back so far that position is lost in order to insert the catheter, it can be problematic. Second, the catheter must be long enough to reach central venous lesions. Third, even though length is important, one does not want to have to use a guidewire that is so long that it is cumbersome. The standard guidewire length used in procedures performed on dialysis access is 145 to 150 cm. A catheter length of 75 cm appears to be optimal. This is long enough to reach the right atrium from a wrist insertion site in most patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108088353\"><span class=\"h2\">Balloon inflation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H860087775\"><span class=\"h3\">Inflation devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Balloon inflation can be accomplished with a saline-filled syringe or an inflation (insufflation) device. </p><p>Balloon dilation using a syringe works quite well, is economical, and is generally quicker than an inflation device. An acrylic syringe with a high-pressure stopcock is required; an ordinary syringe will not work for this purpose, and neither will a standard three-way stopcock, as these will not hold sufficient pressure. The pressure generated by a syringe is related to the ratio of the diameter of the plunger to the diameter of the orifice of the syringe. Thus, the smaller the syringe diameter, the greater the pressure that will be applied; 20-cc, 10-cc, and 3-cc syringes will generate approximately 10 atm, 20 atm, and 30 atm of pressure, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Many interventionalists prefer to use a syringe for inflating an angioplasty balloon because it gives them a better &quot;feel&quot; when trying to dilate a difficult lesion. We recommend using a syringe filled with dilute radiocontrast connected to a three-way stopcock, with a 10-cc syringe connected in-line with the catheter and a 3-cc syringe connected to the side port. In this manner, the volume of the 10-cc syringe can be used to fill the balloon and the 3-cc syringe can be used to apply pressure to achieve the balloon dilation. Radiocontrast is necessary in order for the balloon to be visible under fluoroscopy. This must be diluted for ease of injection and withdrawal so that it is not too viscous.</p><p>Although inflation devices allow one to quantitate the pressure, this is actually of little importance. There are a variety of inflation devices available, and all have the general appearance of a modified syringe (some are). The barrel is graduated in the same manner as a syringe. It has a Luer lock tip to which tubing and a three-way stopcock are attached to provide a connection to the balloon catheter. A pressure manometer, which registers the pressure measurement in atmospheres, is built into the side of the barrel. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108088360\"><span class=\"h3\">Dilation pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative <span class=\"nowrap\">(NKF-K/DOQI)</span> guidelines recommend that there should be no more than a 30 percent residual stenosis following angioplasty; however, we recommend that the goal should be <strong>no</strong> residual stenosis following treatment. Since a lesion that is being treated has been determined to be pathophysiologically significant, the goal should always be to eliminate the lesion and restore normal physiology. Some type of anatomic disruption, such as a break or tear, generally accompanies a successful angioplasty. If only stretching occurs, the likelihood of elastic recoil is high, and the angioplasty result will be inadequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>The pressure required to dilate a particular lesion varies. In one study involving 230 stenotic lesions in AV grafts or AV fistulas, the pressure required to treat the lesion ranged from 10 to 20 atm in the majority of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In 59 percent, the required pressure was &gt;15 atm, and 20 percent of AV fistula lesions and 9 percent of AV grafts lesion required a pressure &gt;20 atm. There are no definite guidelines relating to the amount of pressure that should be applied when performing angioplasty. But it is important to be aware of the rated burst pressure for the balloon being used. Exceeding this pressure is not recommended. The standard angioplasty balloon will actually tolerate more pressure than its stated burst pressure. How much more pressure it will tolerate varies for different manufacturers and even for different balloons from the same manufacturer. If the balloon's tolerance is exceeded, the balloon will rupture, and although this generally does not cause a problem, there is the potential for losing a portion of the balloon and, rarely, for damaging the vessel. For this reason, balloon rupture should be avoided. </p><p>When using a syringe assembly for dilatation, the pressure being applied is not being measured, but by watching the configuration of the shoulders of the balloon, one can usually identify when the balloon is on the verge of rupture. With most angioplasty balloons, both ends of the balloon are tapered. Before the balloon ruptures, the typically pointed configuration will change to a rounded appearance. At this point, additional pressure should not be applied and the pressure that is being applied should be reduced. There is no advantage from increasing inflation pressure beyond that need for full balloon effacement. In this setting, the interventionalist should switch to an ultra-high-pressure balloon, the use of which has markedly reduced the incidence of &quot;resistant&quot; lesions. In one study of 87 patients with venous stenosis treated with standard high-pressure balloons, seven cases (8 percent) were resistant to dilatation. Using the ultra-high-pressure design, 100 percent success was obtained in these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Venous angioplasty may be more effective if the vessel is overdilated by 20 to 30 percent. If total balloon effacement was observed, but recoil is observed following dilation, it is possible that a larger balloon might result in the type of anatomic disruption that would provide success; however, there is an increased risk of venous rupture with a larger balloon. This risk must be weighed against the fact that if the lesion cannot be successfully resolved, either with angioplasty or angioplasty plus stenting, surgical revision will be required. (See <a href=\"#H769593462\" class=\"local\">'Vein rupture'</a> below.)</p><p>The reported range of pressures required to obtain full effacement ranges from 5 to 40 atm, with most less than 20 atm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/33,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,47,48</a>]. Some lesion locations are notorious for being resistant to dilation (eg, the cephalic arch, the venous anastomosis of an AV graft) and will require high pressure. In a study of 230 lesions, 55 percent required balloon inflation pressures greater than 15 atm to efface the waist of the stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Excluding initial failures, 20 percent of lesions in native fistulas and 9 percent in grafts required very high pressure (&gt;20 atm) to efface the waist. Two (1 percent) could not be successfully treated with angioplasty in spite of the use of an ultra-high-pressure balloon. High pressure was needed less frequently in angioplasty procedures performed in the setting of thrombectomy compared with prophylactic angioplasty. Residual stenosis was positively correlated with severity of initial stenosis and negatively correlated with duration of inflation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108088367\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration of dilatation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another procedural variable associated with angioplasty is the optimal duration of dilation pressure. The goal of the angioplasty is to attain full effacement of the dilating balloon with no residual stenosis following the procedure (no elastic recoil). Residual stenosis is an important factor in determining duration of patency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Common practice is to deflate the balloon immediately once the waist created by the stenosis is fully effaced. Whether a more prolonged inflation time is of value was addressed in a randomized trial that assigned 48 patients to either a one-minute or three-minute inflation period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. There was no significant difference in technical success rates between the groups. In addition, there were also no differences in the one-, three-, and six-month patency rates following treatment. In a retrospective review, 223 interventions divided between 30-second and one-minute inflations were compared (178 with 30 seconds and 45 with one minute) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. There was no significant difference between the two groups for either immediate technical success or patency in the first three months.</p><p>Many interventionalists feel that if total effacement cannot be obtained or if the lesion is elastic, resulting in residual stenosis following full effacement, a prolonged dilatation of three to five minutes is of value in reaching the desired results. In one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] involving the treatment of 230 cases, elastic lesions were treated with prolonged dilatation. A negative correlation between the duration of dilatation and the degree of residual stenosis (ie, the longer the inflation, the less residual stenosis) was observed. In this report, specific dilatation times were not given; however, most of the times used for elastic lesions were five minutes.</p><p>Based upon these studies, we do not recommend a prolonged inflation time unless the initial results obtained are not optimal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108088374\"><span class=\"h3\">Handling multiple lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When multiple lesions are present that require treatment with angioplasty, we always start with the lesion that is the most proximal (downstream or central). This serves to decrease outflow resistance and helps to minimize the consequences of extravasation, if it occurs, since the severity of the extravasation is directly related to intra-access pressure, which is higher if the outflow is occluded. Another reason to start proximally is that it is much easier to pull a used angioplasty balloon back through a stenosis rather than advancing the now larger balloon profile through a tight narrowing. </p><p>However, this sequence is frequently not followed when both a peripheral and a central lesion are present. Unless the central lesion is very tight, it is customary to start with the peripheral lesion(s) first. This is done to avoid having to transition the larger balloon used for central lesions through peripheral stenoses going in, and especially coming out. On the other hand, if the central lesion is severe and is causing a significant increase in intravascular pressure peripherally, it would be better to start there to assure an open outflow in the event of a peripheral vessel rupture. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4184448981\"><span class=\"h3\">Preventing vein rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Taking precautionary measures to prevent procedure-related complications is always important. Unfortunately, this is not always effective. It is virtually impossible to predict when vein rupture will occur. However, there are a few situations where recognizing an increased risk is possible, and alternatives (stenting or surgical treatment) can be considered if the risk of treating a specific lesion is high. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immature veins &ndash; Although it is recommended that all newly created AV fistulas should be evaluated at four to six weeks to identify and treat any problems interfering with development, it is very likely that immature veins are more susceptible to rupture. In this case, care should be taken not to be excessively aggressive. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Collateral veins &ndash; With the development of venous stenosis, collateral veins often form. At times, when use of the primary vein is not possible, a collateral may be used to restore access flow. Although this is a good approach to salvage the AV access, the collateral veins are fragile and susceptible to rupture. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oversized balloon &ndash; It is customary to use an oversized balloon for venous angioplasty; however, if the balloon is excessively oversized, rupture of the vein can be anticipated. When an elastic lesion is encountered, moving to an only slightly larger (1-mm increase) balloon is recommended. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive dilatation pressure &ndash; The recommendation for a resistant lesion is an increased level of dilatation pressure. As with the elastic lesion, this approach is important for success of the treatment, but it carries with it an increased risk of complication. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High intravascular pressure postangioplasty &ndash; There are instances in which an injured vessel might rupture due to excessive intravascular pressure. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If there is excessive downstream (proximal) resistance to flow, the weakened wall of the vein may give way. Avoidance of this situation is the reasoning behind treating the most centrally located lesion first when there are multiple stenotic lesions. This approach assures an unobstructed outflow. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An angioplasty site can rupture when performing a retrograde injection with the proximal access manually occluded. To reflux radiocontrast into the artery to obtain an arteriogram, the pressure exerted must exceed arterial pressure. The risk of rupture with a postangioplasty angiogram is particularly high following treatment of a juxta-anastomotic lesion. These angiograms should always be obtained by passing a vascular catheter slightly beyond the arterial anastomosis to avoid exposing the treated site to high intraluminal pressure. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Another situation is at least theoretically worth consideration. The vessel wall that is injured by the angioplasty is initially protected from the elevated pressure by the expanded balloon, but as the balloon starts to deflate, the injured wall becomes exposed and susceptible until the balloon deflates sufficiently to dissipate the excessive pressure. To prevent this phenomenon, manual occlusion of the inflow during the angioplasty procedure and until the balloon is totally deflated has been recommended. This prevents the sudden increase of pressure that would otherwise occur. Once the balloon is totally deflated, it is no longer obstructive (presumably) and the danger will have passed. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2873252961\"><span class=\"h2\">Postangioplasty angiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the venous lesions have been treated, it is important to leave the guidewire in place until the result of the angioplasty can be evaluated. If there is a complication, the presence of the guidewire may be essential for successful management. Following angioplasty, an angiogram should be performed to assess and document the result of therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F52331\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52331 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65660\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65660 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80782\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80782 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74325\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74325 \">image 3</a>) and identify the presence of any complications that might have occurred. Since some venous lesions are elastic and recoil after dilatation, it is advisable to wait 5 to 10 minutes after angioplasty to check the result of the treatment. It is very important that clinical or physiological abnormalities that were present prior to treatment be checked as early as practical following therapy. This should actually be regarded as the true gauge of success. These abnormalities should resolve after the procedure.</p><p>It is important to assess AV access inflow when assessing a dysfunctional graft. There are two easy and inexpensive ways to accomplish this: checking for pulse augmentation and visually assessing flow rate.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulse augmentation is perhaps the best method to use for AV access inflow assessment. It is performed by simply feeling the pulse within the AV fistula or AV graft (this works much better with the AV fistula), then completely occluding the graft and feeling by how much the pulse increases (augments). The degree of augmentation is directly proportional to the quality of the access inflow. Again, with experience, this becomes a useful tool for assessing AV access inflow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With experience, it is possible to assess the speed of blood flow within the graft (or fistula) by observing the speed of the movement of a puff of radiocontrast as it traverses the access. It is important that one observe both the front end (beginning) and the back end (ending) of a short bolus of radiocontrast. If either is not seen, one gets the impression that there is no movement. This is a subjective assessment, but with experience it becomes a valuable tool.</p><p/><p>If assessment of access inflow using these two methods suggests that it is not optimal, then a careful evaluation of the arterial anastomosis and feeding artery is indicated, although most interventionalists advocate assessing the inflow routinely in all cases. If an arterial inflow lesion is detected, it should be treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3134741700\"><span class=\"h2\">Balloon and sheath removal and hemostasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once inflated, an angioplasty balloon will be slightly larger than when it was inserted. It is often helpful to use a twisting motion to bring the balloon back into the sheath, a motion that wraps the &quot;wings&quot; of the deflated balloon back around the shaft. It may be best to remove the balloon and the sheath together rather than applying excessive force to pull the balloon into the sheath. This is particularly true with the removal of an angioplasty balloon that has ruptured. A broken fragment can catch on the sheath and be sheared off if excessive force is applied in balloon catheter removal.</p><p>Hemostasis can be obtained with manual pressure. However, special adhesive bandages are available that promote more rapid hemostasis. One such bandage (eg, TipStop) has a small plastic button covered with a layer of collagen in its center. The button applies pressure and the collagen promotes thrombosis. Another bandage (HemCon) contains chitosan (derived from shrimp shells), which provides rapid<em> </em>hemostasis<em>. </em>These bandages are relatively inexpensive and very effective in most cases. Using one of these devices, hemostasis can be accomplished within three to five minutes. Some interventionalists prefer to use a purse-string type of suture at the cannulation site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. If a suture is placed, provision must be made for removal within 24 to 48 hours; failure to do so can lead to skin necrosis, which increases the risk for infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H923232908\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCEDURE-RELATED COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with any type of medical procedure, angioplasty can result in procedure-related complications; however, the reported complication rate is overall low. In a report of 3560 cases of dialysis access arteriovenous (AV) graft angioplasty procedures performed by 29 interventional nephrologists in 11 different freestanding facilities, the overall complication rate was reported to be 1.15 percent; 1.04 percent were minor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p>Procedure-related complications are generally classified according to the reporting standards of the Society for Interventional Radiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. According to this standard, all complications, including pulmonary and cardiac events that occur within 30 days following the procedure, are considered procedure related. Minor complications are those that require either no therapy or only nominal therapy and resolve without any adverse sequelae. Major complications are defined as those that require an increase in the level of care or result in hospitalization, permanent adverse sequelae, or death. </p><p>Complications of angioplasty can be categorized related to vein spasm, vein rupture (eg, endothelial tear, extravasation, perigraft hematoma), or technical complications (eg, balloon rupture). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3777888550\"><span class=\"h2\">Vein spasm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vein spasm can occur following any instrumentation of a vein. This is generally of no consequence, but it can be confused for a stenotic lesion. Rarely, a patient may be encountered in whom it is a problem. Severe spasm can lead to thrombosis. To minimize the chances for venous spasm, it is important to use the least amount of instrumentation possible. Even the passage of a guidewire can precipitate spasm in susceptible patients. </p><p>Successful treatment for severe venospasm is challenging. Further instrumentation may make it worse. Intravenous nitroglycerine (100 micrograms) can be tried and has been reported to be beneficial. If this is not successful (the author has never had success with this) and there is concern that the flow is so affected that the access may thrombose, it may be prudent to systemically anticoagulate the patient with unfractionated intravenous heparin and wait it out. Spasm generally goes away over a one- to two-hour period, and often over a shorter period of time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H769593462\"><span class=\"h2\">Vein rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although injury to the vessel wall to some extent is important for successful angioplasty, at times the degree can be more than desired. This injury can take the form of a simple tear or an actual rupture with the extravasation of blood <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiocontrast into the surrounding tissue. It is difficult to predict the case in which vein rupture might occur. However, there are a few situations when the risk for rupture when treating a specific lesion is more than is acceptable. Measures to prevent vein rupture are discussed above.

Sometimes an endothelial tear will cause a flap that interferes with blood flow. These can generally be managed by placing the angioplasty balloon across the affected area, inflating it with a soft pressure, and leaving it for three to five minutes to tamponade the flap against the wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Although this is generally successful, the maneuver can be tried a second time if flow is still adversely affected. The placement of a stent should be considered after tamponade has failed a second time.

In a series of 5121 angioplasty procedures, vein rupture with extravasation to some degree comprised 70 percent of the complications, which occurred in 3.54 percent overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In another large study involving over 1200 cases, the reported incidences of vein rupture and extravasation were 0.9 and 2 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The clinical significance of vein rupture with extravasation is variable, ranging from none to disaster for the access. The difference lies in the severity of the tear. Vein rupture with extravasation becomes more obvious when there is the formation of an obvious hematoma. The amount of extravasated radiocontrast associated with the hematoma may be minimal or absent. In actuality, the size of the hematoma is not particularly important in determining the sequelae. One may see a small degree of extravasation with hematoma formation as a result of complete vein disruption that was quickly controlled. On the other hand, a very large hematoma may be completely stable and have no effect on blood flow. A classification system based upon its clinical significance is useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/11,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,54,55</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subclinical extravasation of radiocontrast &ndash; Blush of radiocontrast adjacent to vein</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 1 extravasation &ndash; Extravasation that is stable and does not affect blood flow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 2 extravasation &ndash; Extravasation that is stable but affects blood flow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 3 extravasation &ndash; Extravasation that is not stable, disruption of vein</p><p/><p>When an extravasation is noted, one must determine whether or not it is stable or continuing to enlarge, and whether or not it affects the flow of the AV access. As soon as it is obvious that a vascular rupture has occurred and a hematoma is forming, the access should be manually occluded upstream (distal) to the site of rupture to relieve pressure on the site and limit the degree of extravasation until a determination of its severity can be made. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H339289432\"><span class=\"h4\">Subclinical extravasation of radiocontrast</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, during the course of an angioplasty procedure, a blush of radiocontrast adjacent to the vein at the site of the dilation is observed, but there is no associated hematoma. This small extravasation is asymptomatic and only obvious on fluoroscopy. An ecchymosis may become apparent if it is superficial, but, regardless, no treatment is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

In general, a grade 1 extravasation that remains stable over 30 minutes to one hour will continue to behave in this manner as long as there is no downstream obstruction. Localized discomfort may be significant and may last for several days. Although it may cause concern on the part of the operator and the patient, it is of no real consequence with respect to the outcome of the procedure and requires no specific treatment or any ongoing observation, regardless of size; however, the patient may require symptomatic treatment measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Mild analgesics and a heating pad may be helpful. A grade 1 hematoma should be classified as a minor complication since no treatment is required and there is no adverse sequela.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4260071775\"><span class=\"h4\">Grade 2 extravasation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If an extravasation is stable but affects flow, it is classified as a grade 2 extravasation, regardless of size. Most of these lesions stabilize very quickly after they form. In these cases, the rupture that has been occurred will require treatment to restore AV access flow. The Grade 2 extravasation is classified as a major complication of AV access angioplasty even if treatment is successful since treatment was required. </p><p>Treatment of this lesion consists of angioplasty balloon tamponade for a period of four to five minutes. Once the balloon is in position, it should be inflated with a pressure that is only necessary to fully expand the balloon. The use of higher pressures could make the tear worse. The goal of treatment is to press the flap outward and compress the extravascular accumulation to open the lumen and restore flow. Once the lumen is opened with an angioplasty balloon, the sustained pressure of the balloon (tamponade) tends to stabilize the situation after a few minutes and allow for the restoration of flow. This return of flow helps to keep the offending flap in position. </p><p>If flow continues to be significantly affected after the tamponade procedure, the procedure should be repeated. If the problem continues, placement of a stent should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. If there is any downstream resistance (from a stenotic lesion that has not yet been treated, for example), this must be relieved. If the downstream intravascular resistance is greater than the resistance of the perivascular tissue, extravasation will continue. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4070432967\"><span class=\"h4\">Grade 3 extravasation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A grade 3 extravasation is an unstable extravasation with ongoing active bleeding. This is a result of a complete or near-complete disruption of the vein. Hematoma formation generally occurs very rapidly, but the size of the extravasation can be quite variable and primarily depends on how quickly it is recognized and controlled. The extravasation can become quite large if not recognized early, as in the case where the arm is covered by a drape. Balloon dilatation is somewhat painful; however, after the balloon is deflated the pain should disappear. If the patient continues to complain of pain, extravasation should be suspected. &#160; </p><p>When a grade 3 extravasation occurs, there is a real risk of losing the AV access. The first goal in the management of a grade 3 extravasation is to limit its size. As soon as the situation is recognized, the access inflow should be manually occluded to arrest further extravasation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Placement of a stent graft across the disruption should be attempted and is often successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/57,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,60</a>]. If it is not successful, the access should be occluded. To accomplish this, inflate an angioplasty balloon to a low pressure within the access below the site of rupture, typically overnight with the patient admitted to the hospital for observation. Once the access is thrombosed, the angioplasty balloon can be deflated and removed. Emergency surgery is not usually necessary; however, the patient will require a new dialysis access for both the immediate and long term. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1396936718\"><span class=\"h2\">Angioplasty balloon rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fortunately, when an angioplasty balloon &quot;ruptures,&quot; it does not explode; rather, the balloon is designed such that when the tolerance pressure of the balloon is exceeded, the attachment of the balloon to the catheter (weld-point) simply loosens, giving way and spilling the balloon's contents. If the structural integrity of the balloon material is actually disrupted, the balloon design is such that a linear tear should develop. Unfortunately, in spite of the precautions that have been taken in the manufacturing process, occasionally an angioplasty balloon does rupture with a circumferential tear, and if this occurs, there is the risk that a balloon fragment can embolize, which can occur at the time of rupture. A fragment of a ruptured balloon might also shear off when it is being extracted through the sheath. For this reason, any time that resistance occurs when a balloon is being removed, it is best to stop and remove the sheath along with the balloon as a unit.</p><p>Once a ruptured balloon has been extracted, it should be carefully examined to determine if a fragment has been left behind. When there is a circumferential tear and a fragment of the balloon has been left behind, in most cases, the fragment is still on the guidewire. For this reason, the guidewire should never be prematurely removed when there is a suspicion that a balloon fragment has been left behind. An angiogram can confirm that the fragment lies at some point along the course of the retained guidewire. A second guidewire should be passed and used to insert a snare, which can be used catch the distal end of the primary guidewire and extract it. With this task complete, the operator will have both ends of the guidewire in hand with the balloon fragment on the looped guidewire. At this point extraction is achieved by simply removing the guidewire along with the retained fragment. It may be necessary to remove the sheath as this is being done.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H754484821\"><span class=\"h1\">SUCCESS OF ANGIOPLASTY TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative <span class=\"nowrap\">(NKF-K/DOQI)</span> Practice Guideline 8.4 defines a successful angioplasty as a treatment resulting in less than 30 percent residual stenosis in which the <span class=\"nowrap\">clinical/physiological</span> parameters used to detect the stenosis return to acceptable limits<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The author does not agree with this definition. The goal of angioplasty should be no residual stenosis. Because not all reports have specified their particular criteria for success, it becomes necessary to evaluate each report individually and carefully to determine what is meant by their study author's usage of the term &quot;successful angioplasty.&quot;</p><p>Technical success rates for angioplasty vary according to the location of the lesion. Overall success rates can be misleading. The best approach is to look at individual lesion types. Two broad categories of venous lesions are seen, central vein stenosis and peripheral vein stenosis. Two special areas that should be evaluated separately are the venous anastomosis of an arteriovenous (AV) graft and lesions of the cephalic arch. These two areas are somewhat unique in their response to angioplasty.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2116470208\"><span class=\"h2\">Central vein stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reports of angioplasty treatment<strong> </strong>for central venous stenosis have demonstrated a variable technical success rate ranging from 70 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/2-7,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7,10,11</a>]. The primary and primary assisted patency rates for angioplasty treatment also have wide variability. The reported six-month primary patency rate has ranged from 23 to 63 percent with primary assisted patency rates of 29 percent to 100 percent. The 12-month primary patency rate ranges from 12 to 50 percent with a primary assisted patency rate of 13 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/1,25,62-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25,62-68</a>].</p><p>Lesions in the central veins tend to be elastic, and it has been speculated that there are both elastic and inelastic lesions based upon their response to angioplasty.

Of the 28 in whom angioplasty was successful, 21 (70 percent) had 50 percent or greater improvement in the luminal diameter of the lesion and 7 (23 percent) showed no improvement due to elasticity of the stenosis. Subsequently, 81 percent of successful (nonelastic) cases restenosed at an average of 7.6 months while 100 percent of elastic lesions were occluded in an average of 2.9 months. The authors of this study proposed stenting for the elastic lesions.</p><p>Most patients with an arteriovenous dialysis access have extremely large central veins. With central vein stenosis, the veins tend to be even larger. Based on angioplasty balloon sizes that are available, it is likely that the recommendation for oversizing the angioplasty balloon 20 to 30 percent is generally not possible. Thus, these lesions are often underdilated for this reason. Undersizing the angioplasty balloon frequently results in elastic recoil.</p><p>It is apparent that close surveillance with multiple repeated interventions is required to maintain patency and prevent occlusion over the long term for patients with central vein stenosis.

Blood flow through cephalic arch is generally higher for a brachial-cephalic compared with radial-cephalic AV fistula given that the flow rate of a brachial artery AV fistula is higher, in general, and all of the blood flow of a brachial-cephalic AV fistula goes through the cephalic arch, whereas in a radial-cephalic AV fistula there is the possibility for a division of blood flow to both the basilic and the cephalic vein. In some instances, all or the majority of flow actually misses the cephalic arch.</p><p>Angioplasty at this site is problematic. In a series of 1118<strong> </strong>procedures performed in AV fistulas and AV grafts, there were 74 upper arm AV fistulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Lesions resistant to angioplasty occurred in 4.8 percent of the upper arm AV fistulas, and the majority of these were within the cephalic arch. A venous rupture rate of 14.9 percent was observed in the upper arm, and, again, most were within the cephalic arch. </p><p>In another study of 50 percutaneous angioplasties in 26 AV fistulas with cephalic arch stenosis, anatomic success was 76 percent while clinical success was 98 percent. Higher inflation pressures (&gt;15 atm) were needed in 29 (58 percent) of the cases. Rupture occurred in 6 percent of cases (3 out of 50), one of which led to AV fistula loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The other two cases were salvaged with prolonged balloon inflation or stenting. Primary patency was 42 percent at six months and 23 percent at one year (median primary patency of five months). Primary assisted patency was 83 percent at six months and 75 percent at one year (median three years). An average of 1.6 procedures per year was required per AV fistula. This venous rupture requiring a therapy rate of 6 percent is placed into context when it is compared with a series of 1561 AV fistula angioplasties (all types) that reported a rupture rate of 0.23 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p>Long-term patency rates for cephalic arch angioplasty generally range from 41 to 76 percent at six months and 31 to 45 percent at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/1,2,11,49,50,78-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,11,49,50,78-80</a>]. The conclusion that one can draw from the available data concerning angioplasty of cephalic arch stenosis is that primary success is reasonably good. However, the lesion is more resistant to dilatation, is more likely to be associated with complications, and has a shortened long-term patency rate as compared with other sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/techniques-for-angioplasty-of-the-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1554344919\"><span class=\"h2\">AV graft arteriovenous anastomosis stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common site for the development of stenosis relating to an AV graft is the venous anastomosis.
