Both MPA and GPA are considered ANCA-associated vasculitides, although ANCA testing may be negative in some patients.</p><p>In the past, the term &quot;limited&quot; GPA was used to describe patients with clinical findings isolated to the upper respiratory tract or lungs, which occurs in approximately one-fourth of cases. The term was confusing, as &quot;limited&quot; disease could be severe. The current practice is to describe the locations of organ involvement and the severity of disease at each location. Thus, a patient can have &quot;severe&quot; disease in the lungs in the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with mild extrapulmonary involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-tract-involvement-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Microscopically, transmural infiltration of blood vessels with inflammatory cells is noted, associated with granulomatous inflammation in the surrounding tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-tract-involvement-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Necrosis of the vessel walls <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> necrosis of inflammatory cells within the vessel walls may be visible. One issue in the histopathologic diagnosis of GPA is that infections (typically granulomatous) can cause vascular inflammation within areas of diffusely inflamed parenchyma and must be differentiated from GPA. The presence of vasculitis in an area of otherwise uninvolved lung tissue ensures that the vascular inflammation is not just a consequence of another inflammatory process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-tract-involvement-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, this finding is infrequent and the diagnosis of GPA does not require it. A separate finding that favors GPA over infection is necrosis of the vascular media, which is rarely noted when vascular inflammation is caused by infection. Negative special stains and cultures are also evidence against an infectious etiology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The granulomatous inflammation of GPA is characterized by palisading histiocytes that are oriented with their long axis perpendicular to the necrotic center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-tract-involvement-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A few noncaseating granulomas may be present, but are not prominent. In general, the inflammatory changes associated with GPA are angiocentric, although a rare bronchocentric variant has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-tract-involvement-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The infiltrating inflammatory cells include neutrophils, lymphocytes, multinucleated giant cells, and eosinophils, but eosinophils are generally not abundant. However, eosinophilic variants of GPA have been described. In a case series of four patients with a clinical syndrome consistent with GPA, lung biopsy findings otherwise consistent with GPA were associated with eosinophil infiltration, but not peripheral eosinophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-tract-involvement-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

The results of initial testing, presence of extra-respiratory or co-morbid disease, and local expertise also influence the choice and order of procedures.

In general, biopsy confirmation of GPA or MPA is highly desirable, but individual patients may be deemed to be poor surgical candidates for lung biopsy.

A &quot;limited&quot; form, with clinical findings isolated to the upper respiratory tract or the lungs, occurs in approximately one-fourth of cases. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis#H182265351\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;, section on 'New terminology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is a necrotizing vasculitis without granulomatous inflammation that predominantly affects small vessels (ie, capillaries, venules, or arterioles) and can present with pulmonary capillaritis or interstitial lung disease. It can cause rhinosinusitis, but less commonly than GPA. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Lower respiratory tract'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Essentially all patients with GPA, either classic or limited, have upper airway or pulmonary involvement, and the majority of patients have both. Nonspecific complaints of fever, anorexia, weight loss, and malaise are often present. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common presenting symptoms and signs of GPA and MPA affecting the upper airway include nasal crusting, sinus pain, chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal obstruction, smell disturbances, <span class=\"nowrap\">purulent/bloody</span> nasal discharge, excessive tearing (ie, epiphora), and sinus mucocele formation. Chronic complications include nasal septal perforation, saddle nose deformity, hearing loss, subglottic stenosis, and tracheal collapse. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Nasal, sinus, and ear disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of pulmonary GPA and MPA include cough, hemoptysis (due to alveolar hemorrhage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tracheobronchial disease), dyspnea, and less commonly pleuritic pain. The severity of symptoms and signs varies considerably from asymptomatic (one-third of patients) to acute and fulminant alveolar hemorrhage with respiratory failure. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Lower respiratory tract'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) testing is performed in any adult patient with symptoms or signs suggestive of a vasculitis. More than 90 percent of patients with both lung and kidney involvement with active GPA or MPA have ANCAs in the serum, but the ANCA may be negative in limited GPA. In GPA, ANCAs are most commonly directed against serine protease 3 (PR3, or C-ANCA), but may be directed against myeloperoxidase (MPO, or P-ANCA). In MPA, ANCAs are usually directed to MPO. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-spectrum-of-antineutrophil-cytoplasmic-autoantibodies#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical spectrum of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies&quot;, section on 'Granulomatosis with polyangiitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiplanar computed tomography (MDCT) scanning is the preferred imaging modality for characterizing suspected rhinosinusitis in GPA or MPA. Typical findings include mucosal thickening or opacification in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Bony thickening or destruction of the sinus walls may be noted. MDCT of the larynx and trachea can help identify central airway lesions. (See <a href=\"#H89945589\" class=\"local\">'Sinus computed tomography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans of the chest are obtained in virtually all patients suspected of having GPA or MPA on the basis of their chest radiograph or their upper airway, renal or serologic findings. Common HRCT findings include multiple pulmonary nodules and patchy or diffuse areas of ground glass or consolidative opacities. Less common findings are a reticular pattern, interlobular septal thickening, honeycombing, bronchiectasis, pleural effusion, and hilar adenopathy. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of GPA or MPA is established when serologic testing (positive ANCA with autoantibodies to serine proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase) and histopathologic evidence of necrotizing vasculitis are present in a patient with a compatible clinical presentation. Use of medications that can cause drug-induced vasculitis must be excluded. The sequence and pace of the evaluation depends on the pattern of symptoms and acuity of illness. For all presentations, a prompt diagnosis allows the initiation of therapy that may be life-saving and organ sparing. (See <a href=\"#H90822002\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H175807358\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tissue confirmation of GPA or MPA is highly desirable, even among patients with a compatible clinical presentation and positive serology, due to the potential toxicity of treatment. The choice of a biopsy site must be individualized based on the accessibility of specific sites of disease and whether the patient would tolerate the planned procedure. (See <a href=\"#H90822002\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of GPA, MPA, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and central airway obstruction are discussed separately.
