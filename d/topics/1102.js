As an example, in the Monica-KORA study of 935 European adults aged 35 to 84 years, the prevalence of aortic sclerosis increased across the age distribution from 7 percent in those age 35 to 44 years to 65 percent in those age 75 to 84 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-sclerosis-and-pathogenesis-of-calcific-aortic-stenosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Calcification predominates in more advanced stages of aortic stenosis driving valve stiffness and narrowing. The pathobiology of calcific aortic valve disease is an area of active research, and our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of disease is in flux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-sclerosis-and-pathogenesis-of-calcific-aortic-stenosis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. </p><p>It is useful to consider it in two stages: the early initiation phase associated with aortic sclerosis and the later propagation phase associated with more advanced aortic stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-sclerosis-and-pathogenesis-of-calcific-aortic-stenosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The early initiation phase is characterized by three primary processes: lipid accumulation, inflammation, and calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-sclerosis-and-pathogenesis-of-calcific-aortic-stenosis/abstract/1,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17,18</a>], and demonstrates similarities to atherosclerosis. Indeed, the incidence of aortic stenosis is related to many of the same risk factors associated with atherosclerosis. By contrast, in the later stages of aortic stenosis (the propagation phase), clear differences with the pathology of atherosclerosis emerge, particularly with calcification predominating and driving progressive stiffness and narrowing of the valve. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3699023087\"><span class=\"h2\">Initiation phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The early phase of the disease, observed in patients with aortic sclerosis, is characterized by the following pathological findings: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal areas of accumulation of apolipoproteins B, (a), and E, consistent with accumulation of low density lipoprotein and lipoprotein(a) with evidence of lipoprotein oxidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-sclerosis-and-pathogenesis-of-calcific-aortic-stenosis/abstract/17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammation as evidenced by macrophage and T lymphocyte infiltration on histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-sclerosis-and-pathogenesis-of-calcific-aortic-stenosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>], inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-1-beta and transforming growth factor beta-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-sclerosis-and-pathogenesis-of-calcific-aortic-stenosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>], and increased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on positron emission tomography (PET) scanning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-sclerosis-and-pathogenesis-of-calcific-aortic-stenosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local production of proteins that promote tissue calcification, suggesting that valve calcification is actively regulated rather than being an unregulated degenerative process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-sclerosis-and-pathogenesis-of-calcific-aortic-stenosis/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>].

The threshold for diagnosis of aortic sclerosis was higher in this study than in the CHS study, and the population was younger, which could explain at least in part the lower rate of aortic sclerosis.

Other markers of mineral metabolism, including serum calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and 25 hydroxyvitamin D concentrations, were not associated with either aortic or mitral calcification. Similarly, among participants with chronic kidney disease in MESA, each 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> increase in serum phosphate within the normal range (2.5 to 4.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> was associated with 25 and 62 percent higher prevalences of aortic and mitral valve calcification, respectively, after adjustment for traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis, parathyroid hormone, and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-sclerosis-and-pathogenesis-of-calcific-aortic-stenosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

NOTCH1 transcripts are abundant in the developing aortic valve in mice and may promote valve calcification by diminishing the activity of Runx2, an important transcriptional regulator of the fate of osteoblast cells.

The accumulation of valve calcification appears related to the action of osteoblast-like cells and a range of pro-calcific mediators commonly associated with skeletal bone formation. Indeed, a histopathological study of 256 end-stage-excised calcified aortic valves demonstrated widespread evidence of active cartilage and bone formation, with 83 percent of valves showing regions of heterotopic ossification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-sclerosis-and-pathogenesis-of-calcific-aortic-stenosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

It is likely that the disease process is accelerated by abnormal shear or mechanical stress on the leaflet. This could explain why symptomatic calcification in patients with bicuspid aortic valves occurs about 10 years earlier than in patients with trileaflet valves. In most patients, a bicuspid aortic valve functions normally for many years. A subset of patients develop significant regurgitation, but most are asymptomatic until superimposed calcification results in obstruction to flow later in life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-bicuspid-aortic-valve-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of bicuspid aortic valve in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The likelihood of progression was assessed in a review of 2131 patients with aortic valve thickening detected on echocardiography: aortic stenosis developed in 338 (16 percent) after seven years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-sclerosis-and-pathogenesis-of-calcific-aortic-stenosis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. The stenosis was mild to moderate in 84 percent and severe in 16 percent. Only mitral annular calcification, a pathologic process similar to aortic valve sclerosis, was significantly associated with progression in multivariable analysis. As described in the next section, both aortic valve sclerosis and mitral annular calcification may also be predictors of cardiovascular events and mortality. A similar rate of progression to aortic stenosis was observed in the Cardiovascular Health Study cohort in which 9 percent of subjects with aortic sclerosis progressed to aortic stenosis in five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-sclerosis-and-pathogenesis-of-calcific-aortic-stenosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>Factors associated with progressive aortic valve calcification were identified in 5880 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-sclerosis-and-pathogenesis-of-calcific-aortic-stenosis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

Risk factors for incident aortic valve calcium included older age, male gender, a higher body mass index, current smoking, and the use of lipid-lowering and antihypertensive medications.

This in part may reflect the shared risk factors with atherosclerosis. However, even when these factors are taken into account, most studies have found that patients with aortic valve sclerosis still have an increased frequency of cardiovascular events and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-sclerosis-and-pathogenesis-of-calcific-aortic-stenosis/abstract/4,8,9,38,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,9,38,75</a>].

The all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the 29 percent of patients with aortic valve sclerosis were 22 and 10 percent, respectively. Compared with those with a normal valve, the adjusted relative risk of cardiovascular death and myocardial infarction in those with aortic sclerosis and no clinical evidence of coronary disease at baseline were 1.5 and 1.4, respectively.</p><p>An independent effect of aortic valve sclerosis on prognosis was also noted in an included report of 1980 elderly individuals (mean age 81 years) without valvular aortic stenosis, one-half of whom had aortic valve sclerosis identified by transthoracic echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-sclerosis-and-pathogenesis-of-calcific-aortic-stenosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. At four years, there were 830 new cardiac events (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction or sudden death). Aortic valve sclerosis was independently associated with new cardiac events (risk ratio 1.8) after adjusting for the fact that more patients with aortic valve sclerosis had pre-existing clinical coronary disease. </p><p>The mechanisms responsible for the association between aortic valve sclerosis and cardiovascular events and mortality are not well understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aortic-valve-sclerosis-and-pathogenesis-of-calcific-aortic-stenosis/abstract/1,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,76</a>].
