Over the past century, HL has been converted from a uniformly fatal disease to one that is curable in greater than 75 percent of patients worldwide. As a result, there are more than 30,000 long-term survivors of HL in the United States alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and many more throughout the world, a substantial percentage of whom will have the majority of their care delivered by primary care providers.

These complications have surfaced as significant causes of increased mortality among HL survivors. Screening for some of these entities is advised in the hope that early detection may lead to better management. </p><p>This topic review will provide an overview to the care of the classical HL survivor, focusing on issues that require attention at approximately one year from the completion of treatment onwards.

Pathologic staging used laparotomy and splenectomy to characterize abdominal involvement. In contrast, clinical staging uses imaging studies to define extent of disease.

Initial efforts were focused on cure, while subsequent efforts focused on decreasing short- and long-term toxicity while maintaining efficacy. The following describes general trends in HL treatment: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1960s and early 1970s &ndash; Patients underwent pathologic staging with laparotomy and splenectomy. Early-stage HL was treated with extended-field radiation therapy (mantle, para-aortic with or without pelvis) to doses of 40 to 44 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

With more effective and less toxic chemotherapy and with increasing documentation of serious late complications associated with extended-field radiation therapy, efforts were made to cut back on radiation therapy for HL. Combined modality therapy with ABVD-based chemotherapy, which eliminates the need for staging laparotomy and allows the use of more limited radiation treatment volumes and lower radiation doses, was shown to be associated with an improved disease-free and overall survival compared with extended-field radiation therapy alone in early-stage patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

Treatments have included staging laparotomy with splenectomy, limited or extensive field radiation, combination chemotherapy of varying types, or a combination of these. A subset of patients has been treated with high-dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell support (ie, autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation). These therapies place HL survivors at risk for the development of a diverse array of long-term sequelae, with the potential to negatively impact both their quality of life and ultimately, their survival. </p><p>The following sections describe the most common long-term complications associated with treatment.

Risk factors depend on the type of secondary malignancy being considered and include radiation dose and field, chemotherapy agents and doses administered, patient age at treatment, patient sex, and smoking history. Solid tumors account for the majority of second cancers in HL survivors, with breast, lung, and colon cancer being the most frequent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57099 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>].

The risk of acute leukemia peaks at five to nine years, while the solid tumor risk is less increased initially but progressively increases after 10 years. Acute leukemia is primarily a complication of chemotherapy, NHL appears to be unrelated to the type of therapy, and both lung and breast cancer are primarily related to radiation therapy, particularly mantle irradiation for breast cancer. Lung cancer rates are similar after radiation therapy alone or MOPP chemotherapy alone.

The raised risk of breast cancer occurs late, typically 10 or more years after first treatment. The three major risk factors for breast cancer are the age at treatment for HL, the use (and amount) of mantle radiotherapy, and the effect of alkylating and other agents on ovarian function.

The raised risk of lung cancer is seen from five to more than twenty years after initial treatment, with cases following chemotherapy usually occurring earlier than those following radiation. The risk is highest in patients treated with both chemotherapy (eg, alkylating agents) and radiation, especially among those patients who smoke.

This increased risk persists after 10 years, although at lower levels.

Survivors of HL are at risk for long-term CV complications related to the chemotherapy they have received (eg, anthracyclines) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation. One study estimated that, compared with community controls, survivors of pediatric HL aged 50 years will experience more than twice the number of CV conditions, nearly five times the number of more severe (grade 3 to 5) CV conditions and, on average, have one severe, life-threatening, or fatal CV condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Traditional cardiac risk factors, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking, further contribute to the risk of treatment-related cardiac disease after HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/38,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,48,49</a>]. These findings underscore the importance of screening for cardiac risk factors and aggressive management of these risk factors in survivors of HL. HL patients with preexisting cardiac disease are at especially high risk of cardiac morbidity requiring hospitalization after mediastinal irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p>Radiotherapy-related cardiac complications include pericardial disease, valvular dysfunction, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and coronary artery disease (CAD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Of these, CAD represents the most life-threatening form of cardiac complication. Compared with the normal population, HL survivors have demonstrated a three- to fivefold increased risk of CAD, with significant excesses first observed 10 years after treatment and persisting beyond 25 years after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/38,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,47,48</a>].

A high prevalence of valvular disease has also been observed, especially beyond 10 years after irradiation. As an example, in a prospective screening study on asymptomatic long-term survivors of HL, echocardiogram detected mild or greater aortic regurgitation in 4.5, 22, and 60 percent of patients 2 to 10, 11 to 20, and &gt;20 years after radiation therapy, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. </p><p>Most of the data on cardiac disease after HL relate to patients who have received mediastinal radiation therapy. The addition of doxorubicin-based chemotherapy (eg, ABVD) to radiation therapy further contributes to the risk of cardiac complications. A Canadian study examining cardiac hospitalization found an additive effect of chemotherapy to radiation on cardiac risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Initial studies also suggest an increased risk of cardiac mortality associated with doxorubicin-based therapy for HL in the absence of mediastinal irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/36,37,50,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37,50,53</a>]. However, studies to date are limited by small numbers of patients, short follow-up time, and competing lymphoma mortality, since patients given chemotherapy alone are more likely to have advanced-stage disease. As an example, a British study reported that, compared with the normal population, patients treated with ABVD without mediastinal radiation had a 7.8-fold increased risk of cardiac mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>Monitoring for cardiovascular disease is discussed below.

The absolute excess risk, however, is low, estimated at 0.1 percent per person per year, such that routine screening with Doppler is likely to be of low yield. In asymptomatic patients, there are no data to suggest that screening would be of benefit. However, careful auscultation for bruits as part of the physical examination with low threshold for referral for carotid ultrasound may be of benefit. Of note, the risk of non-coronary atherosclerotic disease after HL therapy is further increased in the presence of other traditional cardiac risk factors, again emphasizing the importance of lifestyle modifications in these patients to reduce the risk of late effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/49,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,56</a>].

Some studies have shown a correlation between fatigue level and cardiac disease, pulmonary dysfunction, and other late effects in HL survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/61,88,91,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,88,91,93</a>]. These findings suggest that in an otherwise healthy survivor, complaints of fatigue should initiate an investigation for potential underlying cardiopulmonary abnormalities. </p><p>Initial studies suggest that long-term survivors of childhood HL are at increased risk for neurocognitive impairment. In one study, neurocognitive testing was used to evaluate a cohort of 62 adult survivors of childhood HL randomly selected from a larger cohort of patients treated with either high-dose thoracic radiation or lower-dose thoracic radiation plus an anthracycline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. HL survivors demonstrated impairment in measures of sustained attention, short- and long-term recall, memory, and cognitive fluency. The pathophysiology driving these suspected neurocognitive changes in this population is unclear, but may be related to cerebrovascular pathology, which is related to impaired cardiopulmonary function. </p><p>HL survivors may also suffer from job discrimination, difficulty in obtaining health and life insurance, marital problems, and decreased sexual functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>]. Some of these difficulties may be related to treatment-associated long-term cosmetic changes (eg, scarring and permanent local hair loss) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].

Our approach to monitoring for recurrent disease is discussed separately. Relapsed disease can be suggested by changes on imaging studies but can only be confirmed by biopsy. As such, a biopsy should be obtained to document relapsed disease before proceeding to subsequent therapy.

For patients who have received total body or chest irradiation, breast cancer screening should begin eight years after radiation or at age 25 years, whichever occurs later. The type or combinations of types of screening modalities and time schedule may need to be tailored to individual patients depending on type of treatment, age at treatment, current age, and other breast cancer risk factors. Mammography can be used to screen most women for breast cancers, but women who received radiation to the chest during childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood (eg, between ages 10 and 35 years) should be considered for screening with both annual breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mammography. There are no data on the role of chemoprevention specific to female HL survivors. However, selected female HL survivors may benefit from a consultation with a high-risk breast specialist to discuss chemoprevention options.

Accordingly, clinicians should consider starting colorectal screening in such long-term HL survivors at least 10 years earlier than would be recommended for the general population.

As an example, in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), which included 1927 survivors of pediatric HL followed for a median of 23 years, HL survivors had an estimated cumulative incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancers of approximately 20 percent at 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. All patients should be encouraged to minimize lifelong sun exposure and to use ultraviolet light-blocking agents. They should be counseled about self-skin examination and advised to examine their skin regularly and notify their physicians if moles change. In addition, they should have a regular full-body skin examination by a clinician with skin expertise.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1065750\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiovascular health</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening and counseling techniques similar to those used for other high-risk populations are applied to HL survivors with the goal of decreasing mortality from cardiovascular disease. Our approach is generally consistent with those proposed by the NCCN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and the Children&rsquo;s Oncology Group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. </p><p>Cardiac risk factors should be minimized (eg, smoking, obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension). Routine care should incorporate regular measurement and control of blood pressure, auscultation of the carotids for bruits, heart murmurs, nutritional counseling and obesity control, counseling for smoking cessation, and control of diabetes and lipids. For this at-risk population, an LDL of 100 or lower is typically targeted. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, we commonly refer HL survivors to a cardiologist for baseline evaluation after the completion of treatment and determination of the necessity and frequency of additional screening or diagnostic studies (eg, resting and stress echocardiogram).

Physicians must be aware of HL survivors&rsquo; treatment history; additional testing should be pursued if suspicion of a late complication arises. </p><p/><p>The largest prospective cardiac screening study was conducted by the Stanford group using resting echocardiography, stress echocardiography, and nuclear scintigraphy on 294 asymptomatic HL survivors with history of chest irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Echocardiography detected mild or greater aortic regurgitation in 4.5, 22, and 60 percent of patients 2 to 10, 11 to 20, and &gt;20 years after therapy, respectively. Further, only 6.3 percent of cases were detectable by auscultation. There was a two- to threefold risk of diastolic dysfunction after 10 years, which was significantly associated with subclinical coronary disease, and to subsequently develop cardiac events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].

A total of nine patients required either percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary artery bypass graft based on angiography findings. These results support the use of diagnostic studies to screen HL survivors beginning 10 years after the completion of chest irradiation. The role of these screening tests in patients who have not received radiation is not clear. (See <a href=\"#H11941396\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11941404\" class=\"local\">'Non-coronary atherosclerotic disease'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1065758\"><span class=\"h3\">Endocrine assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the known contribution of traditional cardiac risk factors such as diabetes to the long-term risk of cardiac disease, as well as the association between abdominal doses of &gt;36 Gy and the risk of developing diabetes, the Children&rsquo;s Oncology Group recommends fasting glucose or hemoglobin A1c every two years in survivors who had received chest or abdominal irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. HL survivors whose treatment included radiation to the neck or mediastinum should have an assay of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) measured one year after the completion of therapy and then annually. If the serum TSH concentration is elevated, the TSH measurement should be repeated along with a serum free T4 to make the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Assays can be performed earlier if clinical suspicion exists, but the clinician must be aware of the possibility of acquired transient central hypothyroidism (the sick-euthyroid syndrome) early after radiation treatment.

Increased efforts may be needed to reach out to and educate survivors of lower socioeconomic status. This was suggested in a questionnaire study on long-term HL survivors that reported that a lower socioeconomic status was associated with poorer adherence to routine health care and a higher likelihood of engaging in unhealthy habits, including physical inactivity, smoking, and <span class=\"nowrap\">moderate/heavy</span> alcohol use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>].</p><p>The cardiovascular sequelae of HL treatment can be mitigated through active lifestyle modifications. Reducing or eliminating comorbid conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, is important. Smokers should be encouraged to quit to reduce the risk of cardiac disease, improve lung function, and decrease the risk of lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/28,48,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,48,62</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Engaging in regular physical activity may be particularly critical in helping HL survivors to be healthy. Physical inactivity is designated by the American Heart Association as one of the major risk factors for coronary heart disease. In addition to reducing risk of heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>], exercise may potentially help with fatigue, a common long-term problem in HL survivors. In a pilot study assessing the feasibility of an exercise program in HL survivors with chronic fatigue, it was noted that the fatigue, physical functioning, and maximal aerobic capacity were significantly improved after a home-based exercise intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. Therefore, all HL survivors should be encouraged to participate in at least some exercise, with patients informed that the more exercise they get, the better chance they have of improving their quality of life (QOL). Consultation with exercise physiologists and nutritionists may be appropriate in select patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23221326\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pregnancy rate among premenopausal Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors approaches that of the normal female population (85 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

Follow-up imaging should be performed before conception but not during pregnancy unless indicated by physical findings or symptoms. The patient should be evaluated for infertility if she does not become pregnant within one year. For women older than age 35, fertility work-up is indicated if pregnancy does not occur within six months. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pregnancy does not appear to increase the risk of recurrence among HL survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>] and does not alter the surveillance recommendations. However, as with all HL survivors, women should be monitored during pregnancy for any unusual signs or symptoms and evaluated accordingly.

Most patients enjoy a high cure rate, and the serious complications are often much delayed, occurring decades after treatment. Typically, the medical oncologist follows the patient closely for several years after finishing therapy, and subsequently, the patient transitions back to the primary care physician (PCP) as his or her main provider. This transition period can be fraught with miscommunication between even the most well-meaning providers. Establishing a survivorship care plan is one way to facilitate communication and allocation of responsibility during this time period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. Regular communications between PCPs and oncologists regarding follow-up and screening recommendations and management of late complications that arise over time would further promote optimal care for HL survivors. The patient&rsquo;s attendance of a survivorship clinic, where available, can also aid in promoting well-coordinated care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cancer-survivorship-care-for-primary-care-and-oncology-providers#H418030689\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cancer survivorship care for primary care and oncology providers&quot;, section on 'Coordination of care'</a>.)</p><p>With the young median age at diagnosis, patients with HL tend to be highly mobile. It can be logistically difficult for survivors who no longer live locally to return to their oncology center for regular follow-up visits. Long-term survivors of HL, many of whom are relatively young and asymptomatic, may also be less motivated to maintain contact with their oncologists. Studies have suggested a benefit for long-term survivors to receive follow-up care from oncologists. Such clinicians would be expected to have more experience in addressing late effects of cancer therapy and be more familiar with key health issues in this population. In a study conducted by the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) group on young adult survivors of pediatric cancers, 87 percent of the survivors reported general medical contact, but only 19 percent reported visits to a cancer center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In a subsequent analysis from the same group, survivors who received care in a cancer<sup> </sup>center were more likely than those who received their care elsewhere<sup> </sup>to report an indicated echocardiogram (53 versus 22 percent) or mammogram<sup> </sup>(62 versus 35 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. In another study, HL survivors who had received information from an oncologist were significantly more likely to correctly assess their breast cancer risk than those who received information from other sources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. </p><p>However, continued follow-up care at cancer centers can be challenging as survivors move to new places, and it can also be restricted by limited oncology clinic schedule and space. Survivors can be encouraged to take a more active role in their follow-up care, and this can be facilitated by providing patients with information of their treatment history and educating patients regarding the potential late complications and the importance of adherence to screening practice and risk-reducing behavioral modification. </p><p>Through a deepened understanding of late treatment effects, we can begin to more effectively counsel our patients on the risks they face and the lifestyle modifications and other interventions that can reduce the ill effects of these complications. Effectively managing these consequences of therapy may improve the quality of life of HL survivors and has the potential to prolong their survival. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105459257\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are a growing number of long-term survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). These patients must be monitored periodically not only for disease recurrence, but also for long-term complications related to the disease and its treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F85763\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85763 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11941468\" class=\"local\">'Posttreatment surveillance'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of developing both hematologic and solid tumor second malignancies is increased in long-term survivors of HL and likely differs depending upon the age at treatment and the treatment received. Solid tumors account for the majority of second cancers in HL survivors, with breast, lung, and colon cancer being the most frequent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57099 \">table 3</a>). Female HL survivors should undergo screening for breast cancer beginning no later than age 40 years. For patients who have received total body or chest irradiation, breast cancer screening should begin eight years after radiation or at age 25 years, whichever occurs later. Mammography can be used to screen most women for breast cancers, but women who received radiation to the chest during childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood (eg, between ages 10 and 35 years) should be considered for screening with both annual breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mammography. (See <a href=\"#H11941388\" class=\"local\">'Second malignancy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1065733\" class=\"local\">'Cancer screening'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survivors of HL are at risk for long-term cardiovascular complications (eg, congestive heart failure, stroke) related to the chemotherapy they have received (eg, anthracyclines) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation. Risk factors include preexisting hypertension, young age at HL diagnosis, and the amount of radiotherapy received. (See <a href=\"#H11941396\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11941404\" class=\"local\">'Non-coronary atherosclerotic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytotoxic agents and radiation therapy can produce gonadal dysfunction in both male and female survivors of HL. Infertility is relatively uncommon among younger patients treated with ABVD. Infertility rates are higher among older patients and those receiving BEACOPP or high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation. Survivors who received neck <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mediastinal radiation are at risk for developing hypothyroidism. (See <a href=\"#H11941420\" class=\"local\">'Infertility and endocrine dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pregnancy rate among premenopausal HL survivors approaches that of the normal female population. It is generally recommended that women delay pregnancy for at least two years after treatment has been completed. HL survivors who become pregnant should have a physical examination specifically focused to evaluate for signs and symptoms of recurrent HL at least once during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H23221340\" class=\"local\">'Counseling'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lifestyle modification, including regular exercise, smoking cessation, and a healthy diet are all important in minimizing the severity of late treatment sequelae. (See <a href=\"#H1064521\" class=\"local\">'Lifestyle modifications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coordination of care among the medical oncologist, primary care physician, and other healthcare professionals is critical and can be facilitated by the patient&rsquo;s participation in a survivorship clinic, where available. (See <a href=\"#H11941484\" class=\"local\">'Coordination of care'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-approach-to-the-adult-survivor-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Jemal A, Siegel R, Ward E, et al.
