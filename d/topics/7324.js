Worldwide, FU is the third most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent used to treat solid malignancies, including those arising in the head and neck, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, anus, and breast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoropyrimidine-associated-cardiotoxicity-incidence-clinical-manifestations-mechanisms-and-management/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In addition, fluoropyrimidines are frequently used concurrently with external beam radiation therapy because of their radiosensitizing properties. Fluoropyrimidines also possess a number of important toxicities, which vary according to dose and schedule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoropyrimidine-associated-cardiotoxicity-incidence-clinical-manifestations-mechanisms-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

At present, FU is the second most common chemotherapeutic agent associated with cardiotoxicity, after anthracyclines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoropyrimidine-associated-cardiotoxicity-incidence-clinical-manifestations-mechanisms-and-management/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Despite this, fluoropyrimidine-associated cardiotoxicity remains a poorly defined entity, particularly in regards to the underlying mechanism and optimal management. The most common clinical manifestation is angina but myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, heart failure, acute pulmonary edema, cardiac arrest, pericarditis, and asymptomatic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes are all reported. As with the other fluoropyrimidine-related toxicities, the incidence varies according to the schedule and route of administration.</p><p>Recognition of fluoropyrimidine cardiotoxicity is clinically important. Repeated administration may lead to potentially avoidable permanent damage and even death. On the other hand, premature cessation of effective chemotherapy because of unrelated cardiac events may reduce chemotherapy effectiveness and may even compromise cancer cure.</p><p>This topic will cover the incidence, clinical manifestations, mechanisms, and management of cardiotoxicity related to fluoropyrimidine therapy. Cardiotoxicity related to anthracyclines and other non-anthracycline anticancer agents is presented elsewhere.

The variability in incidence rates may be due in part to differences in the definition of cardiotoxicity, but risk estimates may also be influenced by the method of FU administration, the presence of underlying coronary artery disease (CAD), the use of concurrent radiation therapy (RT) or anthracyclines, and how intensively patients were monitored. </p><p>The highest rates of cardiotoxicity have been observed in carefully monitored patients, as reflected by the following reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study evaluated 102 consecutive patients receiving FU, all of whom were monitored using 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography, and radionuclide ventriculography prior to the first cycle and continuous Holter monitoring during the FU infusion; the same examinations were repeated three months later after the discontinuation of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoropyrimidine-associated-cardiotoxicity-incidence-clinical-manifestations-mechanisms-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

However, as FU is rapidly cleared from the bloodstream after bolus administration with a half-life of 15 to 20 minutes, a direct effect of the drug seems unlikely to be the cause of cardiotoxicity.

The lack of reported cardiac toxicity from fluoropyrimidines administered with the dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme inhibitors eniluracil and gimeracil lends further support to the possibility that metabolic pathways leading to FBAL generation may be a significant pathophysiologic component of cardiotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoropyrimidine-associated-cardiotoxicity-incidence-clinical-manifestations-mechanisms-and-management/abstract/80-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">80-82</a>].

Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is an alternative for patients deemed to be at low risk for native coronary artery disease (CAD).</p><p>Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities lack sensitivity for the diagnosis of fluoropyrimidine-induced cardiac ischemia. In a systematic review of published studies addressing the incidence, manifestations, and predisposing factors for fluoropyrimidine cardiotoxicity, new onset ECG changes were present on single ECG acquisition in 6 to 33 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoropyrimidine-associated-cardiotoxicity-incidence-clinical-manifestations-mechanisms-and-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

If the coronary arteries are normal (or if the extent of CAD is thought not to be clinically significant), a presumptive diagnosis of fluoropyrimidine cardiotoxicity can be made. Issues related to management of antineoplastic therapy in these cases are discussed below.

In appropriately selected patients, CCTA has a strong negative predictive value (&ge;95 percent) for excluding the likelihood of major adverse cardiac events. Indications and limitations of CCTA (which include the potential for significant radiation exposure) are discussed in detail elsewhere. If the study is positive, diagnostic coronary angiography is indicated.

These tests should not be considered a valid evaluation for the presence of fluoropyrimidine-induced cardiotoxicity.</p><p>An important point is that the presence of significant CAD at the time of cardiac catheterization does not eliminate the possibility that the fluoropyrimidine contributed to the chest pain. For patients in whom continued fluoropyrimidine therapy is preferred over a switch to a non-fluoropyrimidine-based regimen, revascularization according to standard guidelines is a reasonable approach, followed by a reattempt to administer the fluoropyrimidine, preferably with close monitoring. This approach may improve the patients' overall prognosis by increasing their ability to tolerate therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoropyrimidine-associated-cardiotoxicity-incidence-clinical-manifestations-mechanisms-and-management/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. If chest pain once again develops, then the presumptive diagnosis of fluoropyrimidine cardiotoxicity can be made.</p><p>The more difficult cases are those where non-critical or non-significant CAD (eg, 50 percent stenosis) is identified, and the decision as to the attribution of chest pain in these cases may be difficult. Provocative tests (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ergonovine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ergonovine</a>, acetylcholine, and hyperventilation) have been performed in the catheterization laboratory in an attempt to confirm the diagnosis. However, at present, the issue of provocative testing is extremely controversial. Guidelines on invasive <span class=\"nowrap\">testing/coronary</span> angiography from the <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> do not specifically address this subject [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoropyrimidine-associated-cardiotoxicity-incidence-clinical-manifestations-mechanisms-and-management/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. A more recent <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> statement did address provocative testing, but assigned it only a class IIB recommendation (benefit &ge; risk, with additional studies needed) and a level of evidence of only &quot;C,&quot; and even then, only for those patients with no significant angiographic CAD and no documentation of transient ST-segment elevation when clinically relevant symptoms possibly explained by coronary artery spasm are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoropyrimidine-associated-cardiotoxicity-incidence-clinical-manifestations-mechanisms-and-management/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. The lack of mention of coronary provocation testing in these guidelines has been noted, and although pharmacologic provocation testing is not frequently performed, some authors emphasize its safety, with comparable results when using ergonovine or acetylcholine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoropyrimidine-associated-cardiotoxicity-incidence-clinical-manifestations-mechanisms-and-management/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>]. The <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> statement does note that a higher level of expertise and careful monitoring are needed when provocation testing is performed, and this should only be done by expert groups. In our view, provocative testing is indicated for suitable patients as long as the requisite expertise is available in the catheterization laboratory.

Recognition of fluoropyrimidine cardiotoxicity is clinically important. Continued administration may lead to potentially avoidable permanent damage and even death. On the other hand, premature cessation of effective chemotherapy because of unrelated cardiac events may compromise cancer cure.

(See <a href=\"#H40210401\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluoropyrimidine treatment should be immediately discontinued if symptoms develop suggestive of cardiotoxicity. Cardiac symptoms usually resolve with termination of FU treatment and antianginal treatment (eg, topical nitrates, calcium channel blockers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoropyrimidine-associated-cardiotoxicity-incidence-clinical-manifestations-mechanisms-and-management/abstract/8,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,34</a>], and the cardiotoxicity appears to be completely reversible after cessation of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H40025269\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The next step is to establish whether the cardiac symptoms can reasonably be attributed to the fluoropyrimidine. Unfortunately, there is no test to definitively establish the diagnosis of fluoropyrimidine-induced cardiotoxicity. (See <a href=\"#H1933239221\" class=\"local\">'Establishing the diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For most patients with suspected fluoropyrimidine-induced chest pain in whom continued treatment with a fluoropyrimidine is thought to be preferable over a change to a non-fluoropyrimidine-containing regimen, diagnostic coronary arteriography is indicated to exclude another concomitant process that could account for an acute coronary syndrome presentation and to guide treatment decisions. For patients undergoing diagnostic coronary arteriography, provocative testing is indicated for suitable patients as long as the requisite expertise is available in the catheterization laboratory. Coronary computed tomography angiography is a reasonable alternative to coronary arteriography for patients deemed to be at low risk for native coronary artery disease (CAD). (See <a href=\"#H397100413\" class=\"local\">'Presentation with chest pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who present with heart failure or arrhythmias, the temporal association with drug administration and a lack of prior history of heart failure or arrhythmias are key to distinguishing these symptoms as potentially related to the fluoropyrimidine. Both global and segmental dysfunction have been described, as has the particular segmental dysfunction pattern of stress-induced (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy (or apical ballooning syndrome). In most cases, discontinuation of the fluoropyrimidine is followed by prompt improvement in left ventricular function and resolution of the arrhythmia. (See <a href=\"#H348907789\" class=\"local\">'Other presentations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of antineoplastic therapy in patients with presumed fluoropyrimidine cardiotoxicity depends on a number of factors, including the intent of therapy (ie, curative versus palliative), the availability of effective alternative non-fluoropyrimidine-containing regimens, and geographic location. (See <a href=\"#H3768167735\" class=\"local\">'Other oral fluoropyrimidines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, rechallenge with FU or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> is not recommended for most patients. Recurrence rates are as high as 90 percent in several small series, and fatalities are reported. Prophylactic strategies using nitrates or calcium channel blockers are not uniformly effective. The decision to rechallenge must include a careful weighing of the risks against the possible benefits of retreatment in each individual patient. Rechallenge may reasonably considered in the following scenarios:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who present with fluoropyrimidine-induced chest pain, are found to have significant CAD on diagnostic coronary angiography, and undergo revascularization in an attempt to improve the ability to tolerate therapy, rechallenge could reasonably be attempted if the benefits of drug continuation are felt to outweigh the risks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For other highly selected patients with no significant CAD for whom there are no other reasonable therapeutic alternatives and in whom the risk to benefit ratio of continuing the fluoropyrimidine is thought to favor significant benefit, rechallenge (preferably with bolus rather than infusional FU) can be attempted. (See <a href=\"#H2926916182\" class=\"local\">'Change treatment schedule'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If rechallenge is attempted, patients should be treated with aggressive prophylaxis (pretreatment for at least 48 hours using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and both a calcium channel blocker [eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> starting at 90 mg twice daily and titrated to 180 mg twice daily if tolerated] and scheduled long-acting nitrates [eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isosorbide-dinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isosorbide dinitrate</a> uptitrated to the highest possible dose based upon blood pressure]), detailed informed consent, careful observation on an inpatient unit with continuous ECG monitoring, and immediate discontinuation of FU administration if any symptoms or signs of a cardiac event occur. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with metastatic disease treated with palliative intent, the preferred strategy in most cases is to switch to a non-fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy regimen or a different treatment modality. (See <a href=\"#H40210463\" class=\"local\">'Other treatment options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Management of patients treated in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting is more challenging, and decisions must be individualized. Decision-making is especially difficult for patients being treated in the adjuvant setting for colorectal cancer (see <a href=\"#H3059964031\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant therapy colorectal cancer'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Where available, treatment with the oral thymidylate synthesis inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raltitrexed-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raltitrexed</a> carries with it minimal cardiotoxicity risk, but there are case reports of fatalities when raltitrexed is administered to patients with fluoropyrimidine-induced cardiotoxicity. It must be used cautiously. (See <a href=\"#H324782781\" class=\"local\">'Switch to a non-fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>UFT and S-1 are oral FU prodrugs in combination with a dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) inhibitor, and there is a lower intrinsic risk of cardiotoxicity, especially with S-1. Where available, these agents are a reasonable substitute for FU and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a>, although experience in patients who have fluoropyrimidine-related cardiotoxicity is limited to case reports and small series. (See <a href=\"#H3768167735\" class=\"local\">'Other oral fluoropyrimidines'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3059964031\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant therapy colorectal cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients treated in the United States, where none of these three drugs are available, the best approach is uncertain. One option is challenge with an FU bolus-containing regimen, such as the Roswell Park weekly regimen of leucovorin-modulated FU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoropyrimidine-associated-cardiotoxicity-incidence-clinical-manifestations-mechanisms-and-management/abstract/136,137\" class=\"abstract_t\">136,137</a>] or, for patients who need <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a>, FLOX (FU plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> and oxaliplatin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoropyrimidine-associated-cardiotoxicity-incidence-clinical-manifestations-mechanisms-and-management/abstract/137\" class=\"abstract_t\">137</a>]. However, if this approach is attempted, patients should be treated with aggressive prophylaxis (pretreatment for at least 48 hours using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and both a calcium channel blocker [eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> starting at 90 mg twice daily and titrated to 180 mg twice daily if tolerated] and scheduled long-acting nitrates [eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isosorbide-dinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isosorbide dinitrate</a> uptitrated to the highest possible dose based upon blood pressure]), detailed informed consent, careful observation on an inpatient unit with continuous ECG monitoring, and immediate discontinuation of FU administration if any symptoms or signs of a cardiac event occur. </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fluoropyrimidine-associated-cardiotoxicity-incidence-clinical-manifestations-mechanisms-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Myers CE.
