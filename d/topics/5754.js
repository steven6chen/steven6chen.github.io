Among 1427 patients who underwent CABG, the five-year mortality rate was higher when a new Q wave developed (8.2 versus 3.7 percent for no new ECG changes, adjusted relative risk 2.6). There was no increase in mortality associated with other new ECG changes (ST segment elevation or depression or T wave abnormalities). In contrast to the above report from CASS, the mortality risk increased with time after discharge from the hospital.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Elevated biochemical markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Perioperative MI'</a> above), elevations in serum biomarkers of myocardial necrosis (creatine kinase MB fraction [CK-MB] and troponin) are necessary for the diagnosis of perioperative MI. However, the significance of elevations in these biomarkers is made difficult due to their release as a routine sequela of CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-11</a>]. An increase in serum CK-MB above the upper limit of normal has been noted in 62 to 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

The relationship between myocardial enzyme elevation and survival following CABG was best evaluated in a study of nearly 19,000 patients enrolled in seven randomized trials or registries with follow-up between three months and five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. For both troponin and CK-MB, 30-day mortality increased significantly as the ratio of the value of the biomarker compared to the upper limit of normal for that biomarker increased. For example, the relative risk of death was 1.00, 1.89, 2.22, 3.61, and 10.91 for troponin ratios of 6 to &lt;10, 10 to &lt;20, 20 to &lt;40, 40 to &lt;100, and &ge;100, respectively. Similar findings were noted at one year.</p><p>These marked elevations in serum biomarkers of myocardial necrosis are thought to result from early graft failure, inadequate myocardial protection during bypass, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> distal embolization of plaque material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Elevated serum troponins may be more specific and sensitive markers than CK-MB of a new MI after CABG, and may be more predictive of early complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. This issue was addressed in a report of 224 patients in whom serum troponin T and CK-MB were measured every eight hours after cardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a multivariable analysis, serum troponin T concentrations &ge;1.58 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (which represented the upper quintile) were the strongest predictor of postoperative death or shock immediately postoperatively or at 18 to 24 hours. Serum CK-MB did not have independent prognostic importance when troponin T was measured. Long-term data were not provided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Early graft occlusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early (within the first 30 days after surgery) occlusion occurs in approximately 5 to 10 percent of saphenous vein grafts. These occlusions are usually thrombotic and are generally related to technical problems at the anastomosis; injury related to manipulation during harvesting may also be important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The risk of early graft occlusion appears to be reduced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> therapy, which is typically restarted within six hours after surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-therapy-to-prevent-complications-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical therapy to prevent complications after coronary artery bypass graft surgery&quot;, section on 'Aspirin'</a>.)</p><p>Approximately 3 to 6 percent of patients develop clinically apparent postoperative ischemia as manifested by ischemic symptoms, significant ischemic ECG abnormalities, hemodynamic instability, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ventricular arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p>In two series of patients undergoing urgent postoperative angiography for recurrent ischemia, SVG occlusion or stenosis occurred in 37 to 56 percent and internal mammary graft occlusion or stenosis in 12 to 29 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In one of these studies, 131 of 2052 patients (6.4 percent) undergoing CABG met one or more of the criteria for ischemia at a median of 12 hours (range 0.5 to 96 hours) after CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Angiography was performed in 108, while 23 went immediately to surgery because of severe hemodynamic compromise. Angiography revealed normal grafts in 45, saphenous vein or internal mammary artery graft occlusion in 41, incorrect anastomosis in 29, graft stenosis in 14, graft spasm or a displaced graft in six each, poor distal runoff in five, and incomplete revascularization in two.</p><p>Revascularization is generally attempted if the anatomy is appropriate. In a study in which repeat CABG was evaluated, 16 of 43 patients who underwent acute angiography were not revascularized because it was not necessary or not feasible due to poor vessel quality or nonavailability of graft material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The optimal revascularization strategy for early graft occlusion is not known.

In a series of 10 patients undergoing urgent PCI (mostly saphenous vein graft [SVG] lesions, six fixed with a drug-eluting stent), significant periprocedural complications occurred in four [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. There were three perforations (one during stenting of a distal vein graft anastomosis, one during high-pressure balloon angioplasty of an internal mammary graft distal anastomosis, and one during PCI of a native artery total occlusion). Acute thrombosis of a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> stent occurred in a fourth patient, who was not loaded with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>. Major bleeding complications occurred in four patients, including two with cardiac tamponade, one with gastrointestinal bleeding, and one with excessive chest tube drainage.</p><p/><p>The authors concluded that the safety of drug-eluting stents was uncertain in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This is a particular concern in patients at high risk for perioperative bleeding, since the need to discontinue antiplatelet therapy increases the risk of stent thrombosis. The balance between stent thrombosis and major bleeding is especially critical in the early postoperative period.

When the lesion is in an SVG, use of a distal embolic protection device was recommended, if feasible. This approach was not changed in the 2011 American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">Foundation/AHA/SCAI</span> focused update [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. </p><p>It is our practice to recommend emergent cardiac catheterization for patients developing acute ischemia soon after CABG. Percutaneous revascularization is performed when feasible and if at least a moderate amount of myocardium is jeopardized. We believe this offers advantages over early reoperation in many patients. Caution is required during treatment of fresh anastomoses and the operator should be prepared to treat possible perforations, including the placement of covered stents if needed.</p><p>We generally attempt low pressure balloon angioplasty for early treatment of distal anastomoses with stenting used only if the result is suboptimal. In comparison, for severely thrombotic grafts, we frequently attempt revascularization of the native vessel with drug-eluting stents. If stents are to be employed, we proceed with usual measures for the prevention of thrombosis, including glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> inhibitors and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> loading, and are prepared to treat bleeding complications if needed.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-and-flutter-after-cardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation and flutter after cardiac surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Ventricular tachyarrhythmias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular tachyarrhythmias associated with CABG have a variable effect on prognosis. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) occurs in 17 to 97 percent of patients and is thought to be reperfusion-induced; it is typically benign, although some patients may be at increased risk of future life-threatening arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>].</p><p>Sustained monomorphic or polymorphic VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) occur in approximately 1 to 3 percent of patients, usually within the first week after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/32,34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,34-38</a>]. In two reports including a total of 9159 patients, 114 (1.2 percent) with VT or VF, predictors of perioperative ventricular arrhythmias included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/35,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,38</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &lt;65 years</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body mass index &lt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unstable angina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ejection fraction &le;50 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary or systemic hypertension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Requirement for inotropes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an intraaortic balloon pump</p><p/><p>Patients with perioperative VT or VF, compared to those without these arrhythmias, had a significant increase in postoperative mortality (24.6 versus 1.5 percent). In one of the reports, intraoperative VT or VF had a greater impact on mortality than postoperative arrhythmia (42 versus 18 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Polymorphic VT is typically associated with perioperative MI, combined with multiple risk factors that are present in the perioperative period such as hemodynamic instability, increased sympathetic activity, and metabolic abnormalities. In comparison, sustained monomorphic VT is most likely in patients with a history of a prior MI, heart failure, and depressed left ventricular function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. When all three of these factors are present, the risk of VT in one report was 30 percent, a 14-fold increase compared to the absence of all three risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. An additional factor may be the placement of grafts across a noncollateralized occlusion in a vessel supplying an infarct zone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], suggesting that reperfusion may restore electrical function, creating reentrant circuits, in a previously quiescent region of myocardium.</p><p>Magnesium supplementation may reduce the incidence of postoperative ventricular arrhythmias. In a meta-analysis, 10 trials including 1195 patients were identified that evaluated the use of magnesium for this purpose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Ventricular arrhythmias occurred significantly less often in patients treated with magnesium compared to controls (6 versus 13 percent; relative risk 0.52). There was no effect on length of hospital stay, frequency of perioperative MI, or mortality.</p><p>Ischemic preconditioning reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury and appears to reduce sustained <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> after CABG. This was illustrated in a trial of 86 patients who were randomly assigned to two periods of two minutes of ischemia followed by three minutes of reperfusion or to no ischemic preconditioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. On continuous ECG monitoring, ischemic preconditioning was associated with significant reductions in VF after declamping (49 versus 79 percent) and VT during early reperfusion (0.7 versus 3.7 percent) and 24 hours after reperfusion (0.1 versus 2.1 percent).

The most common abnormalities are complete atrioventricular block with a narrow or wide complex escape rhythm, sinus node dysfunction, and a nodal rhythm.

The most frequent complaint is chest pain, occurring a few days to several weeks after surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-cardiac-injury-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-cardiac injury syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pericardial-complications-of-myocardial-infarction#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pericardial complications of myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Postcardiac injury syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Serial echocardiography shows that postoperative pericardial effusion is considerably more common than clinically apparent disease, occurring in as many as 85 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The effusion is usually present by the second postoperative day, but may not occur until day 10. In one report, effusion was present in 22 percent of patients at 20 days and 8 percent at 30 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>In most cases, the effusion is small and clinically insignificant; however, the effusion may be large, resulting in tamponade and hemodynamic instability and requiring urgent therapy with pericardiocentesis or reoperation. Postoperative anticoagulation may increase the risk of tamponade in patients who develop an effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-cardiac-complications-of-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. In some patients, continuing pericardial inflammation over months leads to a thickened, fibrous pericardium and the signs and symptoms of constrictive pericarditis.

There are three major concerns:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incomplete sternal healing. We suggest waiting at least six weeks prior to any procedure in which <span class=\"nowrap\">intubation/mechanical</span> ventilation may be necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacteremia in patients who have received prosthetic valves and are undergoing bowel or urological procedures.

Despite routine anticoagulation, thromboembolic risk is elevated early after mechanical or bioprosthetic valve replacement or mitral valve annuloplasty. Interruption of anticoagulation for surgery or complications of surgery may exacerbate this risk. We suggest waiting at least three months following valve surgery prior to elective noncardiac surgery.
