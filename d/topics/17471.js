The role of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI; also known as transcatheter AVR or TAVR) as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is evolving. Through both rapidly increasing clinical experience and progressive improvement in TAVI devices (eg, lower profile systems to reduce vascular complications), TAVI outcomes have improved. Ongoing studies continue to scrutinize the risks of TAVI complications and continuing efforts seek to minimize these risks. &#160;</p><p>Complications of TAVI will be considered in this topic commencing with immediate or periprocedural complications, which are usually apparent during or shortly after the procedure and moving to longer-term considerations. This topic will deal with periprocedural complications related to vascular access (including injury at the arterial access site, arterial tree trauma, and problems with vascular closure), valve deployment (including improper positioning, coronary compromise and annular rupture), valve function (including paravalvular leak), organ injury (including stroke, myocardial <span class=\"nowrap\">ischemia/injury,</span> and acute kidney injury), and arrhythmic complications (including high degree heart block and atrial fibrillation) and late complications including aortic regurgitation and prosthetic valve thrombosis.</p><p>Indications, clinical outcomes, and procedural management for TAVI are discussed separately.

In the PARTNER 1 trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], 30-day mortality was reported at 3.4 percent, whereas a similar figure (3.9 percent) was seen in patients at intermediate risk from the PARTNER IIA trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the large SAPIEN 3 registry, 30-day mortality was only 1.1 percent, whereas a similar figure was seen in the new generation Direct Flow valve. The Lotus cohort reported slightly higher periprocedural mortality at 4.2 percent.</p><p>Even though conversion to open heart surgery due to TAVI complications is rare (1.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], it should be noted that overall mortality for cases that undergo emergency surgery due to cardiovascular complications carry a very poor prognosis: 45.8 percent mortality at 30 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Reduction of the mortality risk of TAVI requires a multifactorial and multidisciplinary approach by an effective heart valve team for appropriate case selection, careful procedural planning including choice of suitable access route, technique and appropriate TAVI valve type and size, effective operator training and experience, meticulous attention to vascular closure, and judicious aftercare including appropriate rehabilitative measures and drug therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1037080415\"><span class=\"h2\">Access/vascular complications</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H982205698\"><span class=\"h3\">Bleeding and access-related complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early and late (30 or more days post-procedure) bleeding complications are not infrequent after TAVI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Much of the bleeding risk is access related. </p><p>Bleeding and other access-related complications may be detected during or following the procedure. The vast majority of TAVI procedures are performed via the transfemoral route [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and most of the data on complications is for transfemoral access. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H985584969\"><span class=\"h4\">Risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reported major bleeding rates at 30 days after TAVI have ranged from 17 to 24 percent in extreme-risk cohorts to 11 percent for high-risk cohorts to 7 to 10 percent in international registries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. In the TVT registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], major bleeding rates were on a decline from 5.5 percent in <span class=\"nowrap\">2012/2013</span> to 4.2 percent in 2014. A similar pattern was seen with regard to life-threatening bleeding, which reduced from 6.4 to 4.3 percent. In the large SAPIEN 3 registry, 30-day life-threatening or disabling bleeding was reported at 4.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Bleeding early after TAVI is a risk factor for mortality at 30 days and at one to two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>In a multicenter transfemoral TAVI registry from 2012, percutaneous access and closure was performed in 803 patients (81 percent) and a surgical strategy in 183 (19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Incidence of major vascular complications, <span class=\"nowrap\">life-threatening/disabling</span> bleeding, and major bleeding was 14.2, 11, and 17.8 percent, respectively. In the patient cohort with a completely percutaneous access strategy, major vascular complications and <span class=\"nowrap\">life-threatening/disabling</span> bleedings were related to closure device failure in 64 and 29 percent, respectively. </p><p>Results from 1078 intermediate-risk patients enrolled in the SAPIEN 3 observational study show a significant reduction in the incidence of major vascular complications (6.1 percent) and life-threatening or disabling bleeding (4.6 percent), which is partially due to the decreasing size of the delivery system sheaths and accumulating operator experience. In the TVT registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], capturing 26,414 patients undergoing TAVI implantation in 51 sites of United States and Canada, the rate of any vascular complications decreased from 5.6 percent in <span class=\"nowrap\">2012/2013</span> to 4.2 percent in 2014.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1179383309\"><span class=\"h4\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for access-related or vascular complications include sheath-to-artery ratio, presence of circumferential calcification, severe tortuosity, and percutaneous preclosure device failure. In the multicenter registry study cited above, female gender, use of &gt;19F system, peripheral arterial disease, and early stages of the learning curve were independent predictors for major or <span class=\"nowrap\">life-threatening/disabling</span> bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Mechanical factors that may contribute to the risk of bleeding include the use of large delivery catheters with associated high risk of major vascular complications, which may cause bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and the transapical approach with associated risk of myocardial tears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. While the first systems required 24 to 26F inner diameter sheaths, new generation TAVI devices with 14F inner diameter are now available. These technological advances, alongside accumulating operator experience, explain the dramatic reduction in major vascular complications from 11 to 14 percent in early studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>] to 4 to 6 percent in large registries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11</a>].</p><p>However, some patients receiving post-procedural blood transfusions have bleeding from sites not related to the procedure or no apparent source of bleeding. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4180678007\"><span class=\"h4\">Prevention and management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal choice of percutaneous closure device is controversial and new devices are under development. Many devices can achieve adequate hemostasis; however, appropriate device selection is important according to the access site anatomy, device caliber, and individual operator experience. At the end of the procedure, contralateral control peripheral angiography to confirm hemostasis is recommended, allowing early intervention for complications. </p><p>The majority of <span class=\"nowrap\">bleeding/vascular</span> access complications can be managed percutaneously. For this purpose, it is important to ensure continuous access to the punctured artery. This can be provided either by retrograde access from the contralateral side (often called cross-over) or by maintaining antegrade access with a wire following sheath removal. These options allow for placement of an occlusion balloon or a covered stent (self-expanding nitinol stent graft) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>A large propensity-matched study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] compared the incidence of major vascular complications in 944 TAVI patients (472 matched pairs) whose access was sealed percutaneously using Prostar-XL or Perclose ProGlide, the two most frequently used closure devices. Prostar was associated with higher rates of major vascular complications (7.4 versus 1.9 percent) and higher rates of major bleeding (16.7 versus 3.2 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3791756062\"><span class=\"h3\">Transapical tear/rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe access complications during transapical procedures are rare albeit challenging to manage surgically.

Right ventricular perforation is not an infrequent occurrence when a non-soft-tip active fixation temporary pacing wire is used and left in situ for 48 hours. In an early series, this complication accounted for 52.9 percent of cardiac tamponade cases post-TAVI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Left ventricular rupture occurs rarely (eg, 0.27 percent of TAVI cases) and accounts for 18.9 percent of cases requiring emergency open-heart surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and 23.5 percent of post-TAVI tamponade cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This complication can be reduced by use of pre-shaped TAVI specific guidewires. Ventricular septal defects have also been reported post-TAVI, particularly with balloon expandable valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Their location is most often at the membranous or perimembranous part of the septum (79 percent) adjacent to the valve landing zone. When causing symptoms or significant RV overload, these should be treated percutaneously where possible. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H374201084\"><span class=\"h2\">Valve-related complications</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1206440559\"><span class=\"h3\">Annular rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aortic annular rupture is a rare (eg, 0.17 percent) life-threatening complication of TAVI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. It involves injury of the aortic root or left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) may occur during balloon dilation of the native aortic valve, prosthetic valve deployment, or valve postdilatation for paravalvular regurgitation. Four types of annular rupture have been identified, including intra-annular, subannular, supra-annular, and combined. Risk factors include smaller annular size or sinotubular junction, bulky calcification of either valve leaflets or annulus, calcium in the LVOT or sinotubular junction, heavily calcified bicuspid valve, severe asymmetric subaortic LV hypertrophy, implantation of a balloon-expandable device, and aggressive balloon pre- or post-dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Management options range from emergent conversion to an open procedure with aortic root and valve replacement (accounting for 12.3 percent of all complications requiring conversion to open heart surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]) to pericardial drainage and autotransfusion of small leaks to comfort care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Annular rupture has not been reported with valve-in-valve procedures. </p><p>Meticulous valve sizing, scrutiny of calcium burden and location, and in particular avoiding oversized post-dilatation balloons can reduce the risk of this rare, yet potentially catastrophic complication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2978950666\"><span class=\"h3\">Transcatheter heart valve malpositioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>THV malpositioning can often occur in the setting of inadequate ventricular pacing (eg, interrupted stimulation due to pacing lead dislocation) or inadequate visualization of destination morphology (eg, noncoaxial orientation of the prosthesis towards annulus &ndash; parallax).<strong> </strong>In the large TVT registry (n = 26,414) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], THV migration occurred in 0.3 percent, THV embolized in the left ventricle in 0.3 percent, embolized in the aorta in 0.3 percent, and was retrieved in 0.4 percent of cases. Overall, valve migration accounted for 25.2 percent of cases requiring emergency open-heart surgery. New generation recapturable and repositionable valves (eg, CoreValve Evolut R, Lotus, Direct Flow Medical) have reduced the incidence of these catastrophic complications, which would often end up requiring urgent surgical intervention or complex percutaneous maneuvers. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H908964498\"><span class=\"h3\">Aortic regurgitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Post-TAVI aortic regurgitation includes paravalvular and central (valvular) jets.

There was no difference in pooled 30-day stroke post-TAVI between the CoreValve and Edwards Valve in multicenter (2.4 percent [95% CI 1.9-3.2] versus 3 percent [95% CI 2.4-3.7]) and single-center studies (3.8 percent [95% CI 2.8-4.9] versus 3.2 percent [95% CI 2.4-4.3]). There was a decline in stroke risk with experience and technological advancement. </p><p>Data from the randomized cohort A of the PARTNER balloon-expandable TAVI trial in high risk patients showed that rates of strokes or transient ischemic attack were significantly higher after TAVI than after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) at 30 days (5.5 versus 2.4 percent) and at one year (8.7 versus 4.3 percent), and there was a borderline significant trend at two years (11.2 versus 6.5 percent, p = 0.05) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/1,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,30</a>].

There was no significant differences in new-single, multiple, or total number of lesions. However, use of EPD was associated with significantly smaller ischemic volume per lesion (standardized mean difference, -0.52; 95% CI -0.85 to -0.20) and smaller total volume of ischemic lesions (standardized mean difference, -0.23; 95% CI -0.42 to -0.03).

A meta-analysis of three randomized, controlled trials studying the effect of the Sentinel cerebral embolic protection device in this setting found that the device significantly reduced the total new lesion volume in protected brain regions by approximately 100 mm<sup>3 </sup>on MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events at 30 days occurred at similar frequencies in the device and control groups (7.3 and 9.9 percent) and stroke rates at 30 days were also similar in device and control groups (5.6 and 9.1 percent). New lesion volume was similar in the device and control groups (102.8 and 178.0 mm<sup>3</sup>). Neurocognitive function was similar in control and device groups but there was a significant correlation between new lesion volume and neurocognitive decline. Limitations of this trial included insufficient sample size, technical issues with performance and timing of cerebral imaging, and incomplete cerebral protection (the device fully protected only 9 of 28 brain regions, given the dual blood supply of the posterior circulation). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H769590862\"><span class=\"h3\">Myocardial ischemia/injury</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1082490525\"><span class=\"h4\">Coronary obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One cause of ischemia and hypotension immediately following TAVI is coronary ostia occlusion, which may be treated by valve <span class=\"nowrap\">retrieval/repositioning,</span> percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3474309791\"><span class=\"h5\">With native aortic valve procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coronary obstruction is a rare complication of TAVI for native aortic valve stenosis, occurring in approximately 0.7 percent of procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Anatomic factors are similar to those for native aortic valve procedures, including low-lying coronary ostia and low or narrow sinuses of Valsalva. The main predisposing factor in the setting of valve in valve procedures is the proximity of the coronary ostia to the anticipated final position of the displaced bioprosthetic leaflets after THV implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-aortic-valve-implantation-complications/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Assessment by echocardiography may be difficult due to presence of multiple, eccentric, irregularly-shaped jets that may be aligned along off-axis imaging planes. Imaging of the jets may be suboptimal due to acoustic shadowing from calcifications or from the THV.

The mean transprosthetic gradient in patients with VHD increased from 9.5&plusmn;5 mmHg at hospital discharge to 26.1&plusmn;11 mmHg at follow-up. Independent predictors of transcatheter valve VHD at follow-up included absence of anticoagulation at discharge, Valve-in-valve procedure, &le;23 mm THV size and increased body mass index.
