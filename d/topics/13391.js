Although several classifications exist, there are four major &quot;primary&quot; perforating disorders grouped according to the types of epidermal disruption, nature of eliminated material, and clinical features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reactive perforating collagenosis (RPC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109880\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109880 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109885%7EDERM%2F53188\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109885 graphicRef53188 \">picture 2A-B</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perforating folliculitis (PF) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109890%7EDERM%2F109892\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109890 graphicRef109892 \">picture 3A-B</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquired perforating dermatosis (APD, which encompasses Kyrle disease, acquired RPC, acquired PF, and acquired EPS and is often associated with underlying chronic renal failure or diabetes mellitus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109893%7EDERM%2F109894\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109893 graphicRef109894 \">picture 4A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109809\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109809 \">table 1</a>)</p><p/><p>Of note, cases of clinical and histologic overlap among the perforating diseases have been reported, and diagnostic criteria are not well defined for each entity. Additionally, there are &quot;secondary&quot; perforating diseases in which transepidermal elimination occurs only as part of the underlying primary dermatosis. These disorders often involve elimination of endogenous material, foreign material, infectious organisms, granulomatous material, or neoplastic cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109808\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109808 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of the primary perforating dermatoses will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56212587\"><span class=\"h1\">REACTIVE PERFORATING COLLAGENOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First described in 1967, reactive perforating collagenosis (RPC, MIM #216700) is a rare genetic disorder that usually begins in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the literature. The mode of inheritance is unclear since autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and sporadic cases have each been reported. Acquired RPC is a manifestation of acquired perforating dermatosis (APD) and considered separate from RPC. (See <a href=\"#H3793147941\" class=\"local\">'Acquired perforating dermatosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2747520365\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of RPC is unknown. No specific genetic defect has been identified. An abnormal response to superficial trauma may contribute to lesion development. Experimental production of the classic RPC<em> </em>lesion has been reported with a needle scratch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2126422640\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with RPC develop small keratotic papules that arise after superficial trauma. These grow within weeks to larger, umbilicated papulonodules, usually on the arms and hands, although they can develop anywhere on the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109880\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109880 \">picture 1</a>). RPC may koebnerize (occur in sites of skin trauma), commonly resulting in a linear configuration of nodules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109882\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109882 \">picture 5</a>). Mucosal involvement is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Lesions often present in multiple stages of development and regression and vary from several to more than 30 in an individual patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The papulonodules may resolve over six to eight weeks with resultant scarring <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> postinflammatory hyperpigmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H502022890\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with other perforating diseases, the histology depends on the stage of the lesion. New papulonodules display epidermal hyperplasia and degenerated basophilic collagen fibers. Later lesions demonstrate an invagination of the epidermis with a keratin plug. Vertically oriented basophilic collagen fibers are frequently seen with focal extrusions through the epidermis, highlighted with Verhoeff-Van Gieson staining, which stains the collagen fibers red. Typically, no staining of elastic fibers should be seen, in contrast to elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS). An associated perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H587892360\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnosis of RPC is made based upon the recognition of consistent histologic findings (collagen within a keratin plug or extruding through the epidermis), consistent clinical features (keratotic papules or umbilicated papulonodules), an early age of onset, and the absence of a disease associated with APD. A punch biopsy typically provides a sufficient specimen for histopathologic examination. (See <a href=\"#H3793147941\" class=\"local\">'Acquired perforating dermatosis'</a> below.)</p><p>A positive family history provides additional support for this diagnosis. There is no genetic test for RPC. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2621258343\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis is similar for many of the perforating disorders. The physical and histologic findings, childhood onset, and family history help distinguish RPC from the following entities:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Folliculitis</strong> &ndash; Folliculitis can usually be differentiated by the appearance of pustules, some with a central hair protruding, or erythematous, inflamed papules in a hair-bearing site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F103500\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103500 \">picture 6</a>). A biopsy would demonstrate inflammatory cells in the follicular wall and ostia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-folliculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious folliculitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Arthropod bites</strong> &ndash; Although clinically similar to RPC, arthropod bites often lack an umbilicated center and histologically reveal a predominately eosinophilic infiltrate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insect-bites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insect bites&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prurigo nodularis</strong> &ndash; Prurigo nodularis may clinically resemble RPC; however, the lesions of prurigo nodularis are usually more nodular and histologically show compact hyperkeratosis, irregular acanthosis, and a perivascular inflammatory infiltrate with thickened dermal collagen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F53475\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53475 \">picture 7</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prurigo-nodularis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prurigo nodularis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Multiple keratoacanthoma</strong> &ndash; Clinically, keratoacanthomas are more crater like than RPC and filled with a keratinaceous crust (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F50780\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50780 \">picture 8</a>). Histologically, they demonstrate a central core of keratin and mild pleomorphism with a well-differentiated squamous epithelium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=keratoacanthoma-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-diagnosis#H2295938\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Keratoacanthoma: Epidemiology, risk factors, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Multiple keratoacanthomas'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dermatofibroma</strong> &ndash; Dermatofibromas usually occur as solitary, firm, flesh-colored nodules, commonly on the lower extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109884\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109884 \">picture 9</a>). On histology, dermatofibromas show a dermal spindle cell proliferation with trapped collagen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-benign-lesions-of-the-skin#H1101419831\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of benign lesions of the skin&quot;, section on 'Dermatofibroma'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3661862863\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with RPC have mild disease that is rarely problematic and spontaneously resolves. Simple observation and avoidance of trauma, while waiting for lesions to involute, is the mainstay of management.</p><p>In select cases with widespread involvement or severe symptoms, treatment may be indicated. No randomized controlled trials have evaluated treatments for RPC, and the following treatments are based solely on data from case reports and case series. Improvement has been demonstrated with topical corticosteroids, intralesional corticosteroids, and topical retinoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a> has been reported to reduce the development of new lesions over a 10-month period at doses of 25 to 35 mg weekly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Treatment failures have been documented with oral vitamin A, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, oral antibiotics, and topical keratolytics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The management of RPC that occurs as a manifestation of APD is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"#H3793147941\" class=\"local\">'Acquired perforating dermatosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3938922061\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The disease often persists into adulthood and may cause some residual scarring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3017027890\"><span class=\"h1\">ELASTOSIS PERFORANS SERPIGINOSA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First described in 1953 as keratosis follicularis perforans, elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS) is a rare disorder that begins in early childhood or young adulthood and exhibits transepidermal elimination of abnormal elastic fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Approximately 25 to 40 percent of cases of EPS occur in association with genetic diseases such as Down syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, acrogeria, Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, and osteogenesis imperfecta. Alternatively, EPS can be familial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Approximately 75 percent of affected patients are male [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>A drug-induced form of EPS also exists (see <a href=\"#H192967688\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below). Rarely, EPS occurs as a manifestation of acquired perforating dermatosis (APD). (See <a href=\"#H3793147941\" class=\"local\">'Acquired perforating dermatosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H192967688\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although some authors theorize that focal irritation in the dermis may cause the formation of the epidermal and follicular channels that extrude the irritating agent, the pathogenesis of EPS remains unknown.</p><p>Drug-induced EPS most often occurs in relation to D-penicillamine use, which disturbs desmosine crosslinks within elastin. D-penicillamine-induced EPS generally develops several years after drug initiation. Although D-penicillamine has been used to treat Wilson disease, cystinuria, and rheumatoid arthritis, EPS has primarily been reported in patients treated for Wilson disease, probably because these patients require high drug levels over many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2290386428\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EPS presents as skin-colored to slightly erythematous, keratotic, small papules arranged in an annular or serpiginous pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109885%7EDERM%2F53188\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109885 graphicRef53188 \">picture 2A-B</a>). EPS often develops on the lateral neck and occasionally occurs on the face, arms, or flexural areas. Lesions may have central scaling, atrophy, or hypopigmentation and can be arranged symmetrically with satellite lesions. While generally asymptomatic, EPS is sometimes pruritic. As with other perforating disorders, papules and plaques in different stages of development are often visible. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H672066559\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histologically, EPS displays a narrow, transepidermal or perifollicular canal extending in a straight or corkscrew pattern from the dermis. There is a mixture of degenerated, eosinophilic elastic fibers, basophilic debris, and mixed inflammatory cells with lymphocytes, macrophages, or multinucleated giant cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. A notable increase in the thickness and amount of papillary dermal elastic tissue can be visible. The epidermis may be acanthotic and hyperkeratotic. Verhoeff-Van Gieson staining of elastic fibers can highlight the distinctive changes of EPS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109886\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109886 \">picture 10</a>). </p><p>Characteristically, light and electron microscopy of D-penicillamine-induced EPS display a &quot;bramble-bush&quot; or &quot;lumpy-bumpy&quot; appearance of the elastic fibers, with elastic tissue changes occurring in lesional and nonlesional skin, differentiating it from other forms of EPS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109899%7EDERM%2F109900\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109899 graphicRef109900 \">picture 11A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4129563661\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of EPS is based on the recognition of the classic histopathologic findings of transepidermal elimination of elastic fibers in the context of annular or serpiginous, keratotic papules. A punch biopsy of a representative lesion is appropriate to confirm the diagnosis. Adult-onset EPS that occurs in the setting of systemic disease, such as renal failure or diabetes mellitus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109809\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109809 \">table 1</a>), is considered a manifestation of APD.

However, granuloma annulare generally lacks any associated scale and on biopsy reveals palisading granulomas.

Biopsy, however, will reveal non-necrotizing granulomas.

Lesions are usually chronic in nature and are often found in sun-exposed areas. A biopsy will help distinguish DLE from EPS; superficial and deep perivascular and periadnexal lymphocytic infiltrates are seen in DLE.

A variety of topical medical and destructive treatments have been used; however, no randomized clinical trials exist, and published treatment recommendations are based on case reports. Also, the potential for spontaneous resolution makes it difficult to adequately interpret therapeutic efficacy. </p><p>Common well-tolerated initial treatments for small areas of EPS include moderate-potency topical corticosteroids, topical retinoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], cellophane tape stripping (to remove keratinous material) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], cryosurgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], and electrodesiccation and curettage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Successful treatment of D-penicillamine-induced EPS with a fractional carbon dioxide laser has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Reported therapies with little to no sustained success include calcipotriene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], glycolic or salicylic acid, and narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H268829001\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EPS can persist for several years before spontaneously resolving but has a tendency to recur.

Whether PF exists as a separate, definable perforating disorder, or is a feature of a wide variety of cutaneous diseases where follicular perforation or disruption occurs, is controversial. Classically (and in the authors' opinion), PF is its own entity. PF occurring in the setting of underlying systemic disease, such as chronic renal failure or diabetes mellitus, is an exception. Such cases may be considered a manifestation of acquired perforating dermatosis (APD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109809\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109809 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3793147941\" class=\"local\">'Acquired perforating dermatosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Relatively uncommon, PF occurs in patients ranging in age from 6 to 72 years, affecting males and females equally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perforating-dermatoses/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Other clinicians have theorized that mechanical disruption of the follicular epithelium by an entrapped hair may be causative, as trapped hairs may be seen on cross sectioning of some specimens.

KP papules are smaller and more closely grouped than PF. Histologically, KP demonstrates conical follicular dilation with orthokeratotic keratinaceous material but has neither follicular disruption nor an inflammatory cell infiltrate.

While PF can appear to have a central pustule, the central plug of PF is not composed of purulent material but rather keratinaceous material. On biopsy, PF also has no acute follicular inflammation, as demonstrated in bacterial folliculitis. If bacterial colonies are histologically present in PF, they are located only in the superficial portion of the hair follicle, in contrast to bacterial folliculitis, where the bacteria may be observed deep in the hair follicle as well.

Biopsy reveals a cup-shaped invagination with a keratotic plug penetrating the papillary dermis with underlying dermal lymphocytic and histiocytic infiltrate. Orthokeratosis, parakeratosis, and abnormal keratinization may be evident. Transepidermal elimination of collagen, elastic fibers, and degenerated follicular material with or without collagen and elastin may be visualized, as seen in classic RPC, EPS, and PF, respectively.

(See <a href=\"#H56212587\" class=\"local\">'Reactive perforating collagenosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3017027890\" class=\"local\">'Elastosis perforans serpiginosa'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3998359690\" class=\"local\">'Perforating folliculitis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3793147941\" class=\"local\">'Acquired perforating dermatosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The response to treatment of perforating dermatoses is variable. Most patients, especially with RPC or EPS, require little treatment other than avoidance of trauma to the skin. Patients with APD often undergo treatments aimed at controlling pruritus and the underlying systemic disorder with variable results. (See <a href=\"#H56212587\" class=\"local\">'Reactive perforating collagenosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3017027890\" class=\"local\">'Elastosis perforans serpiginosa'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3998359690\" class=\"local\">'Perforating folliculitis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3793147941\" class=\"local\">'Acquired perforating dermatosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data on the treatment of APD are limited. Our initial approach consists of treatment of the underlying disease and measures to reduce pruritus, including camphor- or menthol-based lotions, bathing with gentle cleansers, and skin moisturization. Topical corticosteroids may provide additional relief from pruritus, when needed. Topical keratolytics or retinoids may help to improve the appearance of APD. Patients for whom these measures are insufficient may benefit from other treatments.
