In the United States, it is the sixth most common cancer in men and the sixth in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; its incidence increases with age. Five-year survival rates for people with melanoma depend on the stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis. There are five stages: stage 0 is in situ (intraepithelial) melanoma, stages I and II are localized invasive cutaneous disease, stage III is regional nodal disease, and stage IV is distant metastatic disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110663 \">table 1</a>). Most people with thin stage I melanoma can expect prolonged disease-free survival and likely cure following treatment, whereas those with more advanced stage II to IV lesions are more likely to develop metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the clinical features and diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma.

During this stage, known as the horizontal or &quot;radial&quot; growth phase, the melanoma is almost always curable by surgical excision alone. Melanomas that infiltrate into the dermis are considered to be in a &quot;vertical&quot; growth phase and have metastatic or &quot;tumorigenic&quot; potential. Nodular melanomas have no identifiable radial growth or in situ phase and appear to enter the vertical growth phase from their inception, resulting in thicker tumors at diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathologic characteristics of melanoma&quot;, section on 'Growth phases of melanoma'</a>.)</p><p>The probability of metastases with invasive, vertical growth-phase melanoma is most strongly predicted by measuring the thickness of the tumor (ie, Breslow depth), in millimeters, from the granular cell layer of the epidermis (or overlying area of ulceration) to the deepest malignant cell in the dermis or subcutaneous fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other histologic factors, including ulceration of the tumor, mitotic rate, presence of lymphovascular invasion, microsatellites, perineural invasion, and the presence of lymphocytes infiltrating the tumor, can also affect risk of local recurrence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> metastatic potential of the tumor.

Over 60 percent of superficial spreading melanomas are diagnosed as thin, highly curable tumors that are less than or equal to 1 mm thickness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Approximately two-thirds of all melanomas arise de novo without an associated nevus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], though superficial spreading melanoma is the subtype most likely to be associated with a preexisting nevus. Superficial spreading melanoma can occur in any anatomic location but has a predilection for the back in men and women and lower extremities in women.</p><p>Superficial spreading melanoma typically presents as a variably pigmented macule or thin plaque with an irregular border, ranging from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F64980%7EDERM%2F61158%7EDERM%2F71893%7EPC%2F57466%7EDERM%2F74278\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64980 graphicRef61158 graphicRef71893 graphicRef57466 graphicRef74278 \">picture 2A-E</a>).

They may appear as darkly pigmented, pedunculated, or polypoid papules or nodules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F80955\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80955 \">picture 1</a>) but frequently present with uniform color or <span class=\"nowrap\">amelanotic/pink</span> hue, symmetric borders, and relatively small diameter, making early detection difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. While the majority of superficial spreading melanomas and lentigo maligna melanomas are diagnosed at less than 1 mm thickness, most nodular melanomas are thicker than 2 mm at the time of the diagnosis. Likewise, over 50 percent of melanomas greater than 2 mm in thickness are the nodular subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The pathologic features of nodular melanoma are discussed separately.

The lesion gradually enlarges over years and may develop darker, asymmetric foci of pigmentation, color variegation, and raised areas that signify vertical growth within the precursor in situ melanoma, which is termed &quot;lentigo maligna&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F74664%7EDERM%2F54753%7EDERM%2F57765%7EPC%2F62105\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74664 graphicRef54753 graphicRef57765 graphicRef62105 \">picture 3A-D</a>).

However, it is the most common type of melanoma among dark-skinned individuals, who are at lower risk for more sun-related melanoma subtypes. Acral lentiginous melanomas arise most commonly on palmar, plantar, and subungual surfaces (beneath the nail plate). Acral lentiginous melanomas first appear as dark brown to black, irregularly pigmented macules or patches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F51085%7EDERM%2F63894%7EPC%2F78826\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51085 graphicRef63894 graphicRef78826 \">picture 4A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], with raised areas, ulceration, bleeding, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> larger diameter generally signifying deeper invasion in the dermis. Occasionally, acral melanoma can present as amelanotic or hypomelanotic lesions mimicking benign diseases, such as warts, calluses, tinea pedis, nonhealing ulcers, or ingrown toenails [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p>Subungual melanoma arises from the nail matrix and usually presents as a longitudinal brown or black band in the fingernail or toenail, with or without nail dystrophy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F64134%7EDERM%2F52821%7EDERM%2F75881%7EDERM%2F51165\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64134 graphicRef52821 graphicRef75881 graphicRef51165 \">picture 5A-D</a>). Subungual melanoma may present as a mass below the nail plate (with or without pigmentation) with ulceration and nail plate destruction. It can also mimic conditions such as onychomycosis or paronychia, which leads to delay in diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Since pigmented longitudinal bands within the nail plate can be observed in a number of benign nail conditions, dermatology specialist consultation is often necessary for diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Although amelanotic melanoma is less common than clinically pigmented melanoma, representing approximately 2 to 8 percent of cases, it poses serious diagnostic challenges for patients and clinicians alike. Lesions may present as pink or red macules, plaques, or nodules, often with well-defined borders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62791%7EDERM%2F51998\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62791 graphicRef51998 \">picture 6A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. Some tumors may present a subtle light-brown pigmentation. Amelanotic melanomas are often clinically confused with benign lesions (eg, melanocytic nevus, inflamed seborrheic keratosis, ruptured hair follicle or cyst, hemangioma, pyogenic granuloma), often leading to considerable delay in the diagnosis and potential worse prognosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55929581\"><span class=\"h3\">Spitzoid melanoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;spitzoid melanoma&quot; has been used to indicate a subset of melanomas that have a morphologic resemblance to Spitz tumors, both clinically and histologically. These lesions usually present as faintly erythematous growing papules or nodules. They can be amelanotic or have a brown, black, or blue color. Although spitzoid melanomas generally have more severe histologic atypia than atypical Spitz tumors, histologic differentiation of these lesions may be challenging, often requiring additional molecular tests (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F85847\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85847 \">table 2</a>).

It presents as a slowly growing plaque, nodule, or scar-like growth, and it is usually amelanotic and located in chronically sun-exposed areas of older patients. Desmoplastic melanoma may clinically simulate a scar, other benign process, or nonmelanoma skin cancer (eg, basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma) and so tends to be diagnosed when the tumor is thicker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2087413800\"><span class=\"h3\">Pigment synthesizing (animal-type) melanoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pigment synthesizing (animal-type) melanoma (also termed &quot;melanocytoma&quot;) is a rare subtype of melanoma comprised of heavily pigmented dermal epithelioid and spindled melanocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. It presents as a blue-black or blue, slow-growing nodule most frequently located on the extremities and, less commonly, on the <span class=\"nowrap\">head/neck</span> and trunk. Animal-type melanoma is considered an indolent type of melanoma, with low incidence of metastasis and low mortality rate, despite a high frequency of positive sentinel lymph nodes. The histopathologic diagnosis may be difficult due to overlapping features with other dermal melanocytic proliferations, such as common blue nevus, cellular blue nevus, malignant blue nevus, and Spitz nevus.

However, in contrast with saucerization, which is performed using a shave biopsy blade and extends into the reticular dermis, a disk excision is a full-thickness circular incision performed with a scalpel and extending vertically into the subcutaneous fat. Both guidelines recommend that superficial shave biopsy should be limited to lesions for which the suspicion of melanoma is low and performed to a depth below the anticipated plane of the lesion. A broad shave biopsy is often most helpful for diagnosis of melanoma in situ, lentigo maligna type. By contrast, the revised United Kingdom guidelines recommend that shave biopsies should be avoided as they may lead to incorrect diagnosis due to sampling error [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. There is general consensus that partial or incisional biopsy may be occasionally acceptable for very large lesions or for certain sites, including the face, palm or sole, ear, distal digit, or subungual lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/77,78,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78,81</a>].</p><p>Detailed clinical information on excised lesions, including anatomic location, type of biopsy performed and intent (excisional or incisional), size of the lesion, and marking of suspicious foci, should be provided to the pathologist; additional information on ABCDE criteria, dermoscopic features, or clinical or dermoscopic images, if available, would also be useful, especially for incisional or punch biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,83</a>].</p><p>Biopsy of the nail matrix may be warranted for a pigmented nail band with any of the following characteristics: dark color, solitary, dyshomogeneous pigmentation, change in shape or pigmentation, width &gt;3 mm, or irregular margins. The presence of periungual pigmentation (Hutchinson sign) is an additional indication for biopsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F102761\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef102761 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Since no single pathologic feature of melanoma is diagnostic, the histopathologic diagnosis is based upon a combination of architectural, cytologic, and host response features. The presence of atypical melanocytes (ie, melanocytes that are larger than normal and have large hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear shape and nuclear polymorphism, abnormal chromatin pattern, and prominent nucleoli) and architectural disorder (ie, asymmetry, poor circumscription, nests of melanocytes of various sizes and shapes in the lower epidermis and dermis) are required for the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62540\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62540 \">picture 7</a>). The histopathologic features of the major subtypes of melanoma are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathologic characteristics of melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although the histopathologic diagnosis of melanoma is often straightforward, in some cases, it can be difficult even for the experienced pathologist. In addition, the interpretation of a melanocytic lesion is largely subjective and may vary among pathologists and even experienced dermatopathologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. </p><p>In a study of accuracy and reproducibility of the histopathologic diagnosis of melanocytic skin lesions, 187 pathologists experienced in pigmented lesion interpretation independently evaluated 240 melanocytic lesions ranging from benign nevi to dysplastic nevi to invasive melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. The diagnostic accuracy using a consensus diagnosis of experienced pathologists as reference was relatively high for benign nevi (including mildly dysplastic nevi) and thin invasive melanoma (92 and 72 percent, respectively) but poor for lesions with moderate atypia, severe atypia or melanoma in situ, and early invasive melanoma (25, 40, and 43 percent, respectively). The study estimated that at a population level, approximately 83 percent of biopsied melanocytic lesions would have the diagnosis confirmed by consensus of three experienced dermatopathologists, whereas 8 to 9 percent would be over- or under-interpreted by the initial pathologist. The authors concluded that a standardized melanocytic neoplasm classification format could mitigate the lack of pathologic diagnosis reproducibility and accuracy, in an effort to avoid miscommunication and management errors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3162649586\"><span class=\"h2\">Ancillary techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunohistochemistry can be helpful in the evaluation of difficult melanocytic lesions.

Newer molecular techniques may aid in melanoma diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].

Histologic findings of ulceration and mitotic rate are also significant prognostic features. (See <a href=\"#H137428425\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient's history (including personal and family history of melanoma, sun exposure habits, and history of sunburns), presence of fair skin, &gt;50 common nevi, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinically atypical nevi are important aspects of the clinical evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for the development of melanoma&quot;, section on 'Geographic and ethnic variation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early signs of melanoma include asymmetry, irregular borders, variegated color, diameter &ge;6 mm, and a recent change in or development of a new lesion, particularly in adults. A skin lesion that looks different from other surrounding lesions (&quot;ugly duckling&quot; sign) is an important finding in patients with multiple nevi.
