The condition is categorized as a central disorder of hypersomnolence; other sleep disorders in this category include narcolepsy type 1 and type 2 and Kleine-Levin syndrome (recurrent hypersomnia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The pathophysiology of idiopathic hypersomnia is not well understood, and diagnosis requires exclusion of other more common causes of excessive sleepiness. When a diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia is established, treatment is largely pharmacologic and aimed at control of symptoms, with generally good, but somewhat variable results.</p><p>This topic will discuss the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia. An approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-excessive-daytime-sleepiness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29343726\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of idiopathic hypersomnia in the general population is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], in part because laboratory-based polysomnography and other assessments that would be necessary to rule out other causes of excessive daytime sleepiness have not been feasible in large numbers of unselected, representative subjects from the community. Based largely on sleep center referrals, idiopathic hypersomnia appears to be one-tenth to one-half as common as narcolepsy, suggesting a prevalence of approximately 20 to 50 cases per million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. There is no clear gender association.</p><p>The onset of idiopathic hypersomnia typically occurs between 10 and 30 years of age. In a series of 77 patients, the mean age of symptom onset was 17 and the mean age of diagnosis was 30 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29343733\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of idiopathic hypersomnia is not well understood.</p><p>Some cases may be precipitated by a viral illness, suggesting a possible autoimmune etiology. Reports of distinctive HLA markers have been inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A series of 138 patients with idiopathic hypersomnia found that the prevalence of inflammatory disorders, allergies, and family members with inflammatory disorders was increased in patients compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>One small study suggested that an endogenous substance in the cerebrospinal fluid of some patients with primary hypersomnias, including idiopathic hypersomnia, may enhance inhibitory signaling through gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors, thereby promoting sleepiness; the effects were reversed in vitro by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flumazenil</a>, which also normalized vigilance in seven patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A pilot study from the same group found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a> improved subjective sleepiness without improving objective signs of alertness in patients with evidence of abnormal GABA<sub>A</sub> potentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In contrast, a separate study could not confirm in vitro GABA<sub>A</sub> potentiation with cerebrospinal fluid from 15 patients with idiopathic hypersomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Nonetheless, limited data suggest that flumazenil may be beneficial in some patients. (See <a href=\"#H2521197907\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Hypocretin-1, the wake-promoting neurotransmitter found to be absent or deficient in patients with narcolepsy type 1, is normal in idiopathic hypersomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Standard cerebral spinal fluid tests are normal, although one study found altered dopamine and indoleacetic acid levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] and another suggested dysregulation of norepinephrine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults#H3830874\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of narcolepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Orexin/hypocretin'</a>.)</p><p>A familial tendency can be seen in as many as half the subjects, with both idiopathic hypersomnia and narcolepsy being reported in other family members. Some familial patterns suggest an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29343740\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical patient with idiopathic hypersomnia is an adolescent or young adult who complains of chronic and disabling excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Affected patients are unable to maintain wakefulness and alertness during the major waking episodes of the day, with sleep occurring unintentionally or at inappropriate times and interfering with function. The onset of EDS is often insidious, developing over several weeks to months. Scores on subjective assessments of EDS such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F77101\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77101 \">table 1</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-epworth-sleepiness-scale-ess-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) are abnormally high (10 or higher). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quantifying-sleepiness#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Quantifying sleepiness&quot;, section on 'Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)'</a>.)</p><p>Daytime sleepiness leads to naps that tend to be long (an hour or more) and unrefreshing. Many patients take naps on five or more days per week. Unlike patients with narcolepsy, patients with idiopathic hypersomnia do not generally have sleep attacks (instances of irresistible sleep). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults#H23311070\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of narcolepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Daytime sleepiness'</a>.)</p><p>Total 24-hour sleep time and nocturnal sleep time are often, but not always, prolonged in patients with idiopathic hypersomnia. The 24-hour sleep duration is often 12 to 14 hours. Sleeping longer at night does not appear to improve the EDS.</p><p>Another common feature of idiopathic hypersomnia can be difficulty arousing from nocturnal sleep periods or daytime naps. Patients often report transient periods of confusion and &quot;sleep drunkenness&quot; upon awakening. Other features that are common but nonspecific in patients with hypersomnolence include automatic behaviors during wakefulness, sleep paralysis (complete inability to move for several minutes upon awakening), and hypnagogic hallucinations (vivid visual, tactile, or auditory dream-like experiences that occur as the patient is falling asleep) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a prospective study of 75 patients referred to a sleep disorders unit for EDS and who met diagnostic criteria for idiopathic hypersomnia, sleep drunkenness was reported by 36 percent of patients, sleep paralysis by 28 percent, and hypnagogic hallucinations by 24 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Consequences of excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with idiopathic hypersomnia resemble those seen in patients with sleepiness from other causes. Work productivity, relationships, family obligations, enjoyment of free time, driving, and safety can all be affected. Idiopathic hypersomnia can be associated with depression as well as nonspecific neurological symptoms such as headache, lightheadedness, orthostatic hypotension, or syncope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29343747\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic hypersomnia is a clinical diagnosis that should be considered in a teenager or adult who complains of chronic excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) with long unrefreshing daytime naps and difficulty arousing from sleep, in the absence of symptoms suggestive of other common causes of EDS such as insufficient sleep, depression, sedating medications, and sleep-related breathing disorders. Idiopathic hypersomnia is in part a diagnosis of exclusion that is achieved by a thorough history and polysomnography to ensure that other causes of EDS are not present. If concern exists about the accuracy of patient-reported sleep duration, a sleep log (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F87134\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87134 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F87859\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87859 \">table 3</a>) or an activity monitor (actigraphy) should be used for confirmation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-actigraphy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of actigraphy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This evaluation should distinguish EDS from other common complaints such as fatigue and low energy, which may trigger evaluation for other primary causes. The medication list should be reviewed for drugs that can cause EDS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F86811\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86811 \">table 4</a>) and patients should be screened for depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-excessive-daytime-sleepiness#H1822286\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=excessive-daytime-sleepiness-due-to-medical-disorders-and-medications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Excessive daytime sleepiness due to medical disorders and medications&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Other tests, such as cerebrospinal fluid analysis, HLA testing, and quantification of hypocretin levels, are not usually necessary and do not reliably contribute to the diagnostic evaluation. They may be sought on occasion to help confirm the presence of narcolepsy type 1, as opposed to idiopathic hypersomnia. Hypocretin levels are primarily a research tool, however, and clinical testing is not currently available in the United States. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults#H376017\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of narcolepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2247826\"><span class=\"h2\">Polysomnography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should undergo nocturnal polysomnography to exclude other causes of EDS and especially subtle forms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2247265\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p>In idiopathic hypersomnia, polysomnography may show a short sleep latency, increased sleep spindles, increased deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, increased sleep efficiency, and increased total sleep time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/3,4,17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,17,20</a>]. While these findings are supportive of a diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia, they are not specific for the diagnosis.</p><p>The polysomnogram may provide evidence of other sleep disorders, effectively precluding a diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In OSA, polysomnography shows increased numbers of obstructive apneas, hypopneas, and respiratory effort-related arousals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In central sleep apnea, polysomnography shows increased numbers of central apneas, hypopneas, and associated arousals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-sleep-apnea-risk-factors-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis#H4409791\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central sleep apnea: Risk factors, clinical presentation, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In narcolepsy, polysomnography may demonstrate spontaneous awakenings, mildly reduced sleep efficiency, and rapid eye movement sleep within 15 minutes of the onset of sleep, though these findings are not specific or diagnostic for narcolepsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults#H376017\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of narcolepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2247851\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiple sleep latency test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On the day after the duration and quality of nocturnal sleep have been characterized by nocturnal polysomnography, the patient should undergo a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). This is a series of five daytime nap opportunities that together allow objective characterization of the patient's level of daytime sleepiness, or physiological sleep tendency, as reflected by the mean sleep latency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Care must be taken to perform the MSLT under optimal conditions that are conducive for sleep. In addition, patients must have had sufficient sleep on the night prior to the MSLT for results to be valid and reliable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quantifying-sleepiness#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Quantifying sleepiness&quot;, section on 'Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT)'</a>.)</p><p>In idiopathic hypersomnia, the mean sleep latency is shortened, generally less than eight minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The number of sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs) is less than two. This result is important because two or more SOREMPs suggest a diagnosis of narcolepsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2247436\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, a diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia requires all of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daily periods of irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep for at least three months</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cataplexy is absent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) documents fewer than two sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs), or no SOREMPs if the REM sleep latency on the preceding polysomnogram was &le;15 minutes (see <a href=\"#H2247851\" class=\"local\">'Multiple sleep latency test'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of at least one of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>MSLT shows a mean sleep latency of &le;8 minutes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Total 24-hour sleep time is &ge;660 minutes (typically 12 to 14 hours) on 24-hour polysomnography or by wrist actigraphy in association with a sleep log</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insufficient sleep syndrome is ruled out (if deemed necessary, by lack of improvement of sleepiness after an adequate trial of increased nocturnal time in bed, preferably confirmed by at least a week of wrist actigraphy)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No better explanation by another sleep disorder, medical or psychiatric disorder or use of drugs or medications</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2247265\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic hypersomnia is one of the less common causes of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), although it is not an uncommon diagnosis among patients referred to a sleep disorders clinic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F86811\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86811 \">table 4</a>). More commonly encountered explanations, aside from chronically insufficient sleep and medication side effects, include narcolepsy type 1 or type 2, sleep-related breathing disorders, and psychiatric disorders. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Narcolepsy</strong> &ndash; Narcolepsy type 1 (narcolepsy with cataplexy) classically consists of the tetrad of EDS (sometimes with irresistible &quot;sleep attacks&quot;), cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. While cataplexy is highly specific for narcolepsy, its onset can be delayed for months or even years after the onset of EDS, and other patients never develop cataplexy (ie, narcolepsy type 2). This means that the diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia might be considered. In most cases, polysomnography and the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) will confirm the diagnosis of narcolepsy based on an increased number of sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults#H23706075\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of narcolepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Certain aspects of the sleep history may also be helpful. In one series, patients with idiopathic hypersomnia were more likely to sleep nine or more hours per night, to have sleep drunkenness, and in particular, to take daytime naps that exceed 60 minutes, compared with patients with narcolepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, another published series did not show these differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sleep-related breathing disorders</strong> &ndash; Sleep-related breathing disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, and sleep-related hypoventilation, must be differentiated from idiopathic hypersomnia. Subtle forms of obstructive sleep apnea in particular can sometimes be missed, leading to a premature diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia. Esophageal pressure monitoring may be useful in conjunction with standard polysomnography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polysomnography-in-the-evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-adults#H86030363\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polysomnography in the evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing in adults&quot;, section on 'Respiratory effort'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One older study showed that among 48 patients initially diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia, use of esophageal pressure monitoring to detect subtle sleep-disordered breathing led to reclassification of 15 (31 percent) of the subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These subjects' subjective sleepiness, objectively-assessed sleepiness, and nocturnal sleep fragmentation responded to continuous positive airway pressure. In more recent years, use of nasal pressure monitoring and more sensitive definitions for hypopneas have probably made missed diagnoses of subtle OSA less common.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypersomnia associated with psychiatric disorders</strong> &ndash; Psychiatric disorders such as atypical depression, bipolar depression, and dysthymia are commonly associated with complaints of EDS. Other symptoms, such as depressed mood, long sleep times, and sleep inertia, can also overlap with those of idiopathic hypersomnia. Polysomnographic findings may be very similar, but the MSLT is more likely to show normal mean sleep latencies in patients with psychiatric disease. In unclear cases, formal psychiatric assessment or a trial of an antidepressant may be needed to distinguish the two.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29343761\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The underlying causes of idiopathic hypersomnia are not known, and therefore treatment is symptomatic. Nonpharmacologic approaches such as behavior modification are not generally effective. Unlike in narcolepsy, where scheduled naps can be beneficial, daytime naps in patients with idiopathic hypersomnolence are typically long and nonrestorative. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2521197907\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic approaches are derived from experience with medications to treat excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) associated with narcolepsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73910\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73910 \">table 5</a>); supporting data in idiopathic hypersomnia are limited to case reports, retrospective series, and one small randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/3,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22-25</a>]. Treatment options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=armodafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">armodafinil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a>, and amphetamines. Of these, we suggest modafinil as first-line therapy, in part because it has a better side effect profile than other stimulants.</p><p>A typical starting dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a> is 200 mg once each morning (to reduce the initial chance of headache), increasing if necessary within several days to 200 mg each morning and again at midday, or to 400 mg each morning. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=armodafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Armodafinil</a> is started at 150 mg each morning and can be increased to 250 mg. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of narcolepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Daytime sleepiness'</a>.)</p><p>The effectiveness of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a> was demonstrated in a small randomized trial of 33 patients with idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Patients treated with modafinil 100 mg twice daily for 21 days, in comparison with placebo, had improved Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and clinical global impression rating scores. Headache and gastrointestinal distress were the most common side effects attributed to modafinil, and were reported in 26 and 20 percent of patients, respectively. The utility of modafinil was also illustrated by a multicenter cross-sectional study of 104 patients with idiopathic hypersomnia and 126 patients with narcolepsy, all treated with modafinil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In the subset of 63 idiopathic hypersomnia patients who completed the ESS before and after treatment, the mean improvement in the ESS score was 2.6 points, which was similar to that observed in narcolepsy patients. Forty-eight percent of patients reported at least one adverse effect, the most common being nervousness or irritability (14 percent), palpitations or tachycardia (13 percent), and headache (11 percent).</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-oxybate-gamma-hydroxybutyrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sodium oxybate</a> is a metabolite of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) that is used in patients with narcolepsy to treat cataplexy and EDS, but it has not been well studied in patients with idiopathic hypersomnia. Anecdotally, small numbers of patients treated with this agent have benefited from its tendency to render patients highly alert upon awakening in the morning. In a retrospective study of 46 patients with idiopathic hypersomnia treated with sodium oxybate, 71 percent of patients reported improvement in morning sleep inertia, one of the more disabling and difficult symptoms of idiopathic hypersomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Approximately half of patients stopped the drug due to side effects, most commonly nausea, dizziness, and headaches, a rate similar to that seen in patients with narcolepsy.</p><p>Additional therapies are under investigation. As an example, limited data suggest that compounded preparations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flumazenil</a>, a GABA type A receptor antagonist, may benefit some patients with unexplained daytime sleepiness of central origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a retrospective single-center series of 153 patients with refractory hypersomnolence due to idiopathic hypersomnia (24 percent), obstructive sleep apnea (23 percent), or other disorders, compounded sublingual or transdermal flumazenil was associated with sustained improvement in subjective sleepiness in 39 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The most commonly reported adverse effects were dizziness (13 percent), anxiety or other mood disturbance (13 percent), and headache (7 percent); one patient developed elevated liver function enzymes requiring discontinuation of drug. These preliminary data are encouraging and suggest that controlled studies of flumazenil are warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H691813939\"><span class=\"h2\">Counseling and follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with idiopathic hypersomnia should be counseled to avoid activities that may be dangerous at home or at work.

Most patients, two-thirds in one series of 77 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and three-quarters in another series of 42 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-hypersomnia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], experience good, sustained improvement with medication. However, responses can be variable and often less than those observed in patients with narcolepsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2247991\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic hypersomnia is a sleep disorder that is characterized by chronic excessive daytime sleepiness, an irrepressible need to sleep or daytime lapses into sleep, and in some cases difficulty waking up from nocturnal sleep or daytime naps. The underlying pathophysiology is not well understood, and diagnosis requires exclusion of other more common causes of excessive sleepiness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-excessive-daytime-sleepiness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic hypersomnia is a rare disorder, with a prevalence estimated at 20 to 50 per million. The mean age of symptom onset is 17 years and the mean age of diagnosis is 30 years. (See <a href=\"#H29343726\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The typical patient with idiopathic hypersomnia is an adolescent or young adult who complains of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), prolonged but unrefreshing naps, prolonged nocturnal sleep time, and great difficulty awakening from sleep. (See <a href=\"#H29343740\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Idiopathic hypersomnia is largely a diagnosis of exclusion that is achieved by a thorough history, probing for symptoms suggestive of other common causes of EDS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F86811\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86811 \">table 4</a>), and a nocturnal polysomnogram followed by a multiple sleep latency test. (See <a href=\"#H29343747\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2247436\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The disorders most commonly considered in the differential diagnosis of idiopathic hypersomnia include narcolepsy, sleep-related breathing disorders, hypersomnia associated with psychiatric disorders, and chronically insufficient nocturnal sleep. (See <a href=\"#H2247265\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment approaches are derived from experience with medications used to treat EDS associated with narcolepsy. Pharmacologic therapies that may have some benefit in patients with idiopathic hypersomnia include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=armodafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">armodafinil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a>, and amphetamines. Of these, we suggest modafinil as first-line therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H29343761\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">American Academy of Sleep Medicine.
