It is most commonly asymptomatic and an incidental finding. MAC tends to be more prominent with aging, although other underlying processes, such as atherosclerosis, altered mineral metabolism, or increased mechanical stress, promote development of MAC. In advanced cases, MAC may be significant, causing obstruction of left ventricular inflow and symptomatic mitral stenosis. Cohort studies have demonstrated an association of MAC with atherosclerotic disease and adverse cardiovascular events, including stroke and increased mortality. Additionally, there is an association of MAC with arrhythmia, including atrial fibrillation and conduction system disease.</p><p>The diagnosis, clinical significance, and associated cardiovascular risk of MAC and management of MAC-related disorders are discussed here.</p><p>Echocardiography of the MV, MV disease, and conduction system disease are discussed separately.

At the base of the left ventricle, the annulus is a C-shaped segment of the fibrous skeleton. The MV leaflets are suspended from the mitral annulus, which provides structural support to the valve apparatus along the medial, posterior, and lateral aspects of the valve. Anteriorly, the midsection of the anterior mitral leaflet is in fibrous continuity with the posterior aortic root via the intervalvular fibrosa, without intervening annular tissue. In systole, normal mitral annular contraction is along the anteroposterior plane, resulting in folding along the mediolateral plane with a reduction in annular cross-sectional area, and facilitation of leaflet coaptation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Three-dimensional echocardiography studies in patients with MAC have shown a relative loss of annular systolic motion, resulting in a larger, flatter annulus in systole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mitral annular calcification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MAC is characterized by progressive calcium deposition along and beneath the MV annulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. MAC generally follows the C-shape of the mitral annulus, so the base of the anterior mitral leaflet is relatively spared. Sparing of the mitral leaflet commissures and anterior leaflet distinguishes MAC from rheumatic mitral disease. Calcification of the mitral annulus is readily seen by echocardiography, appearing as a bright echodense region adjacent to the posterior atrioventricular groove (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70235\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70235 \">image 1A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80124\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80124 \">image 1B</a>). Echocardiographic features of MAC are described below.

Echocardiographic features are described below. (See <a href=\"#H3029894424\" class=\"local\">'Caseous calcification'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2473390124\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data on the pathophysiology of MAC are limited. Initially thought to be a passive, degenerative process, MAC is now understood to be a more active process, akin to atherosclerosis and calcific aortic valve disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There is a strong association between atherosclerotic risk factors and valve calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>MAC is thought to be initiated by endothelial disruption at foci of increased mechanical stress at the junction between the mitral valve (MV) annulus and ventricular myocardium. Focal accumulation of oxidized lipids serves as a nidus for chronic inflammatory cell infiltrates including T lymphocytes and macrophages, as well as activated mast cells that promote extracellular matrix remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Focal calcific deposits in regions of microinjury and lipoprotein accumulation may then coalesce over time into the dense, fibrotic, rigid band macroscopically evident as MAC. Conditions with increased mitral annular stress, such as those with higher left ventricular systolic pressure (aortic stenosis or systemic hypertension) or higher leaflet tension (MV prolapse), are associated with MAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Like atherosclerosis and calcific aortic valve disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], MAC is associated with systemic markers of inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In individuals with coronary heart disease, presence of MAC was inversely associated with serum fetuin A, a multifunctional glycoprotein that inhibits dystrophic calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a report from the Cardiovascular Health Study, of 5888 participants, 3585 participants had inflammatory, lipid, and mineral biomarker data available, measured within five years of echocardiography. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF-23) was positively associated with MAC with a relative risk (RR) of 1.040 (95% CI 1.004-1.078), and fetuin A was negatively associated with an RR of 0.989 (95% CI 0.911-0.989) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, the observed association between MAC and systemic inflammatory markers may be due to shared risk factors. In a report from the Framingham Heart Study, valvular calcification including MAC was associated with elevated levels of inflammatory markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The association was no longer significant after adjusting for accompanying cardiovascular disease risk factors.</p><p>Development of MAC also reflects systemic disorders of tissue mineralization. Among patients with end-stage renal disease, MAC was associated with an elevated calcium-phosphate product [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. In individuals with coronary heart disease without severe kidney disease, presence of MAC is inversely associated with serum fetuin A, a multifunctional glycoprotein that inhibits dystrophic calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Serum fetuin A is also inversely associated with valvular calcification (including MAC) in dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Other contributing factors for earlier development of MAC (in adolescence or young adulthood) include connective tissue abnormalities and genetic abnormalities of the fibrous skeleton, such as Marfan syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>], and systemic disease associated with chronic inflammation, such as systemic lupus erythematosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In an investigation of the potential genetic contribution to valve calcification, genomewide associations with MAC (detected by computed tomography scanning) were identified among 3795 participants from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms, rs17659543 and rs13415097, near <em>IL1F9</em>, a proinflammatory gene, reached significance (p&lt;1.5x10<sup>-8</sup>) for MAC, but the findings could not be reliably replicated in independent cohorts. Genomewide associations with aortic valve calcification in this study were stronger, with results replicated in independent cohorts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">General</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given that MAC is usually asymptomatic, overall prevalence of MAC is underestimated in the general population. In data from cohorts with mean age in the range of 50 to 60 years, prevalence of MAC was 3 to 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/13,25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,25-28</a>].

In the multiethnic Northern Manhattan study cohort of 1955 subjects (mean age 68 years) without prior myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke, MAC was identified in 27 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].<strong> </strong>In two population-based studies of older patients, mean ages of 70 and 76 years, respectively, the prevalence of MAC was 14 percent (by M-mode echocardiography) and 42 percent (by two-dimensional echocardiography) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. The prevalence of MAC increases significantly with older age. The Euro Heart Study survey showed among age groups 60 to 70 years, 70 to 80 years, and over 80 years, MAC accounted for 10, 30, and 60 percent of mitral stenosis cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>There are conflicting data on whether the prevalence of MAC is higher in women than men, as observed in some populations such as the Framingham Heart Study and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/28,29,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29,31,32</a>], or is similar in women and men, as noted in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study and the Cardiovascular Health Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/13,26,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,26,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with altered mineral metabolism, including those with chronic renal disease, MAC is more prominent with accelerated progression. In patients with end-stage renal disease, prevalence of aortic and mitral annular valvular calcification is reported in the range of 35 to 50 percent despite a relatively younger age range (mean age of 50 to 60 years old) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/18,19,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,34</a>].

Cystatin C levels (another marker of renal insufficiency) were also associated with MAC (OR 1.12) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Increased serum phosphate has also been associated with aortic valve calcification, aortic annular calcification, and MAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>In an analysis of data from the MESA study on 6785 participants, MAC was present in 8 percent of the participants with eGFR &ge;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> (mean age 62 years) but increased to 20 percent of participants with a lower eGFR &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> (mean age 70 years).

From the Framingham Heart Study cohort, of 3047 participants available for analysis, 284 participants (9.3 percent) had <span class=\"nowrap\">valve/annular</span> calcification. Of these, 20 percent had chronic renal insufficiency compared with just 7 percent in those without valve calcification. After adjustment for atherosclerotic risk factors, those with chronic renal insufficiency had a 60 percent increased likelihood of MAC (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.03-2.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MAC is typically asymptomatic, identified as an incidental finding in patients undergoing diagnostic imaging such as chest radiography, chest computed tomography, fluoroscopy, or echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].

Limited data are available on prevalence of calcific MS. In a study of 100 patients &ge;62 years old with MAC, a mean mitral gradient of at least 5 mmHg and a calculated MV area (MVA, by pressure half-time [PHT] method) of &le;1.8 cm<sup>2</sup> were found in 6 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Similarly, an MVA (by PHT method) &lt;2 cm<sup>2</sup> was found in 8 percent of patients in a smaller study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>However, these data may underestimate the true prevalence of MAC-associated MS given that MVA calculated by the PHT method tends to overestimate MVA (and therefore underestimate severity of MS) in patients with MAC due to concurrent abnormalities such as decreased LV compliance, which is frequently present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

A report from the Framingham Heart Study with 16 years of follow-up of 1126 subjects found that MAC was an independent predictor of incident AF (adjusted hazard ratio 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The association between MAC and incident AF was attenuated after adjustment for left atrial size, so the relationship between MAC and AF may be partially mediated through left atrial enlargement. Among 6641 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), there was a strong association between MAC and AF, with higher risk for development of AF in patients who had progression of MAC severity across several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MAC is significantly associated with coronary artery disease as detected by radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], coronary CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/27,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,59</a>], or invasive coronary angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-62</a>].

After taking into account demographics and other risk factors, the prevalence ratio of MAC in those with mild coronary artery calcification (1 to 99) was 2.13 (95% CI 1.69-2.69) but increased to 7.57 (95% CI 5.95-9.62) for coronary artery calcification &gt;400. This association weakened but persisted after adjustment for age, gender, and other traditional cardiovascular risk factors, suggesting that MAC presence is an indicator of atherosclerotic burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>MAC is also associated with atherosclerosis of the aorta, independent of cardiovascular risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/13,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,63</a>].

Endocarditis lesions have included MV leaflet vegetations and, less commonly, vegetations adherent to MAC, as well as paravalvular abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. These observational studies suggest that vegetations adherent to MAC are associated with greater comorbidity (eg, diabetes mellitus and cancer) and poor clinical outcome with high in-hospital mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. A single-center retrospective review of echocardiographic studies in 56 patients with native MV endocarditis determined that <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>was the culprit in 28 patients and streptococcal species in 17 patients. When <em>S. aureus</em> was the infecting organism, the vegetation was adherent to MAC in 57 percent of cases. By contrast, streptococcal infections more predominantly affected the valve leaflets, suggesting that MAC may act as a nidus for infection, particularly for <em>S. aureus</em> infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

TEE detected an abscess in 48 percent of those with an abscess. The majority (61 percent) of missed abscesses were localized to the posterior mitral annulus, which was frequently calcified.

If echocardiography and CT findings are indeterminate for caseous calcification, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) may be helpful. For symptomatic patients with severe MAC for whom the severity of MS is uncertain, cardiac catheterization with hemodynamic assessment can be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3146074556\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echocardiography enables identification of MAC, evaluation of MV anatomy and valve hemodynamics, and identification of concurrent conditions.

MAC is most commonly an incidental finding on echocardiographic imaging and is characteristically identified on parasternal and apical views of the left heart with acoustic shadowing of structures beyond (posterior to) the calcification. Although MV leaflets and chordae tendineae are generally not involved, calcification may progressively accumulate in the subvalvular region beneath the posterior leaflet with encroachment on the leaflet and into the myocardial wall. </p><p>Severity of MAC is typically reported qualitatively, with calcification of less than one-third of the annulus graded as &quot;mild&quot; and greater than two-thirds graded as &quot;severe.&quot; The thickness of the calcific band can also be measured via M-mode imaging from the parasternal long-axis view. MAC thickness correlates with cardiovascular risk.

On echocardiography, caseous calcification is less echodense than typical MAC, a central echolucent zone is present, and acoustic shadowing is absent. The caseous contents of the mass have a putty-like consistency with microscopic features consistent with liquefaction necrosis with amorphous eosinophilic acellular material surrounded by macrophages and lymphocytes and multiple small calcifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Limited longitudinal observations indicate that caseous calcification may be a dynamic condition. Caseous calcification may spontaneously resolve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>] or convert to typical MAC, and typical MAC may rarely convert to caseous calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Caseous calcification should not be misdiagnosed as a myocardial abscess, tumor, or thrombus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1708760699\"><span class=\"h3\">Evaluation of mitral stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MAC rarely progresses to the point of significant obstruction to LV inflow and calcific MS. When calcific MS is suspected, the MV gradient and the MV area (MVA) should be assessed. In contrast to rheumatic MS where inflow obstruction is at the leaflet tips, calcific MS obstruction in MAC is at the level of the mitral annulus.</p><p>The diastolic mean gradient across the MV is obtained from the continuous wave Doppler envelope. Spectral Doppler interrogation of the MV from the apical views of the heart provides hemodynamic data on functional restriction of LV inflow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F86969\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86969 \">image 3</a>). As with stenosis due to leaflet disease, transmitral gradients depend on the length of the diastolic filling period, cardiac output, severity of any associated MR, as well as the severity of obstruction. Thus, measurement of MV gradient should be performed when the patient is not tachycardic. </p><p>MVA estimation in patients with MAC is challenging; options include three-dimensional (3D) planimetry, continuity equation (in selected cases), and proximal isovelocity surface area (PISA) calculation of the effective orifice area. Enface views of the mitral annulus by 3D imaging provide a detailed evaluation of the extent of calcification and allow for direct planimetry of the valve orifice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-74</a>]. Three-dimensional planimetry (usually requiring transesophageal echocardiography [TEE] for optimal image quality) is the preferred method to assess MVA, as the accuracy of direct planimetry using two-dimensional echocardiography is relatively limited due to shadowing from the calcific deposits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>If there is no aortic or mitral valve regurgitation or atrial fibrillation, MVA by continuity equation (using mitral and left ventricular outflow velocity time integrals) is an alternative to 3D planimetry (particularly if image quality is suboptimal for 3D planimetry) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/43,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,74</a>]. The PISA method is another option but is challenging to apply in the setting of calcific MS given difficulty in judging leaflet angles with bulky annular calcification. </p><p>Use of pressure half-time (PHT) for MVA calculation is less optimal in patients with MAC. MVA calculated by PHT tends to overestimate MVA due to frequently concurrent decreased LV compliance and increased LV filling pressure, as noted in the European Association of Echocardiography and American Society of Echocardiography guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/46,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,72</a>]. In a study comparing MVA by 3D echocardiography with MVA calculated by PHT and the continuity equation, MVA calculated by PHT was significantly larger than calculated by the continuity equation, while MVA by 3D echocardiography was comparable with the continuity equation calculation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3769638536\"><span class=\"h3\">Evaluation of mitral regurgitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Color Doppler imaging can aid in evaluating the mechanism and severity of concurrent MR, although transthoracic images of MR jets in the left atrium are frequently suboptimal due to acoustic shadowing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F86970\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86970 \">image 4</a>). The impact of such shadowing may be reduced by acquiring multiple views of the valve on transthoracic echocardiography, although in some cases TEE (in which the left atrium is closer to the transducer and therefore not obscured by MAC) may be helpful to better visualize the extent of regurgitation.

High spatial and temporal resolution of cardiac CT allows for accurate identification of the severity and extent of calcification. Gating of the CT scan to the electrocardiogram decreases artifact due to cardiac motion, improving image quality. Although both contrast and noncontrast CT studies can assess the extent of mitral calcification, contrast is needed to evaluate cardiac structures, such as MV leaflet calcification, involvement of the subvalvular apparatus, or extension of calcification to the myocardium. Cardiac CT imaging also allows for anatomic assessment of other cardiac structures, including coronary arteries and the aorta, but does not allow for hemodynamic assessment of valve function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-annular-calcification/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>CT is helpful for distinguishing caseous calcification from other types of cardiac mass.
