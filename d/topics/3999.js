In one study, the incidence of adrenal crisis was similar in patients with primary (8 percent) and secondary (6 percent) causes of adrenal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3511240732\"><span class=\"h2\">Major precipitating factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As suggested by its occurrence in both causes of adrenal insufficiency, both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid deficiency can participate in the development of adrenal crisis. The physiologic basis for this is the ability of aldosterone or synthetic mineralocorticoid to promote sodium retention as well as to enhance vasoconstrictor responses of the vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, adrenal crisis can occur in patients who are receiving physiologic or even pharmacologic doses of synthetic glucocorticoid if their mineralocorticoid requirements are not met [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Glucocorticoid deficiency can contribute to hypotension by causing decreased vascular responsiveness to angiotensin II and norepinephrine, decreased synthesis of renin substrate, and increased prostacyclin production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>There is almost always an acute stressor or cause of adrenal insufficiency in patients with adrenal crisis.

In most patients, the blood pressure is low, but some have only postural hypotension. These symptoms are primarily due to volume depletion resulting from aldosterone deficiency. Serum concentrations of endothelin-1, a vasoconstrictive peptide, and of adrenomedullin, a vasodilator peptide, are reported to be increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].

Glucocorticoids are necessary for adrenal medullary epinephrine synthesis, and patients with adrenal insufficiency have decreased serum epinephrine and compensatory increases in serum norepinephrine concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. This may cause slightly lower basal systolic blood pressure and an exaggerated increase in pulse rate in response to upright posture.</p><p>Blood pressure control improves in patients with preexisting hypertension.

It is a consequence of cortisol deficiency and is due to increased production of proopiomelanocortin, a prohormone that is cleaved into the biologically active hormones ACTH, MSH, and others. The elevated MSH results in increased melanin synthesis, causing hyperpigmentation. In humans, melanin is synthesized in epidermal melanocytes lying just below the basal cells of the epithelium.</p><p>The resulting brown hyperpigmentation is generalized but is most conspicuous in areas exposed to light (such as the face, neck, and backs of hands) and areas exposed to chronic friction or pressure (such as the elbows, knees, spine, knuckles, waist [belt], midriff [girdle], and shoulders [brassiere straps]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74922\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74922 \">picture 1</a>). Pigmentation is also prominent in the palmar creases, where it escapes being worn away by friction, and in areas that are normally pigmented, such as the areolae, axillae, perineum, and umbilicus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/28,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,34</a>]. However, since pigmentation of the palmar creases may be normal in darker-skinned individuals, comparison with other family members and the presence or absence of additional abnormal pigmentation should be considered when evaluating this sign.</p><p>Other patterns of hyperpigmentation include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patchy pigmentation on the inner surface of lips and the buccal mucosa along the line of dental occlusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56401\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56401 \">picture 2</a>).

Recovery is due to keratinization and then sloughing of the pigmented basal layer of the epidermis. Fading of hair and nails takes longer because the pigmented part of the hair shaft or nail grows out slowly, and scars never fade because the melanin is trapped in fibrous connective tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4114449515\"><span class=\"h3\">Auricular-cartilage calcification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcification of the auricular cartilages may occur in longstanding primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults/abstract/30,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,43,44</a>].
