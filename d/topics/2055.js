Educating bipolar patients about their illness can improve adherence to treatment and the course of illness. The word &ldquo;doctor&rdquo; is derived from the Latin verb <em>docere</em>, which means to teach. </p><p>This topic reviews psychoeducation and other adjunctive maintenance psychotherapies for preventing or delaying recurrent bipolar mood episodes. Choosing maintenance treatment (including pharmacotherapy) for bipolar disorder is discussed separately.

The subtypes of bipolar disorder include bipolar I and bipolar II. Patients with bipolar I disorder experience manic episodes, and nearly always experience hypomanic and major depressive episodes. Bipolar II disorder is marked by at least one hypomanic episode, at least one major depressive episode, and the absence of manic episodes. Additional information about the clinical features and diagnosis of bipolar disorder is discussed separately.

In addition, adjunctive psychotherapy is typically administered to euthymic patients during maintenance treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Psychoeducation is a core element of adjunctive cognitive-behavioral therapy, family therapy, and interpersonal social rhythm therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Evidence supporting the use of adjunctive psychotherapy for maintenance treatment of patients with bipolar disorder includes randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. As an example, a meta-analysis of eight trials compared adjunctive psychotherapy (eg, psychoeducation or cognitive-behavioral therapy) with treatment as usual in 532 patients, and found that psychotherapy reduced the risk of relapse (relative risk 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Although adjunctive psychoeducation for bipolar disorder can be administered in an individual format (one therapist with one patient) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], we generally utilize a group format. Group psychoeducation has been studied more often than individual psychoeducation, and multiple randomized trials indicate that adding group psychoeducation to pharmacotherapy for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder is beneficial (see <a href=\"#H88286907\" class=\"local\">'Evidence of efficacy'</a> below). By contrast, a meta-analysis of three randomized trials (n = 252) compared adjunctive individual psychoeducation with usual care and found that relapse was comparable for the two groups (relative risk 0.81, 95% CI 0.64-1.02) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/8,9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,12</a>]. </p><p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is not a standard psychotherapy for preventing or delaying recurrent bipolar mood episodes; the benefit of adjunctive CBT is not clear due to conflicting results across randomized trials. (See <a href=\"#H18409684\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> below.) </p><p>Psychotherapies administered through the internet have been developed as add-on maintenance treatments for bipolar disorder (see <a href=\"#H1359317578\" class=\"local\">'Electronic resources'</a> below); however, we generally do not use this approach. Rather, we typically prescribe face-to-face psychotherapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88286585\"><span class=\"h1\">GROUP PSYCHOEDUCATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Group psychoeducation for bipolar disorder is a simple intervention that is relatively easy to implement in most clinical settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The therapy does not have a highly developed theoretical background and is thus readily comprehended by most patients, does not require complex or long training for clinicians, and targets the limited specific goals of empowering patients through knowledge to care for themselves and avoid recurrent mood episodes. A variety of formats have been studied, including groups that consist only of patients with bipolar disorder, as well as groups that include both patients and caregivers. Use of group psychoeducation is consistent with multiple treatment guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88286907\"><span class=\"h2\">Evidence of efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple randomized trials indicate that adjunctive group psychoeducation can delay or prevent recurrent bipolar mood episodes and hospitalizations in patients receiving pharmacotherapy, and that the benefits persist over time: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of five randomized trials (367 remitted patients) that compared group psychoeducation with a control condition, relapse was less likely with adjunctive psychoeducation than the control condition (odds ratio 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of two randomized trials (166 remitted patients) that compared group psychoeducation with nonspecific support (which controlled for attention), relapse occurred less often with group psychoeducation (relative risk 0.8, 95% CI 0.6-0.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The largest study was a 21-week trial that compared group psychoeducation with a nonspecific support group as add-on treatment in bipolar patients who were euthymic for at least six months (n = 120) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Both groups met weekly for 90 minutes. Patients were followed for up to two years after treatment, during which relapse occurred in fewer patients who received psychoeducation than nonspecific support (67 versus 92 percent). Follow-up assessments for up to five years after treatment found that the average number of recurrences per patient was lower in the group that received psychoeducation rather than nonspecific support (four versus eight) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, psychoeducation led to fewer hospitalizations per patient. Subgroup analyses in patients with bipolar II disorder (n = 20) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] and in patients with comorbid personality disorders (n = 37) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] also found that psychoeducation was superior to nonspecific support. </p><p/><p>Subsequently, a relatively large study compared group psychoeducation with an active comparator and found no advantage for patients receiving group psychoeducation. A 21-week trial randomly assigned patients with bipolar disorder who were euthymic for at least four weeks (n = 304) to either group psychoeducation plus pharmacotherapy or unstructured peer support plus pharmacotherapy; both groups met weekly for two hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Patients were followed for up to 96 weeks after study entry, during which the rate of relapse was comparable for adjunctive group psychoeducation and unstructured peer support (58 and 65 percent of patients). However, prespecified analyses that examined number of prior mood episodes as a moderator found that among patients with relatively few prior episodes (one to seven), time to relapse was longer with group psychoeducation than unstructured peer support (hazard ratio 3.6, 95% 1.5-8.3), suggesting that group psychoeducation may be more effective early in the course of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In addition, the results of this trial and the one described immediately above suggest that group psychoeducation may be better suited for patients who have been euthymic for a longer period of time (eg, six months rather one month). &#160; </p><p>Group psychoeducation that involves only caregivers of bipolar patients can also reduce recurrences. A randomized trial compared group psychoeducation with a control condition in euthymic bipolar patients (n = 113) treated with pharmacotherapy, who were living with a caregiver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Caregivers in the experimental group attended 12 weekly group psychoeducation sessions, each lasting 90 minutes; patients did not attend the groups. The control condition provided no specific intervention. During the one-year follow-up, recurrent mood episodes occurred in fewer patients in the experimental group than the control group (42 versus 66 percent).</p><p>Health care expenses also appear to decline for patients treated with group psychoeducation, commensurate with reductions in recurrent mood episodes and hospitalizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Group psychoeducation also maintains and improves adherence to medications.

Patients may thus have a predominantly painful life experience of learned helplessness (&ldquo;No matter what I do, I will relapse&rdquo; or &ldquo;I will never get a job or get married&rdquo;) that limits their functioning and quality of life. </p><p>Psychoeducation attempts to increase patient comprehension of the disorder, alleviate stigma and guilt, and prevent learned helplessness. The goal is to replace denial of the illness with awareness, guilt with responsibility, and helplessness with proactive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Patients learn that psychiatry already understands situations that may cause shame and isolation. Through psychoeducation, patients &ldquo;know that we know,&rdquo; which may improve the therapeutic relationship. </p><p>Patients are encouraged to adopt a proactive attitude in dealing with bipolar disorder, through acknowledging the need for proper training. It is not necessarily true that &ldquo;patients are experts in their own condition&rdquo;; although patients live with the condition, they nevertheless require certain types of knowledge they may lack. </p><p>However, patient education goes beyond information. Although knowledge about the disorder is a key element of psychoeducation, merely transmitting information may have little therapeutic effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Rather, psychoeducation is an information-based behavioral training program aimed at assisting patients to adjust their lifestyle to cope with bipolar disorder and improve outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Patients are empowered with tools (eg, enhanced treatment adherence and early detection of relapse) that allow them to be more active in their treatment and self-manage the illness. &#160;</p><p>We encourage clinicians to provide group psychoeducation early in the course of illness. In a randomized trial that found group psychoeducation was superior to a nonspecific support group in delaying recurrence of bipolar mood episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], a subgroup analysis found that the benefit occurred in patients with a lifetime history of six or fewer mood episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

In addition, group psychoeducation may be better suited for patients with relatively few prior mood episodes (eg, one to seven), as well as patients with less comorbidity (eg, anxiety disorder or substance use disorder) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/10,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,23,24</a>]. It is also preferable to balance groups with regard to gender. If possible, patient ages should be homogeneous enough such that members feel they belong and can model behavior for one another, but heterogeneous enough to allow patients to learn from each other. It is also desirable to balance bipolar subtypes, because patients with bipolar II disorder may be less likely to adhere to the group program due to discomfort with several issues relevant to patients with bipolar I disorder (eg, forced hospitalization or psychosis). This discomfort may lead to denial and disengagement. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Closed group structure</strong> &ndash; Psychoeducation groups are closed, meaning that after the first group session, new members are not allowed to join. <strong> </strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Size</strong> &ndash; The optimal size of a psychoeducation group is between 8 and 12 patients.

Patients generally accept the medical model of bipolar disorder quickly (see <a href=\"#H603369907\" class=\"local\">'Medical model'</a> above), which may help them cope with stigma and guilt, enhance acceptance of the illness, and ultimately improve treatment adherence.

Patients often have erroneous information about their medications (eg, &ldquo;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> will destroy my kidneys&rdquo;) or the need for ongoing maintenance treatment (eg, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had an episode for months and don&rsquo;t need the medications&rdquo;). One common fear is the risk of becoming dependent upon psychopharmacologic agents; therapists should state that psychotropic drugs for bipolar disorder are not addictive, except for benzodiazepines if improperly used. Therapists should also explicitly state that psychotropic medications do not &ldquo;brainwash&rdquo; or cause &ldquo;idiocy&rdquo; (both fears are frequently expressed by patients), and that most medications are neither sedatives simply intended to keep patients quiet, nor stimulants that replace the will of patients who take them. </p><p>Another issue is the social stigma associated with psychotropic drugs.

Patients construct one list of symptoms that herald oncoming <span class=\"nowrap\">hypomania/mania</span> and a separate list for oncoming depression. An early warning sign should be a specific behavior, operative, different from the usual behavior, subtle, easy to recognize, and well known to the patient. Each list consists of approximately 10 items. The process is based upon the general principle that early prodromal symptoms are idiosyncratic to each patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In addition, these lists should be more sensitive than specific, and may thus generate false alarms (false positives).</p><p>Patients are asked to check these lists daily and implement an emergency plan if a few (eg, three or more) early warning signs are present. The emergency plan includes contacting clinicians, and it is useful for patients to have contact telephone numbers on hand. </p><p>In addition, patients can also be taught to use preventative behavioral and cognitive techniques when warning signs occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/4,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,28</a>]. For prodromal signs of mania or hypomania, it may be helpful for patients to limit their activities and avoid stimulating substances. Suggested responses to prodromal signs of depression include exercising, avoiding daytime sleep, and maintaining one&rsquo;s usual level of activity despite feeling lethargic. Negative, maladaptive thoughts that occur as a prodrome to depression (eg, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no good&rdquo; or &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my fault that the project failed&rdquo;) can be ameliorated by questioning their validity, examining the evidence for them, and discussing alternative, rational explanations for the situation that prompted the dysfunctional thoughts. &#160;</p><p>Additional information about detecting prodromal signs is discussed elsewhere in this topic.

Psychoeducation encourages patients towards healthy habits, particularly with regard to sleeping habits and social rhythms; sleeping and social rhythm disruptions may have mood-destabilizing effects. The general advice is as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sleeping habits</strong> &ndash; Sleep between seven to nine hours each night, arise at the same time each day, avoid daytime sleep, and use sleep as an aid to deal with oncoming mood episodes that are foreshadowed by prodromal signs.

Detecting early warning signs is one element of group psychoeducation, and is often part of other psychotherapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and family therapy. A meta-analysis of six randomized trials (n = 690 bipolar patients) compared interventions that included identifying early warning signs with usual care, and found that time to recurrence was longer with detecting early warning signs (hazard ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>In addition, learning to recognize early warning signs can be used on its own without the additional elements of other psychotherapies. Evidence for using early warning signs alone includes a randomized trial that tested an intervention in which bipolar patients were trained to identify manic and depressive prodromes and seek early treatment; the intervention was administered individually over 7 to 12 sessions, each lasting one hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Patients (n = 69) were assigned to the intervention plus usual care or usual care alone, and assessments were conducted 18 months after randomization.

Cognitive therapy attempts to modify automatic dysfunctional thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes (eg, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no good&rdquo;); behavioral therapy focuses upon modifying problematic behavioral responses to environmental stimuli or dysfunctional thoughts through techniques such as stimulus control and exposure with response prevention. In addition, CBT may also include educating patients about bipolar disorder and teaching coping skills for psychosocial stressors.

One such intervention consists of a group program that includes 21 weekly sessions (each lasting 90 minutes) that address neurocognitive problems with attention, memory and executive functioning (eg, planning, decision making, and response inhibition), as well as daily functioning in domains such as interpersonal relationships, occupational functioning, finances, and leisure time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. </p><p>Evidence supporting the use of adjunctive functional remediation includes a 21-week trial that randomly assigned euthymic bipolar patients with moderate to severe functional impairment (n = 239) to one of three treatments: pharmacotherapy plus functional remediation, pharmacotherapy plus psychoeducation, or pharmacotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Both adjunctive treatments were administered weekly in a group format. Improvement of psychosocial functioning posttreatment was greater with adjunctive functional remediation, compared with pharmacotherapy alone, and the clinical advantage was small to moderate. In addition, there was a trend for greater improvement among patients who received functional remediation, compared with patients who received psychoeducation. Follow-up assessments six months posttreatment found that functioning was superior with adjunctive functional remediation, compared with either pharmacotherapy alone or adjunctive psychoeducation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Verbal memory also improved more with functional remediation than the other two treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1359317578\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTRONIC RESOURCES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although multiple internet-based psychological interventions (eg, psychoeducation) for bipolar disorder have been developed, there is little to no evidence that these therapies are efficacious for preventing recurrences of mood episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bipolar-disorder-in-adults-psychoeducation-and-other-adjunctive-maintenance-psychotherapies/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. The appeal of administering psychotherapy through computers and mobile telephones that are connected to the internet includes improved access, decreased costs, and anonymity. In addition, these electronic resources may enable patients to monitor their mood and behavior, and to receive real time information and advice tailored to their specific needs. However, randomized trials of various programs have generally found these web based, self-help programs are not efficacious for maintenance treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2786146779\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The subtypes of bipolar disorder include bipolar I and bipolar II. (See <a href=\"#H603369786\" class=\"local\">'Definition of bipolar disorder'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis#H4503550\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychotherapies that are used as adjunctive maintenance treatments for bipolar disorder include psychoeducation, detecting early warning signs, and family therapy. Psychoeducation is a core element of family therapy. (See <a href=\"#H88286386\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple randomized trials indicate that adjunctive group psychoeducation can prevent or delay recurrent bipolar mood episodes and hospitalizations, and that the benefits of treatment persist over time. (See <a href=\"#H88286907\" class=\"local\">'Evidence of efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient education goes beyond information; psychoeducation is an information-based behavioral training program aimed at assisting patients to adjust their lifestyle to cope with bipolar disorder and improve outcomes. Patients are empowered with tools that allow them to be more active in their treatment and self-manage their illness. We encourage clinicians to provide group psychoeducation early in the course of illness. (See <a href=\"#H88286591\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapists for group psychoeducation should have experience treating bipolar patients and leading therapy groups, and training in social skills and bipolar group psychoeducation. The role of therapist can be served by psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, or social workers. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is preferable to enroll euthymic patients, particularly patients who have been euthymic for relatively longer periods of time. However, it is acceptable to include patients who are mildly ill and reasonably stable. In addition, group psychoeducation may be better suited for patients with relatively few prior mood episodes, as well as patients with less comorbidity. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Psychoeducation groups are closed, meaning that after the first group session, new members are not allowed to join. The optimal size of a psychoeducation group is between 8 and 12 patients. The number of sessions provided in studies of group psychoeducation programs has varied from 6 to 21. Sessions last approximately 90 minutes. (See <a href=\"#H88286939\" class=\"local\">'Administering treatment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main topics covered in group psychoeducation include illness awareness, medication options and adherence, identifying prodromal signs of recurrent mood episodes, and regulating habits. Other potential topics include factors that trigger mood episodes, course of illness, avoiding substance abuse, pregnancy and heritability, ineffective alternative therapies, stress management, and problem solving. (See <a href=\"#H88286597\" class=\"local\">'Content'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other adjunctive psychotherapies that may help prevent recurrences of bipolar mood episodes include cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia, and healthy lifestyle interventions. (See <a href=\"#H3361524184\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1765037399\" class=\"local\">'Healthy lifestyle'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjunctive psychotherapy can be used during maintenance treatment for purposes other than preventing recurrent mood episodes. As an example, functional remediation may improve cognitive impairment and psychosocial functioning. (See <a href=\"#H346572183\" class=\"local\">'Functional remediation'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">American Psychiatric Association.
