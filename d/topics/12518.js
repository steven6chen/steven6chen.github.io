However, the chloride concentration of 0.9% sodium chloride is much higher than that of plasma because the solution contains no bicarbonate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sodium concentration of LR (130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> is lower than that of blood.

For example, Plasma-Lyte's sodium concentration is 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. Plasma-Lyte also contains potassium and magnesium as well as acetate, a buffer that is converted to bicarbonate independent of the liver. </p><p/><p>Depending upon the solution chosen, recipients of a large volume of intravenous crystalloid fluid may develop hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and dilutional electrolyte deficiency (ie, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis &ndash; Large volume 0.9% sodium chloride resuscitation generates a hyperchloremic acidosis and renal vasoconstriction, both of which contribute to unpredictable water retention and electrolyte derangement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In many cases, acidosis can be avoided with the use of a solution containing less chloride than 0.9% sodium chloride, such as LR or Plasma-Lyte. However, balanced salt solutions are more expensive than LR, and LR has a subphysiologic sodium concentration (130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> which may result in hyponatremia when given in excess. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postoperative fluid therapy in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyponatremia &ndash; During and after surgery, surgical stress results in the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH; ie, vasopressin). Antidiuretic hormone acts in the kidney to retain water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In normovolemic postsurgical patients, the administration of additional sodium (ie, 0.9% sodium chloride) can result in a paradoxical fall in sodium concentration because the sodium contained in these solutions is excreted in the urine, resulting in net retention of electrolyte-free water. As a result, hyponatremia is commonly observed in postsurgical patients. It can also occur if too much LR or a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=balanced-salt-solution-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">balanced salt solution</a> is administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Mild postoperative hyponatremia generally resolves without specific intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/1,2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4</a>]. As the stress response dissipates and antidiuretic hormone secretion is suppressed by the low serum sodium concentration, the excess free water is excreted in the urine. If the serum sodium does fall below normal, the administered intravenous fluid should be changed to one with a higher sodium concentration (eg, from LR to 0.9% sodium chloride) to avoid worsening hyponatremia and its complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postoperative fluid therapy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, moderate or severe hyponatremia can occur. It is particularly common and worrisome in patients with brain injury (see <a href=\"#H2182165277\" class=\"local\">'Brain injury'</a> below), but it has also been reported after minor elective surgical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In most cases, postoperative patients with hyponatremia related to the administration of hypotonic fluids will respond to isotonic or hypertonic fluids without event. In one review, the prevalence of hyponatremia &lt;130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> during the first postoperative week was 4.4 percent (48 of 1088 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Most patients (94 percent) were receiving hypotonic fluids (eg, hypotonic sodium chloride or dextrose infusion); however, none of the patients had significant neurologic deterioration. Although uncommon, seizures and even fatal cerebral edema have been reported in postoperative patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. If the serum sodium concentration rapidly falls below 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> (eg, in the first 24 hours after surgery) and the patient has symptoms that might be attributable to the acute hyponatremia, the electrolyte disturbance should be evaluated and emergently treated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of hyponatremia in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypokalemia &ndash; In addition to ADH release in response to surgical stress, aldosterone is released in response to hypotension or hypovolemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65116\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65116 \">figure 1</a>). It acts in the kidney to retain sodium and waste potassium. The degree of this hormonal response for a particular patient or type of surgery is highly variable, as is the degree of associated electrolyte derangement. Although intravascular volume is restored, potassium levels are unpredictably affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This process is compounded by the administration of supernormal sodium doses with intravenous fluid therapy during and after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypokalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1308284435\"><span class=\"h3\">Transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effects of transfusion on the development of postoperative electrolyte abnormalities depend upon the amount given, the clinical status of the patient, the temperature of the blood when it is transfused, and the duration of blood storage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. Hyperkalemia may be observed after the transfusion of red blood cells. As stored red blood cells age, they lyse, leaking potassium into the extracellular fluid. In this way, older banked blood tends to contain more extracellular potassium. When citrate, a red blood cell additive, is administered, it may result in the chelation of serum electrolytes, resulting in hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, or hypomagnesemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Banked red blood cells exist in an anaerobic environment, leading to the production and accumulation of lactic acid. The transfusion of red blood cells provides an acid load of approximately 15 mEq per unit, the sum of the citric acid anticoagulant and red blood cell lactic acid production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In the normal individual, the acid load of banked blood can be adequately accommodated by metabolic and respiratory mechanisms. However, when red blood cells are transfused rapidly or in a large volume, profound electrolyte derangement is often observed in conjunction with acid-base disorder. This is further exacerbated when the product is not warm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in adults: Storage, specialized modifications, and infusion parameters&quot;, section on 'Potassium leakage'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-blood-transfusion#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive blood transfusion&quot;, section on 'Complications of citrate infusion'</a>.)</p><p>To a lesser extent, this also applies to autologous blood transfusion, which may be used during resuscitation in the trauma bay, intensive care unit, or operating room. Rapidly lost blood is collected, washed, and returned to the patient promptly. The washing process reduces the potassium and lactate content in the sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Conditioning older banked blood using similar autotransfusion technology has also been shown to decrease its potassium and lactate content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

This process is informally known as &quot;third spacing&quot; into the soft tissues, peritoneal cavity, or pleural cavity. As the patient recovers, the capillary leak resolves, and the fluid returns to the vascular space. Electrolyte deficits (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia) tend to follow this process in an unpredictable manner. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults#H4005841940\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postoperative fluid therapy in adults&quot;, section on 'Third-spacing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3209440946\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastrointestinal loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The compositions of various bodily fluids are given in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107239\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107239 \">table 2</a>).<strong> </strong>Loss of a sufficient volume of fluid that is not adequately replaced can lead to electrolyte abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postoperative-fluid-therapy-in-adults#H2501608345\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postoperative fluid therapy in adults&quot;, section on 'Fluid resuscitation'</a>.)</p><p>Postoperative ileus or intestinal obstruction is commonly observed in surgical patients and may lead to vomiting that requires nasogastric drainage. The loss of a large volume of gastric fluid, which contains hydrochloric acid, can lead to intravascular volume contraction, metabolic alkalosis, hypochloremia, and hypokalemia. The loss of fluid volume stimulates aldosterone production, which promotes water retention and potassium wasting in the kidney. To produce more acid, the stomach pumps additional bicarbonate into the serum. This excess bicarbonate is excreted in the urine as an unabsorbed anion that obligates excretion of potassium to maintain electrolyte neutrality. </p><p>The pancreas generates a bicarbonate-rich fluid. When pancreatic fluid is lost externally, as with a pancreatico-cutaneous fistula following pancreatic injury (accidental or surgical), it generates a metabolic acidosis as well as secondary derangements in potassium.</p><p>High-volume diarrhea, ostomy output, or enterocutaneous fistula drainage leads to unpredictable electrolyte derangements, including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32700399\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinary loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As the patient recovers from surgery, fluid returns to the vascular space and is evacuated by the kidneys. The mobilization of third-space fluid results in large-volume auto-diuresis, which is associated with potassium and magnesium wasting. Although there is no firm relationship that describes the volume of urine and expected level of electrolyte derangement, it is the author's experience that urinary outputs that exceed <span class=\"nowrap\">30mL/kg/day</span> during auto-diuresis are typically associated with deficits of potassium, magnesium, or phosphorus. When auto-diuresis is associated with recovering renal dysfunction, such as that which resulted from an obstructing kidney stone or hypovolemia-induced acute kidney injury following hemorrhage, this electrolyte wasting can be exaggerated. </p><p>Brain injury (accidental or surgical) can lead to diabetes insipidus (DI), syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH), and cerebral salt wasting, which are associated with electrolyte derangements. In DI, uncontrolled water loss leads to hypernatremia. In SIADH and cerebral salt wasting, hyponatremia may result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Hyponatremia in head-injured patients can be highly problematic as it contributes to cerebral edema. Hypotonic fluids should not be administered to head injury or neurosurgery patients at risk for cerebral edema. In some cases, hypertonic 3% sodium chloride and vasopressin receptor antagonists are needed to manage SIADH-associated hyponatremia in head-injury patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hyponatremia-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh-and-reset-osmostat\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hyponatremia: Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and reset osmostat&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Similarly, hyponatremia from disordered ADH production may be observed in liver-failure patients awaiting transplantation. These patients have a higher risk of morbidity, mortality, and worse survival after transplantation. The management of hyponatremia of liver failure differs from that of head-injury-associated SIADH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-liver-failure-in-adults-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute liver failure in adults: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Following renal transplantation, allograft recovery often includes a phase of uncontrolled diuresis during which hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia commonly occur. Similarly, when a native kidney obstruction is relieved (eg, laser lithotripsy for an obstructing ureteral stone), diuresis and electrolyte wasting may result.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2182165277\"><span class=\"h2\">Brain injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyponatremia is more commonly observed in patients with traumatic or surgical brain trauma. In a study of neurosurgery patients, hyponatremia was observed in 10 and 50 percent of patients, depending on the underlying condition. Accidental and surgical trauma to the brain more commonly result in the production of ADH, which leads to inappropriate fluid retention and dilutional hyponatremia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-the-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hyponatremia-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh-and-reset-osmostat\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hyponatremia: Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and reset osmostat&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H32700399\" class=\"local\">'Urinary loss'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2535452140\"><span class=\"h2\">Related to tissue injury/ischemia and reperfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanical tissue destruction and ischemia-induced tissue injury can cause tissue necrosis and cell lysis. The resulting cell injury may lead to the release of intracellular potassium into the bloodstream, causing profound hyperkalemia. With muscle injury, myoglobin is released into the circulation and can be nephrotoxic, further impairing potassium excretion. Phosphate released from cells leads to hyperphosphatemia and may also lead to calcium scavenging and hypocalcemia. When associated with significant muscle injury, these electrolyte disturbances are referred to collectively as part of a syndrome termed rhabdomyolysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-rhabdomyolysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of rhabdomyolysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Creatine kinase (CK) is often used as a biochemical marker of muscle damage. In general, increases in CK less than five times the normal value are unlikely to cause significant electrolyte abnormalities. However, the degree of CK elevation used to define rhabdomyolysis remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. </p><p>Surgical trauma (ie, planned muscle division) results in muscle injury. Surgical patients can also experience muscle compression injury if improperly positioned in the operating room or if subjected to a prolonged period of immobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Patient positioning may also promote muscle ischemia by interrupting anatomic blood flow (eg, stirrups) or by compression (eg, pressure from security belts when patient is rotated into a lateral position). Generally, positions maintained for under two hours are unlikely to cause significant injury. However, patient factors, particularly obesity, may contribute to increased pressure, thereby leading to unanticipated muscle injury during shorter procedures, which has been demonstrated in a number of surgical populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Extremity injury (eg, crushed limb, electrical shock, open femur fracture) commonly leads to muscle injury and some degree of rhabdomyolysis. When crushed limbs are released from a crushing object, reperfusion may result in rapid-onset hyperkalemia and acidosis. Extensive bone and muscle injury with severe extremity injury often results in compartment syndrome, which, when released, can lead to rhabdomyolysis-induced renal failure and metabolic derangements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Acute tissue ischemia, such as in cases of thromboembolism to an extremity, can result in extensive muscle ischemia prior to limb salvage surgery. In such cases, rhabdomyolysis and its associated electrolyte abnormalities are commonly observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Blood flow to an extremity may be purposefully interrupted with a tourniquet or clamp for short periods of time to prevent blood loss during a planned surgery (eg, arm tourniquet during carpal tunnel release). Release of the <span class=\"nowrap\">tourniquet/clamp</span> can also be associated with reperfusion of ischemic tissue. However, in such controlled settings, it is uncommon for this to result in significant electrolyte abnormalities unless the ischemia time is longer than usual. </p><p>Ablative or embolic procedures, such as for liver tumors, also result in acute tissue ischemia. With tumor ablation, rarely, a tumor lysis syndrome may be observed. Tumor lysis syndrome is well described in case reports in patients who undergo transarterial chemoembolization of large liver tumors, although &quot;large&quot; is not well defined. In these cases, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia may be observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

As malnourished patients recover from surgery and resume dietary intake, they are at risk for refeeding syndrome, a collection of electrolyte derangements associated with a massive intracellular shift of electrolytes. Hypophosphatemia is commonly observed as extracellular phosphate is rapidly taken into the cells to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP). </p><p>Hypokalemia and hypocalcemia are also commonly observed. Malnourished patients should be closely monitored for clinical and laboratory evidence of refeeding syndrome when their nutritional intake is resumed.

The classic scenario is the patient with a bowel obstruction who undergoes laparotomy, <span class=\"nowrap\">during/after</span> which aggressive third-spacing of fluid into the peritoneal cavity and intestinal lumen leads to volume contraction. Emesis and nasogastric tube decompression lead to further large-volume loss of hydrochloric acid (HCl). As the stomach produces more HCl to replace this loss, it delivers bicarbonate (HCO3<sup>-</sup>) into the serum. In this manner, volume contraction and HCl loss generate a hypochloremic hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. There is a very small amount of potassium in gastric fluid that is directly lost during vomiting and gastric tube decompression as well. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic acidosis &ndash; This may result from large-volume blood loss and under-resuscitation. The commonly observed scenario is the patient with hemorrhagic shock from large surgical blood loss, which leads to reduced end-organ perfusion and lactic acidosis. This generates a &quot;gap&quot; acidosis. Conversely, a patient who undergoes a large volume of 0.9% sodium chloride infusion may experience hyperchloremic acidosis associated with the large chloride load.

For patients with ongoing losses, the author targets the middle of the normal range, to prevent complications of electrolyte deficiency. </p><p>Because commercial metabolic panel assays vary from one hospital to the next, leading to inconsistent &quot;normal range&quot; values, it is important for the clinician to be familiar with the normal range for their lab. There is no agreed-upon definition of what constitutes mild, moderate, or severe electrolyte deficiency. In general, if an electrolyte value falls within 25 percent of its normal value for a given lab, that would be considered a mild-to-moderate deficiency by the author. For levels falling more than 25 percent below the normal value, that would be considered a severe deficiency.

To obtain an accurate level in the setting of enteral replacement, wait at least one hour after the dose is given to ensure complete absorption of the enteral dose prior to rechecking the serum potassium level. A common practice is to obtain a daily chemistry panel in the morning, which allows for the prescription and administration of potassium during the day. For mild derangements in the absence of ongoing loss, it is common to await the potassium level the following day before administering further potassium.

Due to gradual redistribution of magnesium to tissue following intravenous administration, levels are not repeated until 8 to 12 hours or more after the dose. The regimen is repeated until the serum magnesium reaches the middle of the normal range. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A common practice is to obtain a daily magnesium level in the morning, which allows for the prescription and administration of magnesium during the day.

We prefer measurement of ionized (ie, fraction unbound to plasma proteins) rather than total calcium (bound plus unbound) because it is a better indicator of functional calcium capacity in postoperative patients. In most cases, acute hypocalcemia is treated with intravenous therapy, and calcium <strong>gluconate</strong> is the preferred form for nonemergency replacement. For mild-to-moderate hypocalcemia (level is within 25 percent of the normal value), 1 or 2 grams (2.3 or 4.6 mmol) of IV calcium gluconate is typically given. The dose may be repeated after six hours based upon ionized calcium level. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For severe (level below 75 percent of normal) or symptomatic hypocalcemia, calcium <strong>chloride</strong>, which provides three times the amount of elemental calcium per gram (as compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a>), is preferred. An initial dose of 1 g IV calcium <strong>chloride </strong>(6.8 mmol) or calcium gluconate 3 g (6.9 mmol) is given initially for symptomatic hypocalcemia and repeated as necessary. Concentrated calcium solutions (especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium chloride</a>) are extremely caustic to tissues and should be administered in a central vein to avoid tissue extravasation. If greater than 4 g (9.2 mmol) of calcium gluconate is administered, consider repeating the serum ionized calcium level before administering further replacement therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Uncommonly, oral calcium is used in conjunction with intravenous calcium, such as in patients with hypocalcemia following parathyroidectomy; in such a case, standing oral calcium doses are titrated up slowly with as-needed doses of intravenous calcium until the serum calcium normalizes.

In symptomatic or severe hypophosphatemia (level below 75 percent of normal), an initial dose of 30 mmol IV sodium phosphate is given. Phosphate homeostasis is dependent upon kidney function; for patients with significant renal impairment (creatinine clearance [CrCl] &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute),</span> the phosphate dose should be reduced by 50 percent or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. For moderate-to-severe derangement or during monitoring for refeeding syndrome, the serum phosphate level should be repeated two to four hours after the intravenous dose is completed. Individuals at risk for developing severe hypophosphatemia and refeeding syndrome (eg, malnourished, anorectic, alcoholic) require very close monitoring (ie, check serum phosphate level every 6 to 12 hours). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with normal gut function, oral phosphate replacement (typically a mix of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-phosphate-and-sodium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium phosphate-sodium phosphate</a>) dose should be approximately tripled to equal the intravenous dose. As an example, 15 mmol intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium phosphate</a> may be converted to oral therapy as 16 mmol oral potassium phosphate-sodium phosphate administered for three doses. Bioavailability of enteral phosphate supplementation is variable, and it can cause diarrhea. Commonly used enteral phosphate supplements include 250 mg (equivalent to 8 mmol) of phosphate per tablet.

In patients with severe hypophosphatemia and normal renal function, a maximum rate of 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/hour</span> has been used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-hypophosphatemia#H3136551\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of hypophosphatemia&quot;, section on 'Intravenous dosing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Oral phosphate replacement is typically given in three or four divided doses through the day. Consider repeating the phosphate level after administering 45 or 60 mmol of oral phosphate (eg, with morning labs). Note that oral phosphate supplements include variable amounts of sodium and potassium. One commonly available phosphate tablet preparation (K-Phos Neutral) delivers 13 mEq sodium and 1.1 mEq potassium in a fixed ratio with 8 mmol of phosphate. Additional detail on oral products is available in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-phosphate-and-sodium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium phosphate-sodium phosphate</a> drug monograph included within UpToDate.

The treatment for electrolyte excess in surgical patients is similar to that of medical patients. However, surgical patients are often not candidates for enteral therapies as they recover from surgery. Factors known to aggravate the electrolyte excess should be avoided (eg, hyperkalemic patient should not receive LR solution, which contains potassium; hyperphosphatemic patients should take a renal diet that is low in phosphate content). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperkalemia and hypercalcemia &ndash; For surgical patients with acute kidney injury and severe hyperkalemia, <span class=\"nowrap\">enteral/rectal</span> sodium polystyrene therapy may not be an option, and emergency dialysis may be the best treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypercalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypercalcemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperphosphatemia &ndash; In most cases, hyperphosphatemia in the postoperative surgical patient is related to rhabdomyolysis from accidental or surgical trauma. Less commonly, it is observed in tumor lysis syndrome as well as acute on chronic renal failure associated with surgical disease. Enteral phosphate binders may not be an option. However, acute hyperphosphatemia is rarely life-threatening; emergency dialysis is not usually needed.

Minor elevations of sodium are easily corrected by decreasing the sodium content of the intravenous fluid (eg, switch from 0.9% sodium chloride to 0.45% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose in water) or by adding free water to enteral feeds. (See <a href=\"#H2100206582\" class=\"local\">'Crystalloid fluids'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-enteral-nutrition#H34\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Enteral nutrition&quot;, section on 'Fluid/water'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Caution is advised in using the urine output alone in this assessment in patients with head injury, who may suffer from diabetes insipidus (DI). In cases of head injury, mild permissive hypernatremia is helpful in avoiding cerebral edema; in such cases, little to no correction is warranted. However, when correction is employed, fluid adjustment may be part of a broader approach to therapy, including the administration of vasopressin or receptor therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-postoperative-electrolyte-abnormalities/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2363705982\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Excess urinary loss can occur with auto-diuresis during recovery from surgery or head trauma. The patient's underlying medical condition prompting the surgery and treatment of other medical conditions may also contribute to electrolyte derangement. (See <a href=\"#H3680371306\" class=\"local\">'Etiologies of postoperative electrolyte abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperative patients with the following conditions and treatments should have their electrolytes monitored on a daily basis; more frequent monitoring may be indicated in cases of electrolyte deficiency or excess (see <a href=\"#H3582693484\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory monitoring'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fluid resuscitation </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blood transfusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe organ dysfunction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Traumatic brain injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Continuous bladder irrigation </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abnormal bodily fluid losses </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Large surface area open wounds or burns</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Maintenance fluid therapy in patients who are not eating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Postoperative ileus or bowel obstruction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Total parenteral nutrition</a></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To avoid complications of electrolyte deficiency in the postoperative period (eg, ileus, arrhythmia, seizure), electrolyte deficiencies should be identified and treated. Electrolyte replacement to a goal of normal serum electrolyte levels (as defined for a particular institution) is a safe practice. For the patient with ongoing losses, target the middle of the normal range. (See <a href=\"#H1857148488\" class=\"local\">'Electrolyte replacement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrolyte deficiencies can be replaced using the intravenous or enteral route. One or the other route of administration may be more appropriate depending upon the clinical situation. Although an enterally administered replacement is preferred for those with gut function, these may be poorly tolerated in postoperative patients. For patients with moderate-to-severe electrolyte deficiency, intravenous administration provides reliable and rapid delivery. The amount and rates of administration are reviewed above. (See <a href=\"#H3996505789\" class=\"local\">'Route'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrolyte excess in postoperative patients is often related to the underlying disease for which surgery was indicated and its treatment. Enteral options for treatment may not be feasible in postoperative patients.
