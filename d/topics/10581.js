However, this disorder can cause serious morbidity. The management of neonatal thrombosis, excluding the central nervous system (CNS), is reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of this disorder and CNS thromboembolic disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of thrombosis in the newborn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-in-the-newborn-classification-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stroke in the newborn: Classification, manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newborns are at risk for thrombosis because of the unique characteristics of their coagulation and fibrinolytic system as compared with older age groups, and also because of triggers such as indwelling catheters. Because these risk factors usually are transient, the recurrence risk is low. Therefore, the primary goals of treatment in this age group is to prevent further extension of the clot, which can result in end-organ damage. Rarely, a neonate has a chronic condition that predisposes to thrombosis, such as neonatal purpura fulminans; in this case, long-term prophylaxis is needed. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal purpura fulminans'</a> below.)</p><p>The management of neonatal thrombosis is extrapolated largely from data in adults. Little information is available on management strategies or the efficacy and safety of therapeutic agents in the neonatal age group. The approach to an individual infant must balance the risks and benefits.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For <strong>asymptomatic</strong> thrombosis, we suggest supportive care and close monitoring of the size of the thrombus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This approach avoids development of bleeding complications that may be associated with anticoagulant or fibrinolytic therapy. If the thrombus is associated with a central venous line (CVL) or umbilical venous catheter, the catheter should be removed. If the thrombus extends, we suggest treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Alternatively, initial treatment with anticoagulant is a reasonable option, particularly when it is not feasible to remove the catheter due to the patient's clinical condition.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For <strong>symptomatic</strong> thrombosis, we suggest treatment with anticoagulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibrinolytic agents. However, these strategies have not been studied in clinical trials, and data on outcome in neonates are sparse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The management of less severe events also is uncertain. CVLs or umbilical venous catheters associated with thrombosis should be removed, if possible, immediately or after three to five days of anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Though there is a theoretical risk of embolism with immediate catheter removal (ie, before anticoagulation), anecdotal evidence and clinical experience suggests this is uncommon. If a central catheter is still in place on completion of therapeutic anticoagulation, we suggest treatment with a prophylactic dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) until the device is removed. (See <a href=\"#H3165802012\" class=\"local\">'Dose'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral arterial catheters associated with thrombosis should be removed promptly. If the thrombosis is symptomatic, anticoagulation therapy should be initiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal duration of therapy is uncertain. In general, the duration of anticoagulation therapy is from six weeks to three months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The safety and efficacy data related to the use of LMWH or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">unfractionated heparin</a> (UFH) are based on reference ranges for activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) or anti-factor Xa levels that were established in older age groups; the therapeutic range for neonates has not been established in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>Surgical thrombectomy rarely is performed in newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In general, this procedure is limited by the small size of blood vessels and the clinical instability of newborns with thrombosis.</p><p>Decisions about thrombolytic therapy in newborns should ideally be made by a multidisciplinary team that includes surgeons who are familiar with ischemic tissue changes. The parents should also be fully informed about the therapeutic options and risks, and involved in the decision-making process.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BASELINE TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before antithrombotic therapy is initiated, baseline coagulation testing should be performed.

It is especially important for preterm infants, who are at increased risk of developing an intracranial hemorrhage. During anticoagulant treatment, the platelet count should be maintained at <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;50,000/microL,</span> and fibrinogen concentration should be &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=germinal-matrix-hemorrhage-and-intraventricular-hemorrhage-gmh-ivh-in-the-newborn-pathogenesis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Germinal matrix hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH) in the newborn: Pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=germinal-matrix-hemorrhage-and-intraventricular-hemorrhage-gmh-ivh-in-the-newborn-prevention-management-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Germinal matrix hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH) in the newborn: Prevention, management, and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Choices for anticoagulant therapy in the newborn include low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">unfractionated heparin</a> (UFH). In most cases, we suggest LMWH rather than UFH because LMWH has a more predictable pharmacokinetic response, requires less laboratory monitoring and dose adjustment, is administered subcutaneously (and therefore does not require a dedicated intravenous [IV] catheter), and probably has reduced risk of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia and osteoporosis. The mechanism of action and general pharmacology of these drugs are discussed in greater detail a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-and-lmw-heparin-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heparin and LMW heparin: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4198178454\"><span class=\"h2\">Low molecular weight heparin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LMWHs have many advantages over UFH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. These include greater bioavailability when given by subcutaneous injection, longer duration of anticoagulant effect, and clearance that is independent of dose, which results in a more predictable response. They can be administered subcutaneously and require minimal laboratory monitoring and dose adjustment; these are important for newborns with poor venous access. Other potential advantages are the reduced risk of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia and osteoporosis.</p><p>Because LMWH has a relatively predictable and stable anticoagulation response, we suggest using LMWH over UFH for treatment of neonatal thrombosis, provided that an assay of anti-factor Xa activity (required to monitor the anticoagulation effect of LMWH) is readily available. In clinical settings in which an assay of anti-factor Xa activity cannot be performed with results available within one to two days, UFH should be considered. The physicians' familiarity with the anticoagulant also is an important consideration in choosing LMWH versus UFH.</p><p>Based on limited information, LMWH appears to be safe and effective in newborns. One prospective cohort study included 173 children who were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">enoxaparin</a> because they had or were at high risk for thromboembolic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients ranged in age from 1 day to 18 years; 21 (14.5 percent) were &lt;36 weeks gestational age and 48 (33.5 percent) were less than three months postnatal age when treatment was initiated. Thrombi resolved clinically in 94 percent of patients who received therapeutic doses. In those receiving prophylaxis, 96 percent had no symptoms of new or recurrent thromboembolic events. Major bleeding occurred in seven (4 percent) patients, of whom four were newborns.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3165802012\"><span class=\"h3\">Dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several LMWH preparations and they should not be used interchangeably [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

A nomogram has been developed for dose titration of LMWH in children (see enoxaparin drug information). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For <strong>prophylaxis</strong>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">enoxaparin</a> is initiated at 0.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose twice each day.

The dose of protamine sulfate depends upon the dose of LMWH and the time since LMWH was administered last. If LMWH was given within four hours, the maximum dose of protamine is 1 mg per 100 units LMWH, given by slow IV push. If LMWH was given more than four hours previously, a lower dose of protamine should be used. However, protamine only partially neutralizes the effects of LMWH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1605075963\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal duration of therapy is uncertain. The usual duration is six weeks to three months. Our approach is to monitor the thrombus with ultrasound and continue therapy until the thrombus has resolved and the patient is entirely asymptomatic. If the thrombus was related to a CVL, then the CVL should also be removed before stopping therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If the thrombus does not resolve, the therapy should be continued for as long as three months, after which the anticoagulation is discontinued. An ongoing clinical trial is evaluating duration of anticoagulation (six weeks versus three months) in pediatric patients with thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Unfractionated heparin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UFH is an indirect thrombin inhibitor that complexes with AT (formerly known as AT III) and converts it from a slow to a rapid inactivator of thrombin, factor Xa, and, to a lesser extent, factors XIIa, XIa, IXa, and VIIa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The binding of AT to heparin is mediated by a unique pentasaccharide sequence that is distributed randomly along the heparin chains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The inactivation of thrombin, but not factor Xa, requires the formation of a ternary complex in which heparin binds to both AT and thrombin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F101832\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef101832 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This ternary complex (containing heparin, AT, and thrombin) forms only on pentasaccharide-containing chains with at least 18 saccharide units, which is true of most chains of UFH but is less common in LMWH, which therefore have less AT activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-and-lmw-heparin-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heparin and LMW heparin: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The advantages of UFH are its rapid reversibility and low cost. Disadvantages include its unpredictable pharmacokinetic response and resultant requirement for frequent monitoring.</p><p>Infusion of UFH in newborns requires a dedicated IV catheter. This avoids interruption of anticoagulation therapy by infusion of other medications and minimizes the risk of inadvertent flushing of the catheter that may lead to excessive anticoagulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dose of heparin therapy in newborns is based upon a prospective cohort study of UFH treatment in 65 children with thrombosis, of whom 29 were less than one year of age, including 13 newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Heparin is administered intravenously in a loading dose of 75 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> and an initial maintenance dose of 28 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per hour. The loading dose of heparin should be withheld or reduced if there are significant bleeding risks (eg, in an extremely low birth weight infant with septicemia and associated disseminated intravascular coagulation). Indeed, some clinicians are now omitting the initial bolus in most cases, due to preliminary data suggesting that aPTT can be markedly elevated after the bolus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>UFH dosing in the neonate should be titrated to both aPTT and anti-factor Xa activity. Significance of the clot and the potential risk of bleeding should also be considered when adjusting the UFH dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/1,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,26</a>]. We suggest titrating the dose of UFH to achieve an anti-factor Xa level of 0.35 to 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL,</span> and also an aPTT that is 1.5 to 2 times the upper limit of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The results of aPTT testing can be used to facilitate dose adjustments, but only after establishing the aPTT range that corresponds to the target anti-factor Xa levels in an individual patient. This contrasts to the approach to dose adjustment in adults, in whom the aPTT range can be used alone because this generally corresponds to an anti-factor Xa activity of 0.35 to 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The additional monitoring is necessary for neonates because they have an increased clearance rate of heparin compared with older children or adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, the efficacy of heparin may be reduced in newborns because the physiologic plasma concentration of AT is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>A series of 100 infants younger than six months of age who were treated with the heparin dosing and monitoring protocol outlined above illustrates the challenges of heparin therapy in young infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The median heparin dose needed to achieve target anti-factor Xa levels was 33 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per hour, and two-thirds of infants had decreased thrombus size and no thrombus progression. However, nearly 17 percent of the infants never achieved target anti-factor Xa levels despite up to 60 days of therapy and up to triple the recommended dose. Moreover, 11 percent of the infants had a major bleeding episode.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13664577\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal duration of therapy is uncertain. The usual duration is six weeks to three months.

In our practice, we generally switch to LMWH if treatment is needed for longer than two weeks.</p><p>If the thrombus extends, the heparin therapy may not be optimal. In this case, the dose of UFH can be increased. Alternatively, LMWH, which has a more predictable anticoagulant response, can be used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major side effects of UFH are bleeding, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The risk of bleeding in newborns is uncertain. As in adults, bleeding likely relates to the concentration of heparin as well as underlying disorders that would predispose to bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In one series, no bleeding occurred in 13 newborns given UFH for treatment of thromboembolic disease or prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, aPTT levels were subtherapeutic in most of these patients.</p><p>If bleeding occurs, UFH should be discontinued. If the bleeding is problematic, the effects of heparin can be reversed using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protamine-sulfate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">protamine sulfate</a> (1 mg of protamine sulfate can inactivate 100 units heparin). The dose of protamine depends upon the amount of heparin being given, and is calculated by assuming the half-life of heparin to be one hour.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22500112\"><span class=\"h4\">Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIT is a well-recognized complication of heparin therapy in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. Two major mechanisms cause this thrombocytopenia. One mechanism appears to be a direct effect of heparin on platelet activation. In most of these cases, the fall in platelet count occurs within the first two days after heparin initiation, often returns to normal with continued heparin administration, and is of no clinical consequence, at least in adults. The incidence of this type is estimated at 10 to 20 percent of adults receiving UFH. The second type is mediated by antibodies to a heparin-platelet factor 4 complex, which results in platelet activation and aggregation and enhanced generation of thrombin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

Heparin-associated antiplatelet antibodies were found in 14 patients; these patients had clinical characteristics comparable to the 20 infants without antibodies, including the presence of an umbilical artery catheter in all but one patient in each group. Among those who had abdominal ultrasonography, aortic thrombosis occurred in 11 of 13 (84 percent) infants with and 5 of 20 (25 percent) infants without antibodies. Bleeding was not observed. However, the sensitivity of ultrasound to detect an asymptomatic thrombus in newborns is poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Thus, the relationship between antibody formation and thrombosis in this population remains uncertain.</p><p>HIT should be considered in a newborn with thrombocytopenia of no apparent cause, although HIT is uncommon and other causes of thrombocytopenia occur frequently. In addition, experience with anticoagulants other than heparin is very limited in this age group. Thus, in most cases, heparin therapy should be continued, and the platelet count should be maintained by transfusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22500119\"><span class=\"h4\">Osteoporosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteoporosis has been reported in adult patients receiving UFH for more than six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Although cases of osteoporosis associated with heparin have been reported in children, there is no information on this complication in newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Warfarin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Warfarin</a> is an oral anticoagulant that should not be used in newborns because of the potential risk of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The effect of warfarin is caused by reduction of the functional plasma concentration of the vitamin-K dependent coagulation factors (factors II, VII, IX, and X). However, the concentration of these factors is physiologically reduced in newborns and often is similar to those of adults receiving warfarin therapy. Newborns also may have borderline levels of vitamin K, increasing the risk of warfarin-induced bleeding. Because human milk has low concentrations of vitamin K, breastfed newborns are especially sensitive to the effect of warfarin. On the other hand, infant formulas are supplemented with vitamin K, rendering formula-fed newborns relatively resistant to treatment.</p><p>Another problem with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">warfarin</a> administration in newborns is its availability only in tablet form.

Data on these agents in pediatric patients are extremely limited. Given the very limited evidence, we suggest <strong>not</strong> using these drugs for management of acute thrombosis in newborns. The only rationale for use of argatroban in newborns would be in patients judged to be at high risk of HIT, who require cessation of UFH or LMWH and continuous anticoagulation with non-heparinoid agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].

If such infants develop VTE, guidelines suggest continuing anticoagulant therapy beyond the usual three-month course, at either therapeutic or prophylactic doses, as long as the nephrotic syndrome persists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For infants who have not experienced VTE, the role of anticoagulant therapy (primary prophylaxis) has not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Decisions about treatment of such patients typically depend on severity of the nephrotic syndrome and the presence of other risk factors. As an example, the authors of this topic review would initiate primary prophylaxis for an infant with severe nephrotic syndrome and one or more other risk factors (eg, an inherited thrombophilia or central venous catheter). Patients with congenital nephrotic syndrome tend to have low antithrombin level and thus the dose of LMWH required to achieve an adequate anti-Xa level is substantially higher than is typically used (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">enoxaparin</a> 3 mg per kg per dose). In patients with renal failure, the dose of LMWH needs to be adjusted.

In the studies that reported long-term outcome, 20 percent of infants were hypertensive (27 of 140 patients), and 71 percent had evidence of irreversible renal damage (156 of 221 patients), including eight patients who required chronic renal replacement therapy (eg, dialysis and transplantation).</p><p>Another potential complication of neonatal thrombosis is post-thrombotic syndrome, a disorder characterized by edema and impaired viability of subcutaneous tissue in an extremity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The condition is caused by incompetent perforating valves, resulting in blood flow directed from deep to peripheral veins. This disorder has been recognized in children, although the incidence following venous thrombosis in newborns is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].

Because these risk factors usually are transient, the recurrence risk is low. Therefore, the primary goals of treatment in this age group is to prevent further extension of the clot, which can result in end-organ damage. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of neonatal thrombosis is extrapolated largely from data in adults. Little information is available on management strategies or the efficacy and safety of therapeutic agents in neonates. In general, asymptomatic thrombosis is managed by close monitoring of the size of the thrombus and by providing supportive care. Severe symptomatic thromboembolic events typically are treated with anticoagulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibrinolytic agents. Surgical thrombectomy rarely is performed in newborns. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before antithrombotic therapy is initiated, baseline coagulation testing should be performed, including activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio (INR), plasma fibrinogen concentration, platelet count, and cranial ultrasound examination. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Baseline testing'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For neonates with symptomatic thrombosis requiring therapy, we suggest low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">unfractionated heparin</a> (UFH) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Compared with UFH, LMWH has a more predicable response in neonates, requires less laboratory monitoring and dose adjustment, is administered subcutaneously (and therefore does not require a dedicated intravenous catheter), and probably has reduced risk of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia and osteoporosis. There are several LMWH preparations and they should not be used interchangeably (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64075\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64075 \">table 1</a>). By contrast, UFH is preferred over LMWH in patients with renal insufficiency. The major side effects of UFH and LMWH are bleeding, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and osteoporosis (See <a href=\"#H4198178454\" class=\"local\">'Low molecular weight heparin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Unfractionated heparin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend <strong>not</strong> treating neonatal thrombosis with thrombolytic therapy unless major vessel occlusion is causing critical compromise of organs or limbs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Fibrinolytic therapy should be undertaken with caution because of significant risks of major bleeding. In cases in which fibrinolytic therapy is indicated (because of critical compromise of organs or limbs) recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is the thrombolytic agent of choice. Contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy include recent or expected surgery or by a variety of other conditions. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Thrombolytic agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For neonates with unilateral renal vein thrombosis (RVT) without compromised renal function or extension into the inferior vena cava (IVC), either supportive care with close monitoring or anticoagulation therapy are acceptable options. If thrombosis progresses, there is extension into the IVC, or RVT is bilateral, we suggest anticoagulation rather than observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In patients with renal insufficiency, UFH is preferred over LMWH. If LMWH is used in patients with renal insufficiency, the dose should be reduced. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Renal vein thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right atrial thrombosis usually is associated with the use of central venous catheters and may compromise cardiac function or lead to pulmonary embolism. If possible, the catheter should be removed. We usually begin anticoagulation therapy with UFH or LMWH. We begin thrombolytic therapy with tPA if cardiac function is compromised. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Right atrial thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial thrombosis that causes significant impairment of blood flow to an extremity or vital organ should be treated with anticoagulation therapy with LMWH or UFH, and any associated arterial catheter should be removed. In conditions that are life-threatening or if the viability of a limb or organ is jeopardized, thrombolytic therapy with tPA should be given and surgical consultation should be obtained. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Arterial thrombosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal purpura fulminans is a rare life-threatening condition characterized by disseminated intravascular coagulation and hemorrhagic skin necrosis. It usually is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous deficiency in protein C or S. Early identification of the disorder and treatment with protein C replacement is essential to prevent serious morbidity and death. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal purpura fulminans'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-thrombosis-in-the-newborn/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Monagle P, Chan AK, Goldenberg NA, et al.
