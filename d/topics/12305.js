It can lead to symptoms of palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, or lightheadedness, as well as an increased risk of atrial thrombus formation that may cause cerebral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systemic embolization. &#160;</p><p>Atrial flutter occurs in many of the same situations as atrial fibrillation, which is much more common. Atrial flutter may be a stable rhythm or a bridge arrhythmia between sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation. It may also be associated with a variety of other supraventricular arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will summarize key points regarding the causes, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management approach to patients with atrial flutter. Other topics discuss management issues in detail.

That terminology is no longer used. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3566747094\"><span class=\"h2\">Typical atrial flutter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The designation of &quot;typical&quot; atrial flutter involves a macroreentrant circuit traversing the cavo-tricuspid isthmus (CTI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52904\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52904 \">figure 1</a>). This isthmus is the region of right atrial tissue between the orifice of the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid valve annulus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F89570\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89570 \">figure 2</a>). If this isthmus is involved, it is called &quot;typical&quot; atrial flutter. In fact, typical atrial flutter is also called CTI-dependent atrial flutter. The circuit is usually a counterclockwise rotation around the tricuspid valve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F89570\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89570 \">figure 2</a>), exhibiting a classic sawtooth appearance in the inferior electrocardiogram (ECG) leads (II, III, aVF) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F89571\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89571 \">image 1B</a>). If the circuit is clockwise, it is called &quot;reverse&quot; or &quot;clockwise&quot; typical flutter, exhibiting positive flutter waves in the inferior ECG leads (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F89576\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89576 \">image 1C</a>). <br/></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4100423800\"><span class=\"h2\">Atypical atrial flutter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the cavotricuspid isthmus is not suspected to be involved in the underlying mechanism, then it is called &quot;atypical&quot; atrial flutter. This type of flutter can involve any region of the right or left atria, around areas of scar tissue due to intrinsic heart disease or <span class=\"nowrap\">surgical/ablated</span> scar tissue. Surgical repair of congenital heart disease may lead to macroreentrant atrial flutter circuits, both typical (cavotricuspid isthmus dependent) and atypical. These circuits are usually right atrial, related to anatomic obstacles and surgical scars (cavotricuspid isthmus, right atriotomy scar, atrial septal defect repair, etc). Incomplete ablation lines created in attempts to cure atrial fibrillation with ablation can promote atypical atrial flutter circuits in the left atrium (mitral isthmus flutter, etc). Focal atrial tachycardias with atrioventricular block may also mimic atypical atrial flutter by ECG appearance, but by electrophysiologic study the focal mechanism can be differentiated from the macroreentry seen in atrial flutter. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28361313\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrial flutter is uncommon in the normal heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In a population-based study, lone<em> </em>atrial flutter with neither identifiable recent predisposing events nor chronic preexisting comorbidities occurred in only 3 of 181 patients (1.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The rate of lone atrial flutter was 8 percent in a series of 380 children and young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>A variety of other underlying conditions can predispose to the development of atrial flutter. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial flutter commonly occurs after initiation of an antiarrhythmic drug for the suppression of atrial fibrillation. It may occur in up to 15 percent of patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a>, and is also seen in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronedarone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any of the disorders that can cause atrial fibrillation, including thyrotoxicosis, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, sick sinus syndrome, pericarditis, pulmonary disease, and pulmonary embolism.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supraventricular-arrhythmias-after-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supraventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-arrhythmias-due-to-digoxin-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac arrhythmias due to digoxin toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial flutter can occur after cardiac surgery, both as a postoperative complication and as a late arrhythmia. The atrial flutter in these patients is re-entrant and may involve atypical isthmuses between natural barriers, atrial incisions, and scar, as well as the cavotricuspid isthmus, the site of involvement in typical atrial flutter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-and-flutter-after-cardiac-surgery#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation and flutter after cardiac surgery&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients develop atypical left atrial flutter after atrial fibrillation ablation. These arrhythmias may be due to circuits created by scar from left atrial (LA) ablations, but are often amenable to ablation themselves. This issue is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation-clinical-applications#H1228811936\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter ablation to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation: Clinical applications&quot;, section on 'Arrhythmic complications'</a>.)</p><p/><p>In the population-based study discussed above, 16 percent were attributable to heart failure and 12 percent to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Atrial flutter without an identifiable predisposing factor (&quot;lone&quot; atrial flutter) occurred in 1.7 percent. The incidence increased markedly with age, ranging from 5 per 100,000 person years under age 50 to 587 per 100,000 person years over age 80.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28361370\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the general population, the development of new onset atrial flutter is uncommon and occurs with significantly less frequency than atrial fibrillation.</p><p>Much of the information about atrial flutter has been derived from patients referred to tertiary care centers; as a result, the incidence of atrial flutter in the general population has been uncertain. This issue was addressed in a large database of 58,820 residents who obtained their care from one major medical center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The overall incidence of new cases of atrial flutter during a four-year period was 88 per 100,000 person-years, ranging from 5 per 100,000 in those less than 50 and 587 per 100,000 in those more than 80 years of age. Atrial flutter was 2.5 times more common in men. Based upon these data, it was estimated that the incidence of atrial flutter in the United States is 200,000 new cases per year.</p><p>The incidence of this arrhythmia, as with atrial fibrillation, is greatest when underlying heart disease is associated with left atrial enlargement, or left ventricular or biventricular failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/1,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28361462\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMODYNAMICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several hemodynamic changes occur with atrial flutter; many of these are consequent to the rapid atrial and ventricular rates. These changes include an increase in the mean right and left atrial pressures, a reduction in right and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures, a decrease in systolic blood pressure, and an increase in diastolic pressure. The cardiac index is generally unaltered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The reduction in left ventricular pressure is a result of the rapid heart rate, while the increase in atrial pressure is due, in part, to contraction against closed atrioventricular valves. The hemodynamic changes lead to the symptoms presented below. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'History and physical examination'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typical complaints include palpitations, fatigue, lightheadedness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mild shortness of breath. Less common problems include significant dyspnea, angina, hypotension, anxiety, presyncope, or infrequently, syncope. These symptoms are in large part attributable the rapid heart rate. (See <a href=\"#H28361462\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamics'</a> above.)</p><p>The purpose of the remainder of the history is to define the onset of the arrhythmia as well as its frequency and duration, the precipitating causes and modes of termination, the previous response to drug therapy, and the presence of heart disease or potentially reversible causes. (See <a href=\"#H28361313\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and risk factors'</a> above.) </p><p>The physical examination may reveal tachycardia, hypotension, diaphoresis, and evidence of congestive heart failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.) Occasionally, cardiac auscultation may reveal an irregular rhythm, abnormal valve sounds, or a gallop. </p><p>Flutter waves can be seen in the jugular veins at a rate consistent with the atrial rate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients in atrial flutter at the time of the electrocardiogram (ECG), it generally shows an atrial rate of about 300 beats per minute (range 240 to 340) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F89577%7ECARD%2F89571%7ECARD%2F89576\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89577 graphicRef89571 graphicRef89576 \">image 1A-C</a>). Typical P waves are absent, and the atrial activity is seen as a sawtooth pattern (also called F waves) in leads II, III, and aVF. There is typically 2:1 conduction across the atrioventricular (AV) node; as a result, the ventricular rate is usually one-half the flutter rate in the absence of AV node dysfunction. Even atrial to ventricular rate ratios (eg, 2:1 or 4:1 conduction) are much more common than odd ratios (eg, 3:1 or 5:1). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrocardiographic-and-electrophysiologic-features-of-atrial-flutter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrocardiographic and electrophysiologic features of atrial flutter&quot;</a>.) Odd ratios probably reflect bilevel block in the AV node. On the other hand, a 1:1 response suggests catecholamine excess, parasympathetic withdrawal, the presence of antiarrhythmic drug therapy with Class IA or IC agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56600 \">table 1</a>), or the existence of an accessory bypass tract. The ECG may also identify left ventricular hypertrophy, pre-excitation, bundle branch block, or prior myocardial infarction (MI). Overlapping flutter waves may complicate assessment of the QT interval, repolarization pattern, and even the presence of T waves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A transthoracic echocardiogram should be obtained in all patients with atrial flutter to evaluate the size of the right and left atria, the size and function of the right and left ventricles, and to detect possible pericardial or valvular heart disease or left ventricular hypertrophy. </p><p>Transthoracic echocardiography has a low sensitivity for detecting thrombus, and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is preferred for this purpose. TEE may play an important role in the selection of patients for cardioversion as it does in atrial fibrillation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-echocardiography-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of echocardiography in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise testing is sometimes useful to reproduce exercise-induced atrial flutter, to evaluate for associated ischemic heart disease, or to determine the maximum heart rate with exercise, which can help guide medical therapy. Holter monitoring or event recorders are used to identify the arrhythmia if symptoms are nonspecific, to identify triggering events, to detect associated atrial arrhythmias, and to determine average and peak heart rates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambulatory-ecg-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ambulatory ECG monitoring&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Serum electrolytes, renal and hepatic function, and pulmonary and thyroid function tests can be ordered when searching for predisposing causes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28361405\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of atrial flutter is almost always secured by the observation of a characteristic pattern on the electrocardiogram, which includes the presence of continuous, regular atrial electrical activity (depolarization and repolarization) at a characteristic rate of approximately 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> and a regular ventricular rate of about 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span> in patients not taking atrioventricular (AV) nodal blockers. If there are sawtooth negative flutter waves in the leads II, III, and aVF, it is typical atrial flutter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F89571\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89571 \">image 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Electrophysiologic classification'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176513794\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, the pattern of atrial activity on the electrocardiogram is not convincing for atrial flutter and raises the possibility of atrial fibrillation, other supraventricular arrhythmia, or even electrical artifact. If the latter has been excluded, an electrophysiology study is necessary to determine if the arrhythmia is atrial flutter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cardiac electrophysiology studies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-narrow-qrs-complex-tachycardias#H26225795\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of narrow QRS complex tachycardias&quot;, section on 'Types of narrow QRS complex tachycardia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28361513\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serious complications of atrial flutter include myocardial ischemia, dizziness or syncope, heart failure (with either preserved or reduced left ventricular systolic function), or embolization of clot. Control of the ventricular rate or reversion to normal sinus rhythm will improve or prevent the first three; anticoagulation is frequently used to decrease the risk of embolization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Anticoagulant therapy to prevent embolization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response is also an important cause of tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy. Control of the ventricular rate or reversion to normal sinus rhythm will improve many symptoms in these patients. Rate-control is critical to treat heart failure (HF) symptoms, but in patients with tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy, rate plus rhythm control may be more effective in improving symptoms. Effective treatment of atrial flutter, most commonly with ablation, frequently leads to improvement and sometimes normalization of left ventricular function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmia-induced-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL TREATMENT ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As is true for atrial fibrillation, there are four major issues that must be addressed in the management of atrial flutter:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Control of the ventricular rate </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reversion to normal sinus rhythm (NSR)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance of NSR</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of systemic embolization</p><p/><p>The following discussion will provide a brief summary of these four treatment issues, each of which is discussed in detail separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1997404\"><span class=\"h2\">Rate control in atrial flutter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rate control in atrial flutter, as in atrial fibrillation, usually involves the administration of a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker or a beta blocker. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Digoxin</a> is used less often because its major action is an enhancement of vagal tone, which is offset during exertion. The main indication is concurrent heart failure in which it is often given in combination with a beta-blocker. Rarely, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> may be used also as a rate control agent, but is not generally chosen due to the long-term risk of side effects. Ablation therapy of the atrioventricular (AV) node and pacemaker implantation (&quot;ablate and pace&quot; strategy) is rarely indicated, but is a treatment option in drug-refractory cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-flutter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial flutter&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, it is more difficult to effect rate control in atrial flutter, as compared to atrial fibrillation. While up-titration of AV nodal blocking agents typically gradually and continuously lower the mean rate in atrial fibrillation, patients with atrial flutter are frequently &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; at 2:1 A:V conduction. Intravenous (IV) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> may be effective in lowering the rate in acutely ill patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Reversion to NSR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the high rate of recurrence of atrial flutter in patients without a correctable cause, and because of its high success rate, radiofrequency catheter ablation is the definitive treatment. Many patients have sinus rhythm restored at the time of this procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial flutter: Maintenance of sinus rhythm&quot;, section on 'RF catheter ablation'</a>.)</p><p>For patients who will not undergo catheter ablation in the short term, synchronized internal or external direct current (DC) is preferred to antiarrhythmic drug cardioversion (using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disopyramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">disopyramide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibutilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibutilide</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dofetilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dofetilide</a>). Of the available agents, only ibutilide is specifically labeled for acute conversion of atrial fibrillation and flutter in the United States. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-flutter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial flutter&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If pharmacologic reversion is deemed necessary, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibutilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibutilide</a>, which is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration only for intravenous use, is the drug of choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It can revert atrial flutter to a sinus mechanism in approximately 60 percent of patients and is more effective than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. Ibutilide therapy carries a risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. One report noted an 8.3 percent incidence of torsades de pointes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Although the arrhythmia is usually not sustained, countershock was required for sustained arrhythmia in 1.7 percent. As a result, the use of ibutilide requires continuous monitoring, resuscitative equipment including a defibrillator, and personnel trained in the use of electrical cardioversion and resuscitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-use-of-ibutilide\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic use of ibutilide&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the setting of ventricular preexcitation, patients with atrial flutter and rapid ventricular rates should be treated with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibutilide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibutilide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a>, as is recommended in the treatment of AF with ventricular preexcitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=restoration-of-sinus-rhythm-in-atrial-flutter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Restoration of sinus rhythm in atrial flutter&quot;</a>.). Administration of intravenous adenosine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> (oral or intravenous), or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (oral or intravenous) in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who have pre-excited AF is potentially harmful because these drugs accelerate the ventricular rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. &#160; </p><p>Atrial overdrive pacing is another method to convert atrial flutter to sinus rhythm. The most frequent settings for this approach are patients with pre-existing permanent pacemakers where pacing can be performed via the programmer or following cardiac surgery when pacing via a temporary epicardial (atrial) wire can be performed. Of course, the usual precautions should be taken with regard to anticoagulation or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) if the duration of atrial flutter is beyond 24 to 48 hours or of unknown duration.</p><p>In the hemodynamically stable patient, watchful waiting may be sufficient since atrial flutter can be an unstable rhythm that reverts spontaneously to normal sinus rhythm. As in atrial fibrillation, the best candidate for an attempt at cardioversion has a left atrial size less than 4.5 to 5 cm, atrial flutter of recent onset, little or no heart failure, and an underlying reversible cause such as hyperthyroidism, myocardial infarction, and pulmonary embolism.</p><p>Rate control with an AV nodal blocker such as a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, beta blocker, or if the patient has heart failure or hypotension, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, should be attained before instituting class IA and IC drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56600 \">table 1</a>) because of the risk of rapidly conducted atrial flutter. These drugs can slow the atrial flutter rate, and in the absence of AV nodal blocking agents, lead to 1:1 A:V conduction and paradoxically faster rates than baseline flutter (generally with 2:1 A:V conduction). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronedarone</a> can also slow the atrial flutter rate, but rarely lead to 1:1 A:V conduction because they also slow AV nodal conduction. All of these agents can &ldquo;organize&rdquo; atrial fibrillation and lead to &ldquo;slow&rdquo; atrial flutter, with the risk of 1:1 A:V conduction as described.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintenance of NSR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of recurrence of atrial flutter is difficult to determine because most published data combine atrial flutter with atrial fibrillation. However, the recurrence rate is substantial. In one report, for example, 50 patients were followed for a mean of 3.5 years after cardioversion for chronic atrial flutter; prophylactic antiarrhythmic drugs were not given [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Sinus rhythm was maintained at six months and five years in 53 and 42 percent of patients, respectively. In a second study of 59 patients with lone atrial flutter, 75 percent developed recurrent or chronic atrial flutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-flutter-maintenance-of-sinus-rhythm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial flutter: Maintenance of sinus rhythm&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Antiarrhythmic drug mechanisms, as with atrial fibrillation, may suppress triggering atrial premature beats, which may require the use of class IA and IC drugs, beta blockers, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to prolong the atrial refractory period with class III drugs. </p><p>However, because of the high rate of recurrence in patients without a correctable cause, and because of its high success rate, radiofrequency catheter ablation is generally preferable to long-term pharmacologic therapy in patients with typical atrial flutter. The isthmus between the inferior vena cava and the tricuspid annulus (cavotricuspid isthmus) is an obligatory route for typical flutter, and, as such, is the preferred anatomic target for ablation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52904\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52904 \">figure 1</a>). This applies to the common counterclockwise circuit, as well as the less common clockwise circuit. A meta-analysis of 21 studies demonstrated an ablation success rate for a single procedure of 91.7 percent and for multiple procedures of 97.0 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

The frequency of thromboembolism and the importance of anticoagulation were illustrated in a report of 100 patients who were referred to an electrophysiology laboratory for cardioversion of atrial flutter that was present for at least six months: Six patients had a thromboembolic event that was attributable to atrial flutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The event occurred during atrial flutter or after cardioversion and none of the patients were receiving adequate anticoagulation. There were no embolic events in patients on adequate anticoagulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolic-risk-and-the-role-of-anticoagulation-in-atrial-flutter#H529117923\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolic risk and the role of anticoagulation in atrial flutter&quot;, section on 'Long-term flutter'</a>.) One problem with interpreting these data is that many patients with chronic atrial flutter also have periods of atrial fibrillation. &#160;</p><p>Optimal antithrombotic management is unclear in patients with lone atrial flutter who have no identifiable predisposing factor. Patients with lone atrial flutter are at low embolic risk (approximately 0.3 percent per year in younger patients and 0.9 percent per year over the age of 60) and are generally treated with no treatment. Some experts prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for these individuals. </p><p>Our approach to anticoagulation in patients with atrial flutter is identical to that for atrial fibrillation. Though the risk of systemic embolism is probably a little lower compared with atrial fibrillation, it is appropriate to use anticoagulation in atrial flutter as similar to atrial fibrillation and appropriate risk stratification should be completed. Therefore, the choice of appropriate oral anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is based upon embolic risk, in a similar manner as atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-atrial-flutter/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. We advocate the use of the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scoring system.
