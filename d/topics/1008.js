They include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">dabigatran</a> (brand name: Pradaxa), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">rivaroxaban</a> (brand name: Xarelto), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">apixaban</a> (brand name: Eliquis), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edoxaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">edoxaban</a> (brand names: Savaysa, Lixiana), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betrixaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">betrixaban</a> (brand name: Bevyxxa).</p><p>These medicines are also known as &quot;anticoagulants,&quot; &quot;blood thinners,&quot; and &quot;anti-clotting medicines.&quot; They are called &quot;direct acting&quot; because they block clotting directly. &quot;Oral&quot; means they are taken as pills.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H555733471\"><span class=\"h1\">How are these medicines different from warfarin?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Warfarin</a> (sample brand name: Coumadin) has been used for many years to prevent and treat blood clots. The direct oral anticoagulants are newer. They work as well as or better than warfarin for most patients, but have some differences (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F99882\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99882 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People taking the newer medicines do not need regular blood tests to check how their blood is clotting, or changes in the dose. People taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> do need blood tests about once a week to once a month, and they sometimes need to change their dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People taking the newer medicines have very few special rules about their diet (but there are some). People taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> have to watch the amount of leafy greens and other vegetables they eat and try to eat about the same amount every day. These foods contain vitamin K, which affects the warfarin dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several of the newer medicines (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">dabigatran</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">apixaban</a>, and sometimes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">rivaroxaban</a>) might have to be taken two times a day, depending on what they are prescribed for. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edoxaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Edoxaban</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betrixaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">betrixaban</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> are taken just once a day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All of the anti-clotting medicines can cause bleeding. Some kinds of bleeding &ndash; like bleeding in the brain &ndash; are less likely with the newer medicines than with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most of the newer medicines do not have a good a way to quickly stop their effect on how your blood clots. That means if a person starts bleeding while taking one of these medicines, it can be harder for doctors to stop the bleeding. On the other hand, if a person starts bleeding while on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a>, there are often ways to control it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Warfarin</a> pills usually cost less than the newer anti-clotting medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The list of medicines that might change the way <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> works is different from the lists for the newer medicines. But it's still important to talk to your doctor about any medicines you take.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you take a newer anti-clotting medicine, your doctor might have you take a blood test once in a while. This is to check how well your kidneys are working.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with a mechanical heart valve (a device used to replace a damaged heart valve) need to take an anti-clotting medicine. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Warfarin</a> is the medicine used in these patients. People with mechanical heart valves should <strong>not</strong> take the newer anti-clotting medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The newer anti-clotting medicines are not used in pregnant women and in certain other conditions.</p><p/><p>Some of the differences between the anti-clotting medicines are a matter of convenience, and some can be more serious. Ask your doctor which of the medicines is best for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H555733488\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might my doctor prescribe an anti-clotting medicine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main reasons doctors prescribe anti-clotting medicines are to prevent blood clots or to treat blood clots that have already formed. Nothing can completely prevent all blood clots, but these medicines lower the risk of clots.</p><p>These medicines do not dissolve clots, but they keep them from growing bigger and moving to another part of the body.</p><p>Doctors prescribe anti-clotting medicines to prevent clots in:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who have a heart rhythm problem called &quot;atrial fibrillation&quot; &ndash; In people with this condition, the medicine helps lower the chances of stroke from a blood clot.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who have had hip or knee replacement surgery &ndash; These medicines help prevent a blood clot in the legs (called a &quot;deep vein thrombosis&quot; or &quot;DVT&quot;) or the lungs (called a &quot;pulmonary embolism&quot; or &quot;PE&quot;). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betrixaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Betrixaban</a> is only used to prevent blood clots in the legs in certain people who are in the hospital.</p><p/><p>Doctors also prescribe anti-clotting medicines for:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who have had a blood clot in the legs or lungs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who have had a stroke related to atrial fibrillation</p><p/><p>The goal is to lower the chances that the blood clot might get bigger or spread, and to lower the chances of new clots forming.</p><p>If you need an anti-clotting medicine, your doctor might order blood tests to check how well your kidneys or liver work. If you have or develop kidney trouble, the newer anti-clotting medicines might not be right for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H620790813\"><span class=\"h1\">What do I need to do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you take one of the newer medicines to prevent blood clots, there are certain things you should do. These are described below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Know the strength of your clot-preventing medicine, what the pills look like, and why your doctor prescribed it for you</strong> &ndash; The strength of the medicine is given in milligrams (&quot;mg&quot;). Always refill your prescription before you run out of pills.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Take your medicine exactly as your doctor tells you to</strong> &ndash; It is very important to take these medicines exactly as your doctor tells you to. Take them at the same time each day and do not skip any doses. Do not take 2 doses at once, change the dose, or stop taking this drug without talking to your doctor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most anti-clotting medicines can be taken either with or without food. But some should always be taken with food. Make sure you understand whether the pill you have needs to be taken with food.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If you take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">apixaban</a>, avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice. That's because grapefruit can change the effects of apixaban.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Store </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">dabigatran</a><strong> pills in the bottle</strong> <strong>they came in</strong> &ndash; Do not put this medicine in any other container, such as a pill box or pill organizer. If your medicine comes in a bottle, use the pills within 4 months of opening it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Do not break, chew, or open the </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">dabigatran</a><strong> capsules</strong> &ndash; This can change the strength of the medicine. Take dabigatran with a full glass of water after a meal and do not lie down for at least a half hour after taking it. This will lessen the chance of heartburn or an upset stomach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Do not take pain relievers like </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a><strong>, or </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> &ndash; If you need a pain reliever, ask your doctor which one is safe. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) is usually OK.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ask your doctor before taking any new medicines</strong> &ndash; This includes prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines, and herbal medicines. Certain medicines can change the effects of the newer anti-clotting medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Wear a medical alert tag</strong> &ndash; Always wear a bracelet, necklace, or another kind of alert tag that warns people that you take an anti-clotting medicine and why. That way, if you are in an accident and are unable to explain your condition, responders will know how to care for you. Your alert tag should also have the name and phone number of an emergency contact person.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H555733527\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the side effects of the newer medicines to prevent blood clots?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common side effect is bleeding from any part of your body. The bleeding can be minor or sometimes serious. This even includes inside your body, where you cannot see it.</p><p>Call your doctor <strong>right away</strong> if you took more medicine than you were supposed to or if you have any of these possible signs of bleeding:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling sick to your stomach or throwing up blood or something that looks like coffee grounds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headaches, dizziness, or weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nosebleeds or any bleeding that does not stop</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dark red or brown urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood in your bowel movements or dark-colored bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain, swelling, or black and purple skin (bruising) after an injury</p><p/><p>You should also call you doctor if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleed from your gums after brushing your teeth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have heavy menstrual periods or bleeding between periods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have diarrhea, vomit, or are unable to eat for more than 24 hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a fever (temperature higher than 100.4&deg;F or 38&deg;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannot take anti-clotting medicine for any reason</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are in a car accident, hit your head, or have another type of serious injury that could cause bleeding</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H555733545\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do to lower the risk of bleeding?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shave with an electric razor rather than a razor blade</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take care when using sharp objects, such as knives and scissors</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid doing things might make you likely to fall, such as walking on slippery surfaces or climbing on a high stool</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid sports that might cause injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Always use a seatbelt</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid using non-prescription medicines that contain an &quot;NSAID&quot; unless you talk to your doctor first. NSAIDs are a group of pain-relieving medicines that includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a>. Your pharmacist or nurse can tell you if any medicine you are thinking of taking contains an NSAID.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid drinking too much alcohol, which can increase your risk of bleeding</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you see a new doctor, dentist, or nurse, let him or her know you are taking these medicines</p><p/><p>For more detailed information about your medicines, ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist for the patient hand-out from Lexicomp available through UpToDate. The Lexicomp hand-outs explain how to use and store your medicines.
