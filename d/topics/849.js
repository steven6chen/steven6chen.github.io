In marked contrast to differentiated thyroid cancers, anaplastic cancers are extremely aggressive, with a disease-specific mortality approaching 100 percent. Given the very rapid course of disease progression and the poor treatment outcomes, end-of-life issues and plans for comfort care measures are an integral part of initial disease management planning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Early recognition of the disease is essential to allow prompt initiation of therapy.</p><p>The major clinical issues related to anaplastic thyroid cancer will be reviewed here. The molecular pathogenesis of this disorder is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oncogenes-and-tumor-suppressor-genes-in-thyroid-nodules-and-nonmedullary-thyroid-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in thyroid nodules and nonmedullary thyroid cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The age-adjusted annual incidence of anaplastic cancer is approximately one to two per million persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>] and accounts for 0.9 to 9.8 percent of all thyroid cancers globally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Patients with anaplastic cancer are older than those with differentiated cancer; the mean age at diagnosis is 65 years and fewer than 10 percent are younger than 50 years. Sixty to 70 percent of tumors occur in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTECEDENT THYROID DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 20 percent of patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer have a history of differentiated thyroid cancer, and 20 to 30 percent have a coexisting differentiated cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]; the percentage may be even higher with extensive sectioning of the thyroid gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The majority of synchronous thyroid tumors are papillary cancers, but coexisting follicular cancers have also been reported. Nearly 10 percent of patients with H&uuml;rthle cell cancers have foci of anaplastic cancer within the H&uuml;rthle cell cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, transformation from differentiated to anaplastic cancer has been described in a patient who was followed with serial biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>These findings lend support to the hypothesis that anaplastic cancer develops from more differentiated tumors as a result of one or more dedifferentiating events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Since activating mutations in <em>BRAF</em> and RAS are seen in both well-differentiated thyroid malignancies and anaplastic thyroid cancer, these are presumed to be early events in the progression pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Late events that are seen more commonly in the anaplastic tumor rather than the precursor well-differentiated tumor include mutations in p53 tumor suppressor protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>], 16p [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], catenin (cadherin-associated protein), beta 1, and <em>PIK3CA </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Up to one-half of patients have a history of multinodular goiter, and some have a history of partial thyroidectomy for goiter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2187194\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly all patients with anaplastic cancer present with a thyroid mass. However, regional or distant spread is apparent at the time of initial diagnosis in 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/12-14,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14,25</a>]. Sites of regional involvement can include the perithyroidal fat and muscle, lymph nodes, larynx, trachea, esophagus, tonsil, and great vessels of the neck and mediastinum. Distant metastases are found at initial disease presentation in 15 to 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/9-11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11,13</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lungs are the most common site of distant metastases, being involved in up to 90 percent of patients with distant disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. These metastases are usually intrapulmonary mass lesions, but pleural involvement can occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 5 to 15 percent of patients have bone metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Five percent have brain metastases, and a few have metastases to the skin, liver, kidneys, pancreas, heart, and adrenal glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/10-12,26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12,26-30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rare patients have no detectable thyroid tumor at the time of diagnosis, presenting with metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary symptom of anaplastic cancer is a rapidly enlarging neck mass, occurring in approximately 85 percent of patients. The enlarging thyroid tumor may cause neck pain and tenderness, and compression (or invasion) of the upper aerodigestive tract, resulting in dyspnea (approximately 35 percent of patients), dysphagia (30 percent), hoarseness (25 percent), cough (and sometimes hemoptysis, 25 percent). Less common symptoms are chest pain, bone pain, headache, confusion, or abdominal pain from metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/26,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,31</a>].</p><p>Constitutional symptoms can occur, including anorexia, weight loss, fatigue, and fever of unknown origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. Rarely, rapid growth of the tumor within the thyroid causes thyroiditis, with symptoms of hyperthyroidism and more severe neck pain and tenderness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/26,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,35,36</a>].</p><p>On physical examination, most patients have bilateral but asymmetric thyroid enlargement. The goiter is typically hard and nodular and may be tender. A dominant nodule is often present. Some nodules may be softer and fluctuant, indicating focal tumor necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A few patients have a solitary nodule or a diffuse non-nodular goiter. The goiter is often fixed to the surrounding structures and does not move with swallowing. By the time of presentation, the primary tumor is usually greater than 5 cm in diameter, but exact measurements are often difficult because the borders of the tumor are indistinct.</p><p>Approximately 50 percent of patients have enlarged cervical lymph nodes. Other findings of local extension of the disease include stridor, tracheal deviation, vocal cord paralysis due to compression or invasion of the trachea, and venous dilatation and superior vena cava syndrome due to retrosternal tumor growth.</p><p>The skin overlying the tumor may be erythematous or even ulcerated, and there may be metastases in the skin of the chest and abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/14,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,37</a>]. Focal neurologic symptoms or signs suggesting brain metastases may also be present.</p><p>Most patients have normal serum thyroid hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations, except for those few patients with tumor-related thyroiditis and hyperthyroidism from presumed rapid tumor growth and concomitant tissue destruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/26,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,35,36</a>]. Serum thyroglobulin concentrations may be high, most often due to secretion from a coexisting differentiated cancer, rather than the anaplastic cancer. Rare patients have leukocytosis due to tumor secretion of lymphokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p>The findings on thyroid ultrasound are not specific for anaplastic thyroid cancer. Ultrasonography cannot distinguish benign from malignant intrathyroidal tumors (both tend to be hypoechoic). However, detection of extrathyroidal invasion can provide support for the diagnosis of cancer. Ultrasonography of the neck also can accurately identify involvement of local and regional nodes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical utility of ultrasonography in thyroid disease&quot;, section on 'Criteria for identifying cancer'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of anaplastic cancer is usually established by cytologic examination of cells obtained by fine needle aspiration biopsy or of tissue obtained by large needle or surgical biopsy. Ultrasonography can be used to guide fine needle aspiration of solid, non-necrotic tumor. In a series of 113 fine needle aspirates in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer, 107 (94.7 percent) were diagnostic of malignancy, and 96 of 107 were diagnosed as anaplastic thyroid cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The remaining 11 were diagnosed as differentiated thyroid cancer and malignant tumor not otherwise specified. Large needle (core) or surgical biopsy is typically performed when the fine needle aspiration shows necrotic or inflamed tissue without a specific diagnosis. Evaluation of the biopsy material should include routine light microscopy and analysis with immunohistochemistry. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-guided-thyroid-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound-guided thyroid biopsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>On cytopathology, morphologic patterns of anaplastic thyroid cancer include spindle cell, pleomorphic giant cell, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> squamoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Many anaplastic thyroid cancers have a mixed morphology of two or all three patterns. One common mixed morphologic type is biphasic spindle and giant cell tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F88833\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88833 \">picture 1</a>). Numerous mitotic figures and atypical mitoses are present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F88832\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef88832 \">picture 2</a>). There is typically extensive necrosis. Unlike differentiated thyroid cancer, anaplastic thyroid cancer cells are much less likely to stain positive for thyroid transcription factor-1 <em>(TTF1</em>) or PAX-8 and do not stain positive for thyroglobulin in the anaplastic component of the tumor (may see thyroglobulin staining in the associated more well differentiated component of the tumor) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F88072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88072 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29674060\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other malignancies that may look histologically similar to anaplastic thyroid cancer but have significantly different treatment and prognosis include poorly differentiated thyroid cancer, medullary thyroid cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, and sarcoma. Differentiation of anaplastic and poorly differentiated thyroid cancer may be difficult in some patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer who have coexisting poorly differentiated (or well-differentiated) thyroid cancer. Careful attention to morphology and immunohistochemical studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F88072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88072 \">table 1</a>) is required to distinguish anaplastic thyroid cancer from poorly differentiated thyroid cancer and other malignancies.</p><p>The differential diagnosis in a patient presenting with a neck mass is extensive and varies with the age of the patient at presentation. Although the majority of these masses represent benign thyroid nodules and cysts or differentiated thyroid cancer, a rapidly growing neck mass is concerning for anaplastic thyroid cancer (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules&quot;</a>). Neck masses that are not of thyroidal origin may be congenital (ie, vascular anomaly), inflammatory (lymph node enlargement), or other neoplastic (primary or metastatic disease) disorders. The differential diagnosis of a neck mass is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-a-neck-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of a neck mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2187238\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients diagnosed with anaplastic thyroid cancer on the basis of the findings on cytopathology, evaluation should include laboratory evaluation and imaging studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6357864\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We typically measure thyroid function tests (TSH, free thyroxine [T4]), if not previously measured, complete blood count, electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose, and liver function tests. We also measure serum calcium and phosphorus to assess for hypercalcemia of malignancy or hypocalcemia due to compromise of the parathyroid glands secondary to invading anaplastic thyroid cancer. Since anaplastic thyroid cancer often arises in a setting of a more well-differentiated thyroid cancer, we measure serum thyroglobulin as part of the initial evaluation to assess for the possibility of metastatic well-differentiated thyroid cancer and to assist in determining if the metastatic lesions are from the well-differentiated component of the tumor (rather than anaplastic metastatic sites), recognizing that elevated serum thyroglobulin can also be seen in nodular thyroid disease and goiter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appropriate imaging is critical for defining the extent of disease, planning therapy, and monitoring the response to treatment. Consistent with the recommendations from the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines for the management of patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer, we typically obtain ultrasound of the neck (if not already performed), positron emission tomography (PET) using 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG; neck to pelvis), and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (or computed tomography [CT]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. If PET scanning is not readily available, cross-sectional imaging of the brain, neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis with CT or MRI provides adequate initial staging information.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PET scan is being used with increasing frequency to evaluate and monitor patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer. In patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer, there is intense uptake of 18FDG in the primary thyroid tumor, cervical, and mediastinal lymph nodes, and in distant metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT of the neck and mediastinum can accurately delineate the extent of the thyroid tumor and identify tumor invasion of the great vessels and upper aerodigestive tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Typical findings include masses that are isodense or slightly hyperdense relative to skeletal muscle, dense calcifications, and areas of necrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F79632\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79632 \">image 1</a>). MRI is similarly useful for defining the local extent of disease and for identifying distant metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with bony metastases, skeletal radiographs typically show lytic lesions.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3574001\"><span class=\"h2\">Metastatic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because 20 to 30 percent of patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer have coexisting differentiated thyroid cancer, the presence of metastases does not automatically indicate that they originate from anaplastic thyroid cancer. The serum thyroglobulin level <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PET scan may help distinguish between the two. In patients with metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer, the thyroglobulin level is markedly elevated, whereas it should be normal in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer. In addition, compared with metastases from differentiated thyroid cancer, metastases from anaplastic thyroid cancer are hypermetabolic and have more avid uptake on PET scanning. Rarely, fine needle biopsy of distant metastatic sites is required to differentiate anaplastic from differentiated thyroid cancer. In patients with surgically resectable disease, biopsy of distant metastases can be performed after completion of primary surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6358271\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer who present with a rapidly growing neck mass and voice hoarseness require evaluation by an <span class=\"nowrap\">otolaryngologist/head</span> and neck surgeon to assess for vocal cord function, airway invasion, and resectability.</p><p>If available, next-generation molecular sequencing of the cancer should be performed to evaluate for the presence of targetable mutations that might be able to be treated either on a clinical trial (preferred) or through a compassionate use program. Promising targets that are seen in anaplastic thyroid cancer and should be included in the evaluation include <em>BRAF</em>, <em>TSC1</em>, <em>TSC2</em>, <em>ALK</em> fusion genes and <em>NTRK</em> fusion genes. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3574110\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) have adopted the eighth (2017) TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification system, which is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2018 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110635\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110635 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In the updated staging system, the T category follows the same definitions as those used for differentiated thyroid cancers, rather than classifying all anaplastic thyroid cancer as T4 disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differentiated-thyroid-cancer-clinicopathologic-staging#H3671358\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differentiated thyroid cancer: Clinicopathologic staging&quot;, section on 'TNM system'</a>.)</p><p>All anaplastic cancers are considered stage IV cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Intrathyroidal anaplastic cancers are designated IVA, whereas anaplastic cancers with gross extrathyroidal extension or cervical lymph node metastases are IVB and with distant metastases IVC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15939925\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few randomized trials assessing treatment strategies for anaplastic thyroid cancer. The following approach, which is largely consistent with the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for management of patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/41,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,51</a>], is based upon case series and clinical experience. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Tumor localized to the thyroid or locally advanced operable disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who present with resectable tumors, we suggest complete resection followed by combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

Surgical resection for residual tumor could be considered if the disease is responsive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15939720\"><span class=\"h3\">Metastatic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no effective therapy for metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer, and the disease is uniformly fatal.

In patients with advanced disease, palliation of symptoms is a high priority [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Locoregional resection may be necessary for palliation of airway or esophageal obstruction. However, death is usually attributable to upper airway obstruction and suffocation (often despite tracheostomy) in 50 to 60 percent of patients and to a combination of complications of local and distant disease in the remainder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/12,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,55</a>].

However, if the tumor appears localized to the thyroid or if locoregional disease is resectable, complete resection should be attempted as long as gross tumor resection can be achieved with minimal morbidity. After complete resection, some patients have prolonged survival (&gt;2 years), often in conjunction with postoperative adjuvant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/7,12,52,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12,52,57</a>].

As long as the tumor is small and confined entirely to the thyroid, total thyroidectomy with complete tumor resection does not prolong survival compared with ipsilateral thyroid lobectomy and is associated with a higher complication rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. Nevertheless, some experts prefer total or near total thyroidectomy with central and lateral neck lymph node dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The rationale for this is that differentiated thyroid cancer and anaplastic thyroid cancer often coexist, and total thyroidectomy offers a greater chance of complete resection. For patients with a small intrathyroidal anaplastic cancer associated with a differentiated thyroid cancer, we favor total thyroidectomy, if it can be done with complete gross resection of tumor and minimal morbidity, to facilitate subsequent treatment of the differentiated cancer.</p><p>For patients with locally advanced disease, the extent of surgery depends upon the degree of soft tissue involvement. Options include total thyroidectomy, lobectomy with wide margins of adjacent soft tissue, or en bloc resection. If complete en bloc resection (sparing the larynx) can be achieved with minimal morbidity, it should be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) may be administered in the adjuvant setting, after surgical resection, or as primary treatment in patients who have inoperable disease.</p><p>Analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database found that surgery and EBRT improved survival for patients with disease extending into adjacent tissues who did not have distant metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]; the efficacy of adjuvant radiotherapy after surgery is supported by other uncontrolled observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/7,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,59,60</a>]. When administered in conventional doses alone, EBRT does <strong>not</strong> prolong survival when administered for advanced disease. Although up to 80 percent of patients may initially respond to radiation, most have local recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>The most appropriate radiation volumes remain uncertain and require further investigation. Hyperfractionation administers multiple daily treatments with smaller than conventional fraction sizes given over approximately the same treatment duration. This strategy, which enables high &quot;radical&quot; doses (&gt;40 Gy) to be delivered over a short time with acceptable toxicity, appears to be associated with improved local control of disease in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer. In a retrospective study of 47 patients who underwent hyperfractionated (radical, median dose 60 Gy in a once- or twice-daily fractionation schedule) or palliative (median dose 20 Gy in five fractions over one week) radiotherapy, the median overall survival (11.1 versus 3.2 months) and six-month, progression-free rate (94.1 versus 64.6 percent) were significantly higher with radical compared with palliative radiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. There was also a trend towards improved survival with twice-daily compared with once-daily fractionation.</p><p>For patients with locally advanced disease, hyperfractionated radiotherapy combined with radiosensitizing doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> may increase the local response rate to approximately 80 percent, with subsequent median survival of one year; distant metastases then become the leading cause of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. However, further analysis of this regimen suggests the data may not be as good as originally thought [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>Several centers have changed from using hyperfractionated radiation therapy to intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. A current randomized phase II study being done through the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG 0912) for anaplastic thyroid cancer is also using IMRT with a total dose of 66 Gy in 33 daily fractions. All of these studies include concurrent chemotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a taxane as the standard regimen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemotherapy</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cytotoxic</strong> &ndash; In a phase II study of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">cisplatin/doxorubicin</span> in patients with advanced thyroid cancer, 39 subjects with anaplastic thyroid cancer were included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

We typically obtain computed tomography (CT) scan (neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis) every one to three months for the first 24 months and then less frequently (every four to six months) thereafter. Brain imaging during the first three months after treatment is recommended. In patients with no clinical evidence of disease on CT scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan may show disease recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anaplastic-thyroid-cancer/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Thus, we also obtain PET imaging three to six months after initial therapy (in patients with no disease on CT). Other imaging studies should be based upon clinical symptoms that develop during follow-up.</p><p>Patients who have total thyroidectomy require thyroid hormone therapy to replace normal thyroid hormone production. T4 (approximately 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> of body weight) should be started immediately after surgery. The adequacy of therapy should be evaluated clinically and by measurement of serum TSH in one month. The goal of T4 therapy should be to restore and maintain euthyroidism; suppression of serum TSH concentrations to less than normal is not indicated, unless for treatment of coexisting differentiated thyroid cancer.

Several important prognostic characteristics have been identified.

Initial imaging to determine extent of disease should include ultrasound of the neck (if not already performed), positron emission tomography (PET) using 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (neck to pelvis), and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (or computed tomography [CT]). If PET scanning is not readily available, cross-sectional imaging of the brain, neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis with CT or MRI provides adequate initial staging information.
