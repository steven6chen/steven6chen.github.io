The pathogenesis is incompletely understood, but acquired mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes appear to be involved. Gene sequencing reveals recurrent mutations in MLL2, PTTPRD, NOTCH2, and KLF2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>While some studies have suggested an association between NMZL and infectious and autoimmune disorders, this association is not as well established as it is for extranodal marginal zone lymphoma and splenic marginal zone lymphoma. Epidemiologic studies have identified an association between hepatitis C virus infection and NMZL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4066420747\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NMZL is the least common of the marginal zone lymphomas and accounts for approximately 1 percent of non-Hodgkin lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The incidence is approximately six cases per million person-years overall and increases from &lt;1 per million for persons &lt;40 years of age to &gt;10 per million for persons &gt;60 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Median age at diagnosis is approximately 70 years. There is a slight male predominance in most series. The incidence is highest among non-Hispanic Whites and lowest among Blacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Pediatric NMZL is a distinct entity with an excellent prognosis that typically presents with asymptomatic localized disease involving the lymph nodes of the head and neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2158643509\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of NMZL is nonspecific and highly variable. Most patients with NMZL present with painless peripheral adenopathy in the cervical, axillary, inguinal, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> femoral regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Staging studies often demonstrate widely disseminated (stage III or IV) nodal involvement. Up to one-third have tumors &gt;5 cm (ie, bulky disease). Bone marrow is involved in 30 to 60 percent; rarely, circulating tumor cells are seen in the peripheral blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. The spleen and other extranodal tissues are not usually involved at presentation; however, spread to these sites may be seen in individuals with widespread nodal disease. </p><p>Despite widespread involvement, most patients with NMZL are asymptomatic at diagnosis.

The diagnosis is best made by excisional lymph node biopsy with further evaluation to exclude extranodal marginal zone lymphoma, splenic marginal zone lymphoma, and other entities that resemble NMZL. A directed evaluation of extranodal sites based upon lymph node involvement should be performed to exclude primary extranodal disease. This is described in more detail as part of the pretreatment evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H73869423\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>NMZL is a primary nodal lymphoma and the clinical presentation is a key part of the diagnosis and distinguishing it from extranodal marginal zone lymphoma and splenic marginal zone lymphoma. The spleen and other extranodal tissues are not usually involved in NMZL at presentation; however, spread to these sites may be seen in individuals with widespread nodal disease. At times it may be unclear exactly where the disease originated. A diagnosis of NMZL is favored if there is widespread nodal involvement, even in the setting of splenic enlargement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> minimal extranodal involvement. In contrast, extranodal marginal zone lymphoma is favored when the extranodal involvement is prominent and nodal involvement is localized.</p><p>It is not known whether marginal zone lymphoma of Waldeyer's ring should be classified as NMZL or extranodal marginal zone lymphoma. The diagnoses of splenic marginal zone lymphoma and extranodal marginal zone lymphoma are presented separately.

Most cases of &quot;composite&quot; lymphomas with other histologically low grade lymphomas (eg, chiefly follicular lymphoma) represent focal differentiation of a single lymphoma clone to marginal zone or monocytoid B cells, and not true composite lymphomas; these cases should be diagnosed as a single lymphoma (usually follicular lymphoma), and not as NMZL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Other B cell neoplasms that may be confused with NMZL include those that are also composed mainly of small B cells:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Follicular lymphoma (FL)</strong> &ndash; NMZL can demonstrate a partially nodular pattern of growth that may resemble FL. NMZL can usually be differentiated from FL by immunophenotype since, unlike FL, marginal zone lymphoma does not usually express CD10, BCL2, or BCL6.

In general, we perform the following examinations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination with determination of the patient's performance status by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) or Karnofsky performance scales (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory testing includes a complete blood count with differential and platelet count, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes, lactate dehydrogenase, HIV, and hepatitis C virus serology. Patients should also be tested for hepatitis B virus prior to the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> therapy. Women of childbearing age should undergo a pregnancy test if chemotherapy or radiation therapy is planned.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging should include a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. The decision to include positron emission tomography (PET) is individualized. Studies evaluating the use of PET in marginal zone lymphoma have demonstrated variable FDG avidity, although the sensitivity for detecting nodal involvement is high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma/abstract/11,12,17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,17-21</a>].

While remissions can be attained, repeated relapses are common. Treatment focuses on the alleviation of symptoms, reversal of cytopenias, and improvement of quality of life. As such, asymptomatic patients often do not require immediate treatment but should be followed for the development of symptoms and progression of disease. This approach is similar to that used for other clinically indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas such as follicular lymphoma.

Most data come from retrospective studies and extrapolation of data from other common indolent lymphomas, such as follicular lymphoma. While patients with marginal zone lymphoma tend to respond to therapies used for other indolent lymphomas, some studies that have provided data for this subpopulation have noted differences in response rates and other clinically important outcomes, as described below. Until more data are available from trials limited to patients with marginal zone lymphoma, patients with marginal zone lymphoma not on a clinical trial are often treated in a similar fashion to those with the more common indolent lymphoma follicular lymphoma.
