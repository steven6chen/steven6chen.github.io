External diameters and lengths vary depending upon the manufacturer. The distal end of the rigid bronchoscope is usually beveled to facilitate intubation and lifting of the epiglottis; the proximal portion is equipped to accommodate attachments, provide side port ventilation, and permit insertion of ancillary instruments.</p><p>Intubation with the rigid bronchoscope usually prompts the following questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What anesthesia and patient preparation techniques are commonly used?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How is direct intubation performed?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is laryngoscopically-guided intubation possible?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can intubation be performed through a tracheostomy?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What complications arise from faulty technique?</p><p/><p>Issues relating to the general procedures surrounding the intubation techniques of rigid bronchoscopy will be reviewed here. The history of rigid bronchoscopy (including current instrumentation) and an overview of bronchoscopy (including indications and contraindications) are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rigid-bronchoscopy-instrumentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rigid bronchoscopy: Instrumentation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Indications and contraindications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following general preparative procedures should be performed prior to intubation using a rigid bronchoscope (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Indications and contraindications&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical anesthesia is applied using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracaine</a>. Additional topical anesthetic is usually administered to the tracheobronchial tree after intubation with the rigid bronchoscope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients are oxygenated by mask, and pharyngeal secretions are aspirated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dentures are removed, and the teeth and gums are carefully inspected. The teeth may be protected with gauze pads, foam rubber, or plastic mouth guards.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some operators place a rolled blanket or towel between the shoulder blades in order to thrust the upper trachea forward and extend the cervical spine. Others suspend the head and neck over the edge of the operating table and support them with the bronchoscopist's knee.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depending upon the position of the glottis and the laryngotracheobronchial axis, it may be necessary to use one, two, or no pillows beneath the patient's head when it is resting on the table. Careful attention should be paid to patients with cervical spine disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANESTHESIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anesthesiologists have become increasingly comfortable with intravenous general anesthesia, which avoids the administration of potentially noxious gases. Muscle relaxation and paralysis can be avoided with the use of assisted spontaneous ventilation, and wake-up time may be shortened. The combination of intravenous general anesthesia with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a> and assisted spontaneous ventilation is currently the most frequently used anesthesia technique for rigid bronchoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rigid-bronchoscopy-intubation-techniques/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>Complete muscle relaxation is occasionally desirable, particularly if rigid bronchoscopy is stimulating and if work is being performed within the lower airways. When general anesthesia with inhaled gases is employed, it is essential to pack the nose and mouth to avoid gas leakage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68727\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68727 \">picture 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rigid-bronchoscopy-intubation-techniques/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Packing, however, may impede manipulation of the rigid bronchoscope within the tracheobronchial tree. When packing is performed, Vaseline gauze is used in the nasal passages, and rolled gauze is placed in the mouth, firmly securing the rigid bronchoscope.</p><p>Ventilatory support can be provided using assisted spontaneous ventilation or closed-circuit positive pressure ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rigid-bronchoscopy-intubation-techniques/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. High frequency ventilation is favored by some experts, but availability of this modality may be limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rigid-bronchoscopy-intubation-techniques/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'High frequency ventilation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIRECT INTUBATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct intubation using a rigid telescope is the method of choice for rigid bronchoscopic intubation. With this technique, the rigid telescope is placed inside the bronchoscope, and the laryngeal structures are viewed directly through the telescope. Illumination is provided through the distal aspect of the rigid telescope, which is attached via a light cable to a cold light source. By comparison, if a rigid telescope is not used, the bronchoscope is introduced using only the naked eye. The following is a brief summary of the sequential steps required for direct intubation using a rigid telescope:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bronchoscopist stands directly behind the head of the supine patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rigid bronchoscope is held in the right hand with its tip uppermost. The middle finger of the left hand is used to protect the upper teeth and gums and to control head movements. The telescope should not extend beyond the edge of the rigid bronchoscope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bronchoscope is inserted with its tip facing forward. Looking through the telescope, the bronchoscopist identifies the uvula posteriorly, and the bronchoscope is advanced along the route of the tongue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rigid bronchoscope is gently lifted upwards and the epiglottis is brought into view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71905\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef71905 \">movie 1</a>). The anterior aspect of the beveled tip of the bronchoscope is then slid under the epiglottis. Gentle advancement of the rigid tube provides further access to the larynx.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After both arytenoids are identified, the rigid tube is lifted more anteriorly and the vocal cords are seen. As the vocal cords are approached, the tip of the bronchoscope is rotated 90 degrees laterally so that the beveled tip lies between them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bronchoscope is advanced and rotated to enter the trachea without traumatizing the larynx.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once beyond the level of the cricoid cartilage, the bronchoscope may be rotated so that the beveled tip lies along the posterior wall of the trachea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51963\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef51963 \">movie 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">INTUBATION WITH LARYNGOSCOPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For operators who are uncomfortable with direct intubation but who are adept at laryngoscopy, the vocal cords may be visualized using the rigid laryngoscope alone. Either straight or curved instruments may be used with intubation during rigid laryngoscopy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the laryngoscope in the midline and after the epiglottis has been lifted, the rigid bronchoscope is inserted into the lateral aspect of the mouth and directed toward the larynx. Care must be taken to avoid obstruction of the larynx by the rigid tube.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As the bronchoscope is inserted between the vocal cords, it is rotated slightly and kept in the midline to avoid striking the beveled edge of the bronchoscope against the lateral wall of the subglottis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the bronchoscope is inserted through the cords, the laryngoscope is removed, and the rigid telescope can be placed into the rigid bronchoscope. The bronchoscope is then advanced further into the tracheal lumen.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INTUBATION VIA TRACHEOSTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intubation through a tracheostomy is a relatively simple technique. After topical anesthesia with viscous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> applied to the edges of the tracheostomy, the rigid bronchoscope can be inserted directly through the stoma from a lateral position.</p><p>Tracheostomy intubation is easiest if the bronchoscopist stands behind the patient and slightly to the patient's left or right. Care is taken to insert a long, rigid tube obliquely in order to avoid striking the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope against the posterior wall of the trachea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Expertise in rigid bronchoscopy requires a long apprenticeship. In addition, bronchoscopists must never forget that they share the airway with the anesthesiologist. Oxygenation and ventilation must always take priority over any manipulations of the rigid bronchoscope.</p><p>Most complications of rigid bronchoscopy are related to poor insertion technique, prolonged trauma of the larynx and vocal cords, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, or hemodynamic instability. Specific complications include damage to structures of the mouth and oropharynx, laryngeal swelling, spinal cord injury, and airway perforation and injury to the vocal cords and arytenoids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Damage to structures of the mouth and oropharynx</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Careful inspection of the mouth and teeth is essential to avoid dislodging a loose tooth. In addition, the gums should not be traumatized, and the lips should not be injured by accidentally pulling them into the mouth above or below the rigid bronchoscope. Precautions should also be taken in patients who may have herpes infections of the oropharyngeal airway.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Laryngeal swelling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laryngeal swelling may occur during or immediately following rigid bronchoscopy. It is unclear, however, whether either inhalation of beta agonists prior to procedure or the administration of intravenous corticosteroids before and after rigid bronchoscopy may be beneficial in preventing this problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal cord injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal cord injuries are possible in patients with cervical spine disease and severe osteoporosis. In selected cases, the presence of either of these diseases is a contraindication to rigid bronchoscopic intubation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway perforation and injury to the vocal cords and arytenoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two major complications that must be avoided are airway wall perforation (particularly of the posterior wall of the trachea and the subglottic region) and luxation or laceration at the level of the vocal cords and arytenoids. Such injuries may occur because of faulty intubation technique or if intubation is attempted before a patient is fully asleep or sufficiently anesthetized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rigid bronchoscope is a potentially dangerous instrument. It consists of a hollow stainless steel tube that provides access to the central airways and through which a rigid telescope is placed. External diameters and lengths vary depending upon the manufacturer.
