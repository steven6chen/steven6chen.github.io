The prevalence of urinary incontinence in men ranges from 11 to 34 percent in men older than 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>Urinary incontinence rates increase with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Using a definition of at least one urinary incontinence episode in the preceding 12 months among community-dwelling men, the prevalence increases from 4.8 percent in men age 19 to 44 years, to 11.2 percent age 45 to 64 years, to 21.1 percent older than 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The prevalence of daily urinary incontinence is 2 to 11 percent in men older than 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Prevalence of incontinence does not appear to vary by race or ethnicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of urinary incontinence in men is significantly higher for individuals living in nursing homes (45 to 72 percent) compared with community settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Men with urinary incontinence have a higher risk of institutionalization compared with men without urinary incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Estimates of specific types of urinary incontinence in men are difficult to ascertain due to the natural history of incontinence being affected by treatment for prostate disease. The distribution of urgency incontinence varies between genders, with urge urinary incontinence constituting a much larger portion of total urinary incontinence in men than in women. Mixed incontinence is relatively rare in men, although it is the most common type in women. Men with urgency incontinence have a higher rate of depression and are more likely to alter activities (eg, decrease work hours, change employment, or take early voluntary retirement) compared with men who do not have urgency incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Some evidence suggests that the presence of urinary incontinence in men may have a greater emotional and social impact on quality of life compared with women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. Despite the important burden of urinary incontinence in men, only one in five men with symptoms are likely to seek care; men are half as likely as women to seek care for urinary incontinence (22 versus 45 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H711967525\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for urgency incontinence in men include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advanced age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prostate disease, particularly with a history of prostate surgery or radiation therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of urinary tract infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical limitations, including impairments in activities of daily living</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic disease, particularly stroke, spinal cord injury, and impaired cognition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constipation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep apnea</p><p/><p>Risk factors for stress incontinence in men include previous prostate surgery, pelvic trauma, and neurologic disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9860217\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of urinary incontinence depends on the specific type of incontinence. Urinary incontinence is usually due to disease of the lower urinary tract. However, urinary incontinence can also be due to other causes, including medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F101070\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101070 \">table 1</a>) or not being able to reach the bathroom in time to urinate as a result of comorbid illness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence#H21989288\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of women with urinary incontinence&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>There are four major types of urinary incontinence associated with lower urinary tract dysfunction: urgency incontinence, stress incontinence, mixed incontinence, and incontinence due to incomplete bladder emptying.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9860226\"><span class=\"h2\">Urgency incontinence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanisms responsible for urgency incontinence are poorly understood, both in men and women. The etiology of urgency incontinence is partly related to uninhibited bladder contractions (also called detrusor overactivity). This may be due to a defect in afferent sensory signaling from the urinary tract, central processing of these signals, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> detrusor muscle dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62790\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62790 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9860233\"><span class=\"h2\">Stress incontinence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stress urinary incontinence in men is most commonly due to poor urethral sphincter function. Prostate surgery is the most common cause of stress urinary incontinence in men. It can also occur in those who have had pelvic trauma or a neurologic disorder (eg, traumatic spinal cord injury, spina bifida).</p><p>The two most frequently performed prostate surgeries leading to stress incontinence are transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and radical prostatectomy. TURP involves the resection of obstructing prostate tissue using a cystoscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58306\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58306 \">figure 2</a>). Damage to the external urethral sphincter can occur during TURP, but this is uncommon; in contemporary series, reported rates of urinary incontinence following TURP are &lt;1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transurethral-procedures-for-treating-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transurethral procedures for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Radical prostatectomy is performed to treat prostate cancer. As the external urethral sphincter is closely approximated to the prostatic apex, this structure can be damaged during the surgical dissection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54803\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54803 \">figure 3</a>). Following radical prostatectomy, it is common for men to initially experience stress incontinence. However, this typically improves or resolves over a course of 12 to 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. Up to 40 percent of men report some degree of long-term urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy, but the majority of cases are mild and do not require treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The rate of persistent, bothersome urinary incontinence following radical prostatectomy is approximately 5 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radical-prostatectomy-for-localized-prostate-cancer#H24077719\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Retropubic prostatectomy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H711968463\"><span class=\"h2\">Incomplete emptying (overflow incontinence)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incomplete emptying is a less common cause of incontinence that is due to impaired detrusor contractility <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bladder outlet obstruction. A common presentation is nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting) due to pelvic floor relaxation that occurs at night, combined with a very full bladder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H711968224\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no specific evidence-based guidelines for screening in men.</p><p>It is our practice to screen men who have risk factors for urinary incontinence. (See <a href=\"#H711967525\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>Urinary incontinence screening has been incorporated into health care quality process measures in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The following screening questions may identify men with urinary incontinence:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you ever leak <span class=\"nowrap\">urine/water</span> when you don't want to?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you ever leak urine when you cough, laugh, or exercise?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you ever leak urine on the way to the bathroom?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9860240\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history, physical examination, and urinalysis are sufficient to guide initial evaluation of urinary incontinence in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The initial evaluation is also helpful in identifying the type of urinary continence (urge, stress, mixed, incomplete emptying), which will direct treatment options.</p><p>This initial evaluation should also identify men with &quot;complicated urinary incontinence&quot; who may need referral to a urologist. (See <a href=\"#H148744922\" class=\"local\">'Referral'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H711968508\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key components of the history include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset and temporal course of incontinence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Precipitants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bowel function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of prostate disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbidities</p><p/><p>Key components of the history are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence#H21990400\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of women with urinary incontinence&quot;, section on 'History'</a>.)</p><p>Known potentially reversible causes of urinary incontinence should be reviewed with the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence#H21990073\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of women with urinary incontinence&quot;, section on 'Other contributing factors/conditions'</a>.)</p><p>A history of previous treatment for prostate disease is also important, as this is a major risk factor for both urge and stress incontinence. If prostate cancer has been previously diagnosed, it is important to be aware of the current tumor status, as this may affect treatment options. As an example, a man with locally advanced prostate cancer would not be a good candidate for artificial sphincter placement. (See <a href=\"#H9860291\" class=\"local\">'Surgical treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H711968501\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key components of the physical examination are similar for men and women, with a particular focus on the cardiovascular, abdominal, and neurologic examinations. Notable differences in the male examination are listed below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-women-with-urinary-incontinence#H21990869\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of women with urinary incontinence&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>Uncircumcised men should be checked for phimosis and balanitis. The position of the urethral meatus should be noted, as a very proximal position (hypospadias) may cause postvoid dribbling and other bothersome symptoms. After retraction, the foreskin should be replaced in position to avoid causing paraphimosis. Paraphimosis refers to a retracted foreskin in an uncircumcised or partially circumcised male that cannot be returned to normal position. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=balanitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Balanitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraphimosis-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraphimosis: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The scrotal skin should be examined for infections or sebaceous cysts. The scrotal contents should be gently palpated to evaluate for masses. The inguinal region should be assessed for the presence of a hernia, since straining in men with partial urinary obstruction can worsen an inguinal hernia. The digital rectal examination is best performed with the patient standing and bent over the examination table, or with the patient in the knee-chest position. Anal sphincter tone and the presence of rectal masses or fecal impaction should be noted. Prostate size and consistency should also be assessed. The presence of a prostate nodule is an indication for urology referral. The estimation of prostate size by digital examination provides a gross estimate of the degree of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) but is less reliable than direct volume measurements with ultrasound.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H414558001\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A urinalysis should be performed in all patients, with urine culture if infection is suspected. Urine cytology is indicated only if there is hematuria or risk factors for bladder cancer (eg, extensive smoking history, previous bladder tumor). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of bladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Measurement of renal function should be obtained if recent results are unavailable.</p><p>Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing should be considered in men who present with urinary incontinence. PSA levels may be affected by treatments for prostate disease (eg, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, prostate surgery). The benefits and risks of PSA testing should be discussed with the patient. Indications for PSA testing in men with lower urinary tract symptoms should be the same as in asymptomatic men, although others would suggest a lower threshold for testing in men with urinary symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-prostate-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-urinary-tract-symptoms-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower urinary tract symptoms in men&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia#H2115708238\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;, section on 'Prostate-specific antigen'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H549550\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional studies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H711969076\"><span class=\"h3\">Postvoid residual</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Poor bladder emptying may be suspected based on history and examination findings. This can be documented by measuring postvoid residual (PVR) using ultrasound or catheterization. American Urological Association guidelines on BPH recommend against routine PVR testing for men with mild to moderate lower urinary symptoms related to prostatic hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation-of-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia#H3963132865\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation of benign prostatic hyperplasia&quot;, section on 'Post-void residual urine volume'</a>).

It is important to treat a bladder neck contracture prior to performing surgery for male stress incontinence, as treatment of the bladder neck contracture is much more complicated after these surgeries.

Treatment aimed at simply decreasing the number of incontinent episodes (the focus of the majority of treatment trials) may not be sufficient to improve the quality of life for patients most bothered by the timing or inconvenience of urinary incontinence, or nocturia.</p><p>Stepwise treatment strategies should be discussed with the patient. In general, treatment should advance from least invasive to more invasive therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In older patients, correcting contributory factors such as comorbid conditions, functional impairment, and medications should be the initial focus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>For men with urge, stress, or mixed incontinence, initial treatment follows the same principles as in women and should include lifestyle advice, behavioral therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medications.

Successful use of an external catheter requires adherence of the condom sheath to the penis. Use of external catheters may not be possible in some patients who are not able to keep catheters in place (eg, due to skin infections) or are not physically able to place catheters (eg, obesity, neurologic impairment). In patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction, the use of an external catheter may be associated with progressive renal damage unless it is confirmed with urodynamics that bladder storage pressures remain low.

In men, multiple injections (up to four) are usually required to achieve satisfactory results, which generally last one year or less, at which point an additional injection is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9860321\"><span class=\"h4\">Perineal slings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As sling techniques involving passive urethral compression have been successfully employed in the treatment of female stress incontinence, similar techniques have been adapted for use in men. These slings typically employ synthetic mesh to compress the urethra to achieve continence. However, there are limited data on the long-term efficacy of perineal slings in men.</p><p>Contemporary male slings are placed transversely through the obturator foramen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. This technique is analogous to &ldquo;transobturator slings&rdquo; which are used for female stress incontinence. More recently, a &ldquo;quadratic&rdquo; sling has been developed which combines transobturator fixation with an anterior prepubic component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

The artificial urinary sphincter consists of three silicone components: a cuff, a balloon reservoir, and a pump. Each of these components is attached to a length of silicone tubing and connected together during the surgical implant procedure.</p><p>Success rates (use of &le;1 pad daily) have ranged from 59 to 90 percent at follow-up intervals ranging from one to eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Patient satisfaction with this technique is high, even among men with severe stress incontinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. Postoperative wound infection, which occurs in &lt;3 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], can be a disastrous complication as this typically requires removal of the entire device. Urethral erosion of the cuff can also occur. A common cause of late urethral erosion is Foley catheter trauma. Artificial urinary sphincters are more likely to fail in patients with compromised urethras (from prior artificial urinary sphincter placement, radiation therapy, or urethroplasty) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>After artificial urinary sphincter placement, it is vital that urethral instrumentation be kept to a minimum, as such instrumentation may weaken the urethra at the cuff site and cause erosion of the cuff. If catheterization is required, the artificial urinary sphincter must be deactivated, often requiring involvement of a urologist. Teaching the patient to deactivate the device may be useful, as the patient may be able to take responsibility for deactivating it prior to Foley catheter placement.</p><p>When urethral erosion occurs, the cuff must be surgically removed and a Foley catheter placed for a period of two weeks to allow the urethra to heal. Another cuff may then be placed at a later time. To maintain long-term continence, surgical revision of the artificial urinary sphincter is often required. Revisions may be required due to infection, urethral erosion, mechanical malfunction of the device (eg, leak of fluid), or urethral atrophy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9860356\"><span class=\"h4\">Choosing a procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For select men with mild stress incontinence or those who are not candidates for more invasive surgery, transurethral bulking agents may be a reasonable treatment option. Prior injection of bulking agents does not appear to affect the postoperative results of male perineal slings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>] or artificial urinary sphincters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>For most men with persistent and bothersome stress incontinence, the main treatment decision involves choosing between the sling and artificial urinary sphincter. Slings may be preferred in men with limited manual dexterity who may have difficulty manipulating the artificial urinary sphincter, or in those with more mild incontinence. The artificial urinary sphincter is typically a better choice for men with previous pelvic radiation therapy or severe incontinence. Of note, previous artificial urinary sphincter explantation is associated with a high rate of sling failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>], while previous sling placement does not appear to affect the outcome of artificial urinary sphincter placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/urinary-incontinence-in-men/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. For many men, the decision between an artificial urinary sphincter and a perineal sling is ultimately based on patient preference.
