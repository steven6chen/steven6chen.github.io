It is a common complaint in childhood, accounting for 4 per 1000 visits in one pediatric emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-a-limp/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Limp can be caused by both benign and life-threatening conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76343\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76343 \">table 1</a>); the management varies from reassurance to major surgery depending upon the cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-a-limp/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the emergency department or primary care practice, minor trauma predominates as the typical etiology for limp. Observational studies of children without a clear history of trauma who were evaluated in tertiary care centers or orthopedic clinics tend to emphasize serious infectious disease diagnoses such as osteomyelitis or septic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-a-limp/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. One prospective study that evaluated 243 children younger than 14 years of age who presented to a pediatric emergency department with limp and no history of trauma had the following findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-a-limp/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Boys outnumbered girls by almost two to one.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Median age was four years.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The limp was painful in 80 percent of patients with localization to the hip in 34 percent and knee in 19 percent.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient synovitis or irritable hip were the most common diagnoses (40 percent of cases).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients (77 percent) had a benign cause that could be managed without subspecialty follow-up or hospital admission.</p><p/><p>These data suggest that the majority of limping children who undergo emergency evaluation have a benign cause that is self-limiting but a significant proportion of children still require additional diagnostic studies and subspecialty care to diagnose and manage serious underlying etiologies. Although most cases of limp are caused by trauma or benign self-limiting conditions, life- or limb-threatening conditions must be diagnosed promptly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67026\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67026 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-a-limp/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several historical features help identify possible causes for limp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63220\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63220 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-a-limp/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limps of recent onset are typically due to trauma or acute infection.

(See <a href=\"#H3633809612\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The tables summarize the causes of limp, highlighting the common presentations based on location of physical findings, the patient's age and duration of symptoms, or type of gait (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76343\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76343 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51431 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62511\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62511 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the history, the clinician should determine the duration of the limp (acute or chronic), presence of fever, whether there is a history of trauma, any focal site of pain, and associated symptoms such as back pain, incontinence, morning stiffness, or recent illness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63220\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63220 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms that occur at night or wake the child are found more commonly in neoplastic conditions (eg, leukemia, osteogenic sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma) and benign tumors (eg, osteoid osteoma). Ill appearance or significant pain suggests a more serious cause of limp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67026\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67026 \">table 2</a>). Infectious or inflammatory etiologies are often associated with fever. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pain characteristics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'General'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the source of the limp cannot be localized clearly by the history and simple observation (which is often the case in the young or nonverbal child), the examiner must proceed systematically through examination of the central nervous system (CNS), spine, peripheral nervous system, abdomen, hips, knees, ankle, and feet. In addition, the back (especially the paravertebral region), abdomen, and external genitalia should be examined to identify unusual causes of limp (eg, discitis, psoas abscess, pelvic inflammatory disease, or testicular torsion). The examination should proceed from areas of least concern to the site of suspected pathology. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The laboratory evaluation of the child with a limp should be directed by the history and physical examination findings. Laboratory tests usually are <strong>not</strong> indicated in the afebrile child with normal physical examination, especially if the limp is associated with an isolated injury and has been present for less than 24 hours. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count (CBC), acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and C-reactive protein [CRP]), and blood culture are useful in the evaluation of acutely limping patients in whom infection is a possible cause. Lyme studies are also indicated for patients who live in Lyme endemic areas. These studies are also warranted in the evaluation of the afebrile child with a several day history of limp and no abnormalities on plain radiography. Joint aspiration is warranted if septic arthritis is suspected on the basis of a swollen, inflamed joint, the presence of isolated unilateral hip effusion in a febrile child, or painful, limited range of motion at the hip. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest plain radiographs in children who demonstrate a limp on physical examination, even when a history of antecedent trauma and or other localizing abnormalities on physical examination are lacking. Plain radiographs of the areas of concern usually are obtained first because they are readily available and are specific for fractures, destructive lesions, and avascular necrosis. Both anteroposterior and lateral views should be obtained. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Children with isolated limp'</a> above and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Radiologic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In situations where hip pathology is suspected, anteroposterior (AP) and frog leg views of the pelvis are the correct radiographs to obtain. The clinician should <strong>not</strong> order a unilateral hip series because a small slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) could be missed in the absence of direct comparison with the opposite hip. Ultrasonography is an excellent technique for identifying joint effusions of the hip and should be used when plain radiographs are normal but the suspicion of septic hip remains high. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Radiologic evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasonography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is favored over radionuclide scan for diagnosing osteomyelitis, stress fracture (patients with continued limp and pain but normal plain radiographs), and early avascular necrosis (eg, Legg-Calv&eacute;-Perthes disease) because of its superior ability to differentiate among these possible disease states. MRI is also indicated when spine pathology is suggested by physical examination or plain radiographs (eg, discitis, herniated disc, spinal cord anomalies, or spinal tumors). (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The disposition of the child with a limp depends upon the results of the initial evaluation. Specialty consultation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hospital admission should occur for children whose findings indicate life- or limb-threatening conditions. Most children have a benign or nonemergent cause for their limp and can be managed as outpatients with appropriate medical follow-up. (See <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Disposition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic approach to the child with a limp and hip pain is summarized in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62737\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef62737 \">algorithm 1</a>). A history of trauma and the presence of fever are two key decision points in the evaluation of these children.
