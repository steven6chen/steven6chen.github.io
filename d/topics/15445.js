The availability of screening tests allows detection of preinvasive disease, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). CIN can be treated to prevent progression to invasive cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the etiology of most cervical cancers. </p><p>Screening for cervical cancer is of particular importance for women and adolescent girls infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The incidence of CIN, as confirmed by colposcopy, is four to five times higher in HIV-infected women and adolescents compared to HIV-negative women and adolescents with high-risk sexual behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].

Median follow-up was about two years. Cytology (&ge;ASCUS) and colposcopy had equivalent sensitivity for detecting women with CIN 2 or worse (100 and 98 percent, respectively). HPV testing had similar sensitivity (91 percent), but was much less specific (50 percent versus 65 percent for cytology and 63 percent for colposcopy). Based on these findings, the authors concluded cytology was preferable to HPV testing or colposcopy for screening HIV-infected women for cervical cancer.</p><p/><p>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, and HIV Medicine Association have formed the Panel on Opportunistic Infections in HIV-Infected Adults and Adolescents and issued consensus guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents, including human papillomavirus (HPV)-related disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Two cervical screening assessments initially is prudent for HIV-infected women, since intraepithelial neoplasia is not uncommon and can develop rapidly in these women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/3,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,27</a>], and because high-grade lesions may be missed with a single smear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The efficacy of annual cervical cytology after consistently negative results was illustrated in a study of 942 HIV-infected women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. After three consecutive negative cytology results, after 15 months, there were no cases of precancer (CIN 2,3, atypical glandular cells favor neoplasia, or adenocarcinoma in situ), and after 39 months, precancer was found in 2 percent of women.</p><p>A cost-effectiveness analysis using a simulated clinical practice in the United States also supports this recommendation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This report compared six screening strategies in HIV-infected women: no screening, annual Pap smear, annual Pap smear after two negative smears obtained six months apart, semiannual Pap smears, annual colposcopy, and semiannual colposcopy. Annual Pap smear after two negative smears obtained six months apart offered quality adjusted life expectancy benefits at a cost comparable to other clinical preventive interventions. Semiannual Pap smear screening provided additional quality adjusted life years (QALYs) but at significantly greater cost, while colposcopy added significant cost but provided no further benefit.</p><p>Women with advanced HIV disease (particularly those controlled with antiretroviral therapy) appear to be more likely to have persistent HPV and CIN than those with early HIV infections; however, there are no objective data showing that more aggressive screening is indicated for these women or affects outcome.</p><p>It has been suggested that the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) may reverse or lessen the severity of cervical neoplasia in HIV-infected women, as is the case with other AIDS-related malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. However, multiple studies of this hypothesis have yielded mixed results, and the incidence of invasive cervical neoplasia appears to be unchanged in the potent ART era [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up of normal results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with two consecutive normal cytological examinations, we recommend that annual follow-up include a thorough visual inspection of the anus, vulva, and vagina, as well as the cervix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of abnormal results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology 2006 consensus guidelines advise that immunosuppressed women, including women who are HIV positive, with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) may be managed the same as women in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Women in this population do not appear to be at increased risk of CIN 2,3 or HPV positivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Other cytologic abnormalities in women infected with HIV should also be evaluated in the same manner as in other women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cytology-evaluation-of-atypical-squamous-cells-asc-us-and-asc-h#H171887073\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical cytology: Evaluation of atypical squamous cells (ASC-US and ASC-H)&quot;, section on 'Immunocompromised women'</a>.) </p><p>Although rates of cytologic glandular abnormalities appear to increase with the degree of immunosuppression in HIV-infected women, glandular neoplasia is rare. This was illustrated in a large cohort study that included almost 50,000 Pap tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Rates of glandular abnormalities on cervical cytology did not differ significantly in HIV-infected (0.8 percent) compared with HIV-negative women (0.6 percent). Among HIV-infected women, on the other hand, the rate of cytologic glandular abnormalities increased significantly with decreasing CD4 lymphocyte count <span class=\"nowrap\">(&gt;500/mm3:</span> 0.6 percent; 250 to <span class=\"nowrap\">500/mm3:</span> 0.8 percent; <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;250/mm3:</span> 1.0 percent). Ultimately, cervical biopsy found only one HIV-infected woman with cervical adenocarcinoma and one HIV-negative woman with glandular atypia; other women had negative histology or squamous abnormalities and showed no significant difference by HIV serostatus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening after hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For HIV-infected women who have undergone hysterectomy, there are few data to guide follow-up and about the risk of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) or vaginal cancer. Women without HIV infection and with no history of CIN 2,3 who undergo total hysterectomy for benign disease have a near zero risk of developing VAIN, so vaginal cytologic screening is not recommended, and those with a history of CIN 2,3 are advised to undergo screening with vaginal cytology for 20 years after the last finding of CIN 2,3. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-cervical-cancer#H3215104\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for cervical cancer&quot;, section on 'Prior hysterectomy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-treatment-and-follow-up#H518743\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Treatment and follow-up&quot;, section on 'Posthysterectomy'</a>.)</p><p>Available studies in HIV-infected women include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 102 HIV-infected women who underwent hysterectomy for a variety of indications and reported that 16 developed VAIN within the first few years after their surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Nineteen of these women were known to have CIN or cervical cancer at the time of hysterectomy, seven were known not to have any CIN, and there was no information on the other 76 patients. Of note, the seven women without CIN had normal vaginal cytology during median follow-up of three years. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective cohort study evaluated 238 HIV-infected women with no history of CIN or cervical cancer who underwent hysterectomy for benign indications and then had cytology; median follow-up was 16 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Posthysterectomy abnormal cytology was found in 31 percent and among those who had vaginal biopsies, results were: normal (28 percent), VAIN 1 (43 percent), VAIN 2,3 (29 percent), and no vaginal cancers. Women who were on antiretroviral therapy at any time after hysterectomy were significantly less likely to have an abnormal cytology result (9 versus 91 percent). &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, a long-term follow-up study of HIV-infected women treated for CIN with hysterectomy showed no difference in cancer incidence or mortality compared to the local general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p>Based on the available data, no formal recommendation regarding Pap smear screening after hysterectomy in HIV-infected women can be made. In our practice, for HIV-infected women who have undergone hysterectomy for a reason other than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or invasive cancer, and are medically stable, we do not do routine pap smear screening. However, if the patient&rsquo;s HIV-related disease begins to progress, as measured by rising viral load, falling CD4 level, opportunistic infection, or they are noncompliant with antiretroviral therapy, we do a pap test and pelvic examination at that point, as well as annual screening from then on.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A cost-effectiveness study evaluated the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for cervical cancer screening in HIV-infected women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. For HIV-infected women on antiretroviral therapy, adding HPV testing to the two cervical cytology smears obtained in the first year and then modifying subsequent screening based upon these results (cervical cytology screening every six months for women with detectable HPV DNA and annual screening for all others) was more effective and cost effective than annual screening alone.</p><p>Others have also found a low risk of cytological abnormalities in immunocompromised women who test negative for high-risk subtypes of HPV and have normal CD4 counts. A cohort study showed that HIV-infected women (mean age 37 years) with CD4 counts over <span class=\"nowrap\">500/mcL,</span> normal cervical cytology, and HPV-negative test results at baseline were at low risk of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in the next three years, and their risk was equivalent to that of HIV-negative women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, a study of 103 women who were HIV positive and had CD4 counts less than 500 reported that the presence of a high-risk HPV subtype, although strongly associated with the presence of any CIN, only slightly improved the sensitivity and predictive value of baseline screening when compared to cytologic screening alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The lack of substantial benefit was most likely due to the high prevalence of HPV infection in HIV-infected women. It appears that HIV-infected women are more likely than other women to be infected with high-risk HPV subtypes other than 16 and 18 and are likely to have persistent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p>We feel the use of HPV testing to determine the frequency of subsequent screening in HIV-infected women is a reasonable approach; women who test negative for HPV and have two negative initial cervical cytology results could undergo cytological screening yearly (as discussed above), while those with high-risk HPV DNA would have cervical cytology every six months. This is different from the recommendation for HIV-negative women in whom prolongation of the screening interval to not less than three years is recommended if both cytology and HPV results are normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-screening-tests-techniques-for-cervical-cytology-and-human-papillomavirus-testing#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical cancer screening tests: Techniques for cervical cytology and human papillomavirus testing&quot;, section on 'HPV testing'</a>.)</p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Cobas HPV test for use in co-testing or as a standalone method of screening for women over age 24. This was based on a study of over 40,000 women, which showed that the test was safe and effective for the new indication for use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, this study included no known HIV-infected subjects. As discussed above, historical cervical screening techniques may be less effective in HIV-infected women. We therefore cannot currently endorse the use of the Cobas HPV test as a standalone screening technique for this population. Additional large clinical trials are needed to determine whether subgroups of HIV-infected women, such as those who are HPV negative <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have normal CD4 counts, can be screened for cervical cancer at screening intervals longer than one year. In the meantime, annual screening with more frequent evaluation of those with abnormal cytology or high-risk HPV types is recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">COLPOSCOPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many clinicians perform routine colposcopy in HIV-infected women, either with the initial cervical cytology or annually. The rationale for this approach is:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>These women are usually seen in the health care system more often than once a year for other reasons, so they would not require an additional visit (with its associated costs and inconvenience) just for screening.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rate of noncompliance is high, thus, the potential need for a return visit for colposcopy is eliminated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A higher rate of concurrent vulvar, vaginal, and anal neoplasias occurs in this group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Even mildly abnormal smears are associated with a high rate of histologic CIN (38 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>Colposcopic examination of the vagina and vulva, as well as the cervix, should be included in the evaluation because of the higher risk of multifocal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Cervical cytology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with two consecutive normal cytological examinations, we recommend that annual follow-up include a thorough visual inspection of the anus, vulva, and vagina, as well as the cervix. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up of normal results'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no consensus as to whether human papillomavirus (HPV) testing should be performed routinely on HIV-infected women. We suggest the use of HPV testing to determine the frequency of subsequent cervical cancer screening in these women; women who test negative for HPV and have two negative initial cervical cytology results could undergo cytological screening yearly, while those with high-risk HPV DNA should have cervical cytology every six months. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Human papillomavirus testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend a screening colposcopy at initial evaluation. The need for subsequent examinations is based upon cervical cytology results.
