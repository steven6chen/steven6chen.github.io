Pancoast mistakenly believed that these neoplasms arose from embryonal rests of the fifth branchial cleft; other investigators subsequently recognized the pulmonary origin of the vast majority of these malignancies.</p><p>Since Pancoast original reports, the terms &quot;Pancoast tumors,&quot; &quot;superior sulcus tumors,&quot; or &quot;superior pulmonary sulcus tumors&quot; have been applied to neoplasms located at the apical pleuropulmonary groove, adjacent to the subclavian vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F89038\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89038 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/superior-pulmonary-sulcus-pancoast-tumors/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The actual pulmonary sulcus comprises the thoracic costovertebral gutter on either side of the vertebral column and is limited by the arch of the first rib superiorly and the diaphragmatic insertion inferiorly. Tumors located at the upper part of the pulmonary sulcus near the thoracic inlet may correctly be regarded as superior sulcus tumors, although the inferior margins of the superior sulcus are not well defined.</p><p>The diagnosis and management of tumors arising within the superior sulcus are reviewed here. General issues regarding lung cancer and management of stage II and stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are reviewed separately.

Pain is produced by invasion of the brachial plexus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extension of the tumor into the parietal pleura, endothoracic fascia, first and second ribs, or vertebral bodies. Pain can progress and radiate up to the head and neck, or down to the medial aspect of the scapula, axilla, anterior chest, or ipsilateral arm in the distribution of the ulnar nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/superior-pulmonary-sulcus-pancoast-tumors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Patients frequently receive treatment for presumed cervical osteoarthritis or shoulder bursitis, resulting in a delay in diagnosis of five to ten months in some series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/superior-pulmonary-sulcus-pancoast-tumors/abstract/8,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12-14</a>].

Its prevalence in patients with superior sulcus tumors has ranged from 14 to 50 percent in different series (and up to 83 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/superior-pulmonary-sulcus-pancoast-tumors/abstract/5,7,8,10,12,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8,10,12,14-16</a>].</p><p>Ipsilateral flushing and increased sweating of the face may occur before the development of the full Horner's syndrome, presumably due to irritation of the sympathetic chain by the tumor prior to frank invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/superior-pulmonary-sulcus-pancoast-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Ipsilateral complex regional pain syndrome (reflex sympathetic dystrophy) and facial pain similar to paroxysmal hemicrania rarely may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/superior-pulmonary-sulcus-pancoast-tumors/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

This is typically carried out through en bloc resection of the tumor and the chest wall, and, depending upon the extent of local invasion, may require resection of the paravertebral sympathetic chain, stellate ganglion, lower trunks of the brachial plexus, subclavian artery, or portions of the thoracic vertebrae. One of two surgical approaches may be utilized:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The posterior approach, also termed the Paulson operation, is performed via a long incision along the medial edge of the scapula starting between the second or third thoracic vertebra and the scapula, extending underneath its inferior tip, and ending at the anterior axillary line [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/superior-pulmonary-sulcus-pancoast-tumors/abstract/2,83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,83,84</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anterior transcervical approach involves a long L-shaped incision that extends from the mandibular angle along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle down to the suprasternal notch and laterally under the medial half of the clavicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/superior-pulmonary-sulcus-pancoast-tumors/abstract/83,85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,85,86</a>]. This technique is generally used for tumors located anteriorly at the thoracic inlet, particularly those invading the subclavian vessels. A variation of this approach, the anterior &ldquo;hemi-clamshell&rdquo; incision, permits sparing of the clavicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/superior-pulmonary-sulcus-pancoast-tumors/abstract/87-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">87-89</a>].</p><p/><p>The extent of lung resection is determined by the size and location of the primary tumor and the patient's underlying pulmonary function. Lobectomy is generally considered the preferable procedure for lung cancers, with fewer local recurrences and better survival when compared with sublobar resections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/superior-pulmonary-sulcus-pancoast-tumors/abstract/26,83,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,83,90</a>].</p><p>A combined thoracic-neurosurgical approach is necessary in treating tumors that invade the brachial plexus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/superior-pulmonary-sulcus-pancoast-tumors/abstract/16,91-94\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,91-94</a>].

Surgery is contraindicated by extensive invasion of the brachial plexus, the intervertebral foramina, or soft tissues at the base of the neck; by mediastinal perinodal involvement; and by venous obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/superior-pulmonary-sulcus-pancoast-tumors/abstract/2,6,11,14,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,11,14,95</a>].

Resection of T1 and T2 nerve roots generally does not result in major clinical sequelae.

In the setting of non-Pancoast stage III NSCLC, concurrent chemoradiotherapy has been shown to be superior to RT alone and has become the standard of care.

However, it is difficult to compare results with RT alone to those obtained with combined modality therapy, since many studies of primary RT have included patients with unfavorable prognostic factors and unresectable tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/superior-pulmonary-sulcus-pancoast-tumors/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Furthermore, many series include patients treated before the era of imaging with CT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> MRI, who were thus less adequately staged.</p><p>While resection is generally accepted as a component of treatment for locally advanced NSCLC, its value is uncertain in patients with stage IIIA (N2) disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F80099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80099 \">table 3</a>). Interim reports of the major randomized prospective study addressing the value of resection when added to chemoradiotherapy have failed to demonstrate a statistically significant survival advantage for the addition of resection to chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced non-Pancoast NSCLC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/superior-pulmonary-sulcus-pancoast-tumors/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].

The presence of Horner's syndrome, extension of the tumor into the base of the neck, vertebral bodies or the great vessels, or involvement of the mediastinal lymph nodes is associated with a worse prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/superior-pulmonary-sulcus-pancoast-tumors/abstract/100,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,103</a>]. Longer duration of symptoms has also been found to adversely affect the prognosis, probably because of an association with more advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/superior-pulmonary-sulcus-pancoast-tumors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>A good performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 \">table 4</a>) and weight loss of no more than 5 percent of total body weight are associated with better survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/superior-pulmonary-sulcus-pancoast-tumors/abstract/10,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,28</a>]. Local control of the tumor by radiation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgery as well as the achievement of pain relief after treatment are encouraging and suggest a better prognosis. Most studies have not found an association between histologic subtype and survival.</p><p>A pathologic complete response after induction chemoradiotherapy has generally been correlated with better survival. A study from the Netherlands performed fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission <span class=\"nowrap\">tomography/computed</span> tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(FDG-PET/CT)</span> before and after induction therapy. Changes in standardized uptake values (SUV) were predictive of an excellent pathologic response (&le;10 percent viable cells) and correlated with residual tumor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/superior-pulmonary-sulcus-pancoast-tumors/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">POST-THERAPY SURVEILLANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evidence from these studies does not establish a clear cut benefit for aggressive surveillance following treatment with curative intent.
