The lesions show papillary proliferation, cyst formation, and varying degrees of cellular atypia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-papillary-mucinous-neoplasm-of-the-pancreas-ipmn-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>IPMNs may involve the main pancreatic duct, the branch ducts, or both. Whereas patients with branch-duct lesions are at lower risk for developing malignancy (approximately 20 percent at 10 years), patients with IPMNs involving the main duct are at high risk (approximately 70 percent). As a result, these lesions need to be accurately diagnosed and characterized so that appropriate treatment can be recommended.

Additional evaluation with endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration may be needed to confirm a diagnosis or to assess for malignant features. The diagnostic approach to pancreatic cystic neoplasms is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreatic cystic neoplasms: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62273575\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION FOR MALIGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of a patient with an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) aims to determine if the patient has or is at high-risk of developing a malignancy. Resection is typically recommended for IPMNs with high-grade dysplasia (carcinoma in situ), IPMNs that have progressed to invasive carcinoma (also referred to as invasive IPMN or malignant IPMN), and IPMNs with features concerning for malignancy or that are at high risk for developing malignancy. IPMNs not meeting these criteria are typically followed with surveillance imaging. (See <a href=\"#H5510671\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.) </p><p>While the approach to evaluating IPMNs is similar to the initial evaluation of pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs), additional testing is often indicated because IPMNs have known malignant potential (as opposed to PCNs in general, which may or may not have malignant potential based on the cyst type). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H62271655\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreatic cystic neoplasms: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56725049\"><span class=\"h2\">Cross-sectional imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or a pancreatic protocol computed tomography (CT) scan are typically the first imaging tests used to diagnose and characterize IPMN (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51921\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51921 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F101892\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef101892 \">image 2</a>). The studies can assess the neoplasm and its relationship to surrounding structures, may suggest there is lymph node involvement (scans can show enlargement, which suggests lymph node involvement, but they cannot confirm that nodes are involved), and can detect metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-papillary-mucinous-neoplasm-of-the-pancreas-ipmn-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p>Both MRCP and CT are capable of detecting mural nodules. A CT scan finding of &gt;3 mm mural nodules within an IPMN or the duct is highly suggestive of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-papillary-mucinous-neoplasm-of-the-pancreas-ipmn-evaluation-and-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Compared with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), MRCP is more sensitive for differentiating mural nodules from mucin globs since mucin has the same signal intensity as pancreatic fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-papillary-mucinous-neoplasm-of-the-pancreas-ipmn-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3,7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7-10</a>]. MRCP is also superior for demonstrating the internal architecture of the main duct and the extent of IPMN. However, MRCP is inferior to ERCP in demonstrating peripheral ductal abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-papillary-mucinous-neoplasm-of-the-pancreas-ipmn-evaluation-and-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] and in the ability to obtain tissue or perform therapeutic interventions. The most sensitive test for the detection of mural nodules is an endoscopic ultrasound.

The AGA guideline recommends patients undergo further evaluation only if a cyst has two or more specific worrisome features (size &ge;3 cm, a solid component, or a dilated main pancreatic duct). However, the AGA guideline points out that there is insufficient evidence to make definitive recommendations and that the approach may need to be individualized on a case-by-case basis. In addition, some data now suggest that if the AGA guidelines are applied, many IPMNs with adenocarcinoma or high-grade dysplasia will be missed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-papillary-mucinous-neoplasm-of-the-pancreas-ipmn-evaluation-and-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H62273797\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreatic cystic neoplasms: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Indications for additional evaluation'</a>).

The choice of surgery will be determined by the location of the tumor and the extent of involvement of the gland. It is not clearly established that multifocality corresponds to a higher risk of invasive cancer, and in most cases with more than one lesion, the dominant or concerning lesion(s) are resected and the other(s) are observed with follow-up imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-papillary-mucinous-neoplasm-of-the-pancreas-ipmn-evaluation-and-management/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

However, the results of this study should be viewed in light of the fact that it was a retrospective series and that the indications for surgery were not discussed. Therefore, the study is at risk for bias with regard to which patients underwent surgery. In addition, the study only used CT scans for diagnosis and not EUS (which may detect smaller cysts missed by CT), so the study results and conclusions should be viewed with caution. </p><p>Resection of the tumor (IPMN with high-grade dysplasia or an invasive carcinoma) can be attempted in patients with no imaging or endoscopic evidence of local vascular invasion or distant metastases. The most common operation is pancreaticoduodenectomy (70 percent) because most tumors are in the head of the pancreas. Examination of frozen sections of the resection margins during surgery can determine tumor extent and the need for further surgical resection, bearing in mind that, given the &quot;field defect&quot; nature of IPMN, a negative surgical margin does not preclude the presence of neoplasia in the remnant pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-papillary-mucinous-neoplasm-of-the-pancreas-ipmn-evaluation-and-management/abstract/46,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,50</a>].

Overall survival was worse among patients who were treated with surgery alone compared with those who received adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy; hazard ratio 1.36, 95% CI 1.17-1.58). On stratified analysis, adjuvant therapy was associated with improved survival in patients with TNM stage II or <span class=\"nowrap\">III/VI</span> disease, positive lymph node status, positive resection margins, or poorly differentiated tumors. Adjuvant therapy was not associated with a survival advantage for patients with stage I disease and lymph node-negative disease. </p><p>The benefit of adjuvant therapy for patients with invasive carcinoma arising from IPMN was also examined in a retrospective series with 70 patients. Forty patients received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (mostly external beam radiotherapy with concomitant infusional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a>, followed by fluorouracil chemotherapy alone), while 30 patients had resection only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-papillary-mucinous-neoplasm-of-the-pancreas-ipmn-evaluation-and-management/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Invasive carcinoma was present at the resection margin in 16 percent of cases, and 50 percent had involved lymph nodes. Despite the fact that patients receiving adjuvant therapy were more likely to have adverse prognostic features (nodal metastases, perineural invasion, and stage II or III rather than stage I disease), the two-year survival rate after surgery with chemotherapy was similar to that seen in those who did not receive chemoradiotherapy (56 versus 59 percent). In multivariable analysis after adjusting for major confounders, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was associated with a 57 percent reduction in mortality after pancreaticoduodenectomy.</p><p>While it appears reasonable to offer postresection adjuvant therapy to patients with IPMNs that have progressed to invasive carcinoma, the identification of the specific subgroups that benefit from postoperative therapy and the optimal treatment strategy (chemoradiotherapy versus chemotherapy alone) is undefined.

However, this study may overestimate the risk since the patients included were those with indications for surgery. For patients not undergoing surgery, we obtain a magnetic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or CT scan in one year.

If the EUS findings or cytology are inconclusive or if a BD-IPMN is &gt;30 mm, we typically suggest surgery for patients who are surgical candidates and have a life expectancy &ge;10 years. For all other patients, surveillance is suggested. </p><p>The optimal surveillance approach is unclear. In its guideline, the AGA suggests a magnetic resonance imaging scan in one year and then every two years for a total of five years for patients with pancreatic cysts provided there is no change in cyst size and the cyst does not develop other worrisome characteristics (eg, a solid component or dilation of the main pancreatic duct) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-papillary-mucinous-neoplasm-of-the-pancreas-ipmn-evaluation-and-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. On the other hand, the Sendai consensus guidelines suggest variable (but more aggressive) surveillance intervals based on the size of the IPMN (ranging from CT every two to three years for cysts &lt;1 cm to EUS every three to six months for cysts &gt;3 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-papillary-mucinous-neoplasm-of-the-pancreas-ipmn-evaluation-and-management/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Our approach is similar to the AGA guideline, though it is slightly more conservative given the known malignant potential of IPMNs (eg, we do not discontinue surveillance after five years if a patient remains a good surgical candidate). </p><p>We base our approach on the size of the IPMN:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ge;30 mm: Repeat MRCP or CT in one year.

However, if any of these features is present in the resected specimen, survival outcomes are similar to those of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

Five-year survival rates for node-negative IPMN-associated adenocarcinoma and ductal cancer were 35 and 17 percent, respectively, whereas the corresponding values for node-positive disease were 9 and 7 percent. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2097125286\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

It may involve the main pancreatic duct, the branch ducts, or both. Patients with IPMN involving the main duct are at increased risk of cancer compared with patients who have side-branch IPMN. (See <a href=\"#H5512616\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to the diagnosis of pancreatic cystic neoplasms typically starts with cross-sectional imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography [MRCP] or computed tomography [CT]). Additional evaluation with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) may be needed to confirm a diagnosis or to assess for malignant features. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancreatic-cystic-neoplasms-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pancreatic cystic neoplasms: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of a patient with IPMN aims to determine if the patient has or is at high-risk of developing a malignancy. MRI with MRCP or a pancreatic protocol CT scan are typically the first imaging tests used to diagnose and characterize IPMN (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51921\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51921 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F101892\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef101892 \">image 2</a>). These studies can assess the neoplasm and its relationship to surrounding structures, may suggest lymph node involvement, and can detect metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-papillary-mucinous-neoplasm-of-the-pancreas-ipmn-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H62273575\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for malignancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional evaluation with EUS-FNA may not be needed if there are clear indications for surgery demonstrated on cross-sectional imaging, such as IPMN with a main pancreatic duct diameter &ge;10 mm, an enhancing solid component within the cyst, or if the patient has obstructive jaundice or other symptoms attributable to the cyst. (See <a href=\"#H5510671\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients without an indication for surgery, additional evaluation of the IPMN with EUS-FNA is needed if there are concerning findings on cross-sectional imaging such as (see <a href=\"#H56725098\" class=\"local\">'Indications for additional evaluation'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>IPMN size &ge;30 mm </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Thickened or enhancing cyst walls on imaging</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Presence of a non-enhancing mural nodule</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Associated pancreatitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A dilated main pancreatic duct that is 5 to 9 mm in diameter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An abrupt change in the caliber of the pancreatic duct with distal pancreatic atrophy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The optimal approach to the evaluation of IPMNs &ge;10 mm but &lt;30 mm in size with no other concerning features is unclear. Our approach is to offer patients the option of undergoing additional evaluation with EUS-FNA if the patient is particularly concerned about malignancy. If additional evaluation is not performed, we follow the patient with surveillance imaging. For IPMNs that are &lt;10 mm in size, we obtain surveillance imaging. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resection is typically recommended for IPMNs with high-grade dysplasia, IPMNs that have progressed to invasive carcinoma, and IPMNs with features concerning for malignancy or that are at high risk for developing malignancy. We suggest following the approach outlined in the algorithms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F104502\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104502 \">algorithm 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F104512\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104512 \">algorithm 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, optimal management is not clear and other groups advocate different approaches. (See <a href=\"#H5510671\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because of the significant morbidity and mortality associated with pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy, the decision to recommend surgery should take into account factors such as the patient's age and general health, the malignant risk of the lesion, and the suspicion for malignancy. Cysts not meeting criteria for resection are typically followed with surveillance imaging.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraductal-papillary-mucinous-neoplasm-of-the-pancreas-ipmn-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Longnecker DS, Adsay NV, Fernandez-del Castillo C, et al.
