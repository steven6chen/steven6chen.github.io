Obesity is a chronic disease that is increasing in prevalence in adults, adolescents, and children and is now considered to be a global epidemic. Screening for obesity can identify high-risk patients who may not otherwise receive counseling about health risks, lifestyle changes, obesity treatment options, and risk factor reduction. Evaluation of an overweight or obese patient should include both clinical and laboratory studies; the combined information is used to characterize the type and severity of obesity, determine health risk, and provide a basis for selecting therapy.</p><p>The prevalence of obesity, the approach to screening, and the clinical evaluation of obesity in adults will be reviewed here. The health risks associated with obesity and approach to treatment are discussed in detail separately.

Prevalence data have been collected in two ways: annual telephone surveys conducted by state Departments of Health in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, GA (the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System [BRFSS]) and direct measurement of height and weight in field surveys by the National Center for Health Statistics as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).</p><p>Data from BRFSS, the telephone survey, reported a prevalence that was approximately two-thirds that of the NHANES surveys. This could be because people underreport their weight, overreport their height, or both during the telephone surveys.

Patients with abdominal obesity (also called central adiposity, visceral, android, or male-type obesity) are at increased risk for heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-prevalence-screening-and-evaluation/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>]. Waist circumference is used with BMI for identifying adults at increased risk for morbidity and mortality, particularly in the BMI range 25 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span>. As noted, waist circumference measurements in patients with BMI &ge;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</span> </sup>are unnecessary as they do not add additional risk information.</p><p>The waist circumference is measured with a flexible tape placed on a horizontal plane at the level of the iliac crest as seen from the anterior view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F77584\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77584 \">figure 1</a>).

The risk for any given degree of obesity seems to be greater in patients whose obesity begins before the age of 40 years, probably because of the longer time period over which comorbid conditions, such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension, can develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-prevalence-screening-and-evaluation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Weight gain after age 18 years is also important. Even very modest weight gain (&ge;5 kg) after age 18 years in women and after age 20 years in men increases the risk of CHD and type 2 diabetes at all levels of initial BMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-adults-prevalence-screening-and-evaluation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

This is done by measuring body mass index (BMI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63600%7EENDO%2F74762\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63600 graphicRef74762 \">table 1A-B</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-quetelets-index-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) at the routine physical examination. In addition, we suggest measuring waist circumference in those with BMI between 25 and 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</span> </sup>(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>)<sup> </sup>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F77584\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77584 \">figure 1</a>) as abdominal adiposity (and associated risk) may not be captured in this BMI range. Waist circumference measurement is unnecessary in patients with BMI &ge;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span>. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Measurements'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BMI classifications are based upon risk of cardiometabolic disease. The classification is used for identifying adults at increased risk for morbidity and mortality due to obesity. However, the relationship between percent body fat and BMI is different among different ethnic groups. In Caucasian, Hispanic, and black individuals, overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 to 29.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> and obesity as a BMI of &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span>. The current cutoffs underestimate the risk associated with obesity in the Asian and South Asian population. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'BMI-based classifications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Waist circumference is a measurement of abdominal obesity and provides risk information that is not accounted for by BMI. Patients with abdominal obesity (also called central adiposity, visceral, android, or male-type obesity) are at increased risk for heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. A waist circumference of &ge;40 in (102 cm) for men and &ge;35 in (88 cm) for women is considered elevated and indicative of increased cardiometabolic risk. In Asian females a waist circumference &ge;31 in (80 cm) and in Asian males a value &ge;35 in (90 cm) are considered abnormal. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Waist circumference'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In individuals with BMI &ge;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> or a waist circumference &ge;35 in (88 cm) (women) or &ge;40 in (102 cm) (men), we suggest further evaluation to assess overall risk status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69717\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69717 \">figure 2</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Assessment of an individual's overall risk status includes determining the degree of overweight (BMI) and the presence of abdominal obesity (waist circumference), cardiometabolic risk factors, obstructive sleep apnea, symptomatic osteoarthritis, and other comorbidities. The evaluation includes a history, physical examination, and measurement of fasting glucose (or glycated hemoglobin [A1C]), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), liver enzymes, and fasting lipids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69717\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69717 \">figure 2</a>). Subsequent intervention, if necessary, is based upon overall risk assessment. The coexistence of several diseases, including established coronary heart disease (CHD), other atherosclerotic disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and sleep apnea places patients in a very high-risk category for subsequent mortality. (See <a href=\"#H13187459\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of the obese patient'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many factors contribute to the development of obesity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55594\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55594 \">table 2</a>). However, most cases of obesity are related to behaviors such as a sedentary lifestyle and increased caloric intake. Although secondary causes of obesity are uncommon, they should be considered and ruled out, typically with history and physical examination. (See <a href=\"#H13187465\" class=\"local\">'Investigating the cause'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All individuals who would benefit from weight loss should receive counseling on diet, physical activity, behavioral modification, and goals for weight loss. Individuals who do not need to lose weight can be counseled regarding prevention of weight gain. The relationship between BMI and risk allows identification of several levels that can be used to guide further selection of therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F93424\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef93424 \">algorithm 1</a>).
