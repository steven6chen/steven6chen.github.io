This disorder involves chronic inflammation and fibroblast proliferation, with excessive extracellular matrix deposition. Untreated patients may develop severe complications or progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Retroperitoneal fibrosis is also sometimes associated with venous or arterial occlusion due to compression or abdominal aortic aneurysms, if in the setting of chronic periaortitis. In addition to medical therapy for the retroperitoneal fibrosis, these situations may require endovascular or surgical management. The management of these issues requires consultation with the appropriate specialists. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis is reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, and diagnosis of this disorder are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH TO THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of therapy are to relieve the obstruction caused by fibrosis, stop the progression of the fibrotic process, and prevent recurrence.</p><p>If the retroperitoneal fibrosis is due to a secondary cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74731\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74731 \">table 1</a>), treatment is aimed at the underlying etiology. If the disease is idiopathic, we initiate immunosuppressive therapy.</p><p>Although some patients may respond to medical therapy within a few weeks, the response is unpredictable, and continued obstruction of the urinary tract may cause irreversible damage. Thus, if significant obstruction of the urinary tract is present, immediate relief of obstruction is advised, using either an open surgical, percutaneous, or endoureteral approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-obstruction-and-hydronephrosis#H1323380494\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction and hydronephrosis&quot;, section on 'Predicting recovery'</a>.)</p><p>On the other hand, procedures to relieve obstruction may be associated with significant risks and complications, including ureteric leakage, thromboembolism, and recurrent fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, patients who have mild, unilateral hydronephrosis, but who do not have significant impairment in renal function, can be closely followed with medical therapy alone (eg, with plasma creatinine concentration and renal ultrasound) and then later referred for surgical decompression of the urinary tract if there is deterioration of kidney function or no improvement or worsening of the hydronephrosis. In most cases, the initial approach will combine upper urinary tract decompression and medical therapy.</p><p>A variety of medical therapies, including glucocorticoids, other immunosuppressive agents, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>, used alone or in combination, are available to treat idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/1,3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-7</a>]. Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERVENTION IN PATIENTS WITH URINARY TRACT OBSTRUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients presenting with renal failure due to obstruction of the urinary tract, or if one kidney is severely obstructed, even if renal function is normal, should undergo upper urinary tract decompression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H84999994\"><span class=\"h2\">Selection of an interventional procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reversal of urinary tract obstruction in retroperitoneal fibrosis can be performed by cystoscopy with placement of in-dwelling double-J stents situated in the renal pelvis and bladder, percutaneously, with placement of percutaneous nephrostomy tubes, or via an open approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Percutaneous nephrostomy allows monitoring the response to therapy with descending ureterography while endoureteral stents may be associated with a better quality of life; however, stents and nephrostomies have comparable complications rates (eg, infection, obstruction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Some authorities have advocated an initial open surgical approach in all patients since it can provide simultaneous relief of mechanical obstruction in combination with an open biopsy and exploration to exclude malignancies (eg, lymphoma, other primary retroperitoneal cancer, or metastatic cancer) as the etiology of the fibrotic process.</p><p>However, patients who have a typical localization of the fibrotic mass and no clinical or laboratory indicators of a malignant process are unlikely to require an open biopsy or open surgery if the mass regresses sufficiently with medical therapy to relieve the obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Thus, we believe open surgery should be reserved for the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Technical difficulties or complications with other cystoscopic or endoscopic obstruction-relieving maneuvers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiologic, laboratory, or clinical findings suggesting underlying malignancy to obtain a definitive diagnosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of regression of the retroperitoneal mass after medical therapy with persistent encasement of the ureters or other structures</p><p/><p>When surgery is performed, it consists of open exploration with ureterolysis, although laparoscopy has also been reported as a feasible approach and may be associated with a shorter hospital stay and reduced need for blood transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. After ureterolysis is accomplished, the encased ureters are manipulated to prevent recurrent obstruction. Different techniques have been used either alone or in combination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wrapping the ureters with omental fat.

In the case of drug-induced retroperitoneal fibrosis, discontinuation of the offending agent is mandatory and often leads to improvement or resolution within a few months.</p><p>Although there are no data, in our experience, therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> may be beneficial in drug-induced disease if there are severe disease manifestations, such as severe symptoms and ureteral obstruction, or there is no significant improvement on computed tomography (CT) scan by three months after discontinuation of the drug (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis&quot;, section on 'Etiology and risk factors'</a>). When treating patients who have drug-induced retroperitoneal fibrosis with prednisone therapy, we use the same protocol that we do for treatment of idiopathic disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F115909\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115909 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H85000215\" class=\"local\">'Medical treatment of idiopathic disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85000215\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical treatment of idiopathic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of medical therapies may be utilized in patients with idiopathic disease. These include glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive agents. We initiate therapy with glucocorticoids alone, beginning as soon as the diagnosis is made (even the same day as urologic intervention).</p><p>In patients who have not responded adequately to glucocorticoids after approximately four weeks of therapy, we prefer to add either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>.

If an interventional procedure is not absolutely necessary, some investigators have advocated using glucocorticoids alone since these procedures may be associated with significant risks and complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Intervention in patients with urinary tract obstruction'</a> above.)</p><p>The best data supporting the use of glucocorticoids as initial therapy come from a trial in which 36 of 39 patients with idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis who responded to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> induction therapy (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for one month) were randomly assigned to a tapering dose of prednisone or a fixed dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> for an additional eight months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The primary endpoint was relapse of disease, defined as the new onset or recurrence of one or more of the following three findings: hydronephrosis, a 20 percent or larger increase in the size of a retroperitoneal mass, or symptoms (eg, back or abdominal pain, constipation) in combination with a 50 percent or greater increase in C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. At the end of eight months, the relapse rate was significantly lower in patients receiving prednisone therapy (6 versus 39 percent). Five of the seven patients who relapsed during tamoxifen therapy were switched to prednisone therapy, and each of these individuals achieved remission. All patients were followed for an additional 18 months after termination of study therapy. Through 26 months, the relapse rate was significantly lower with prednisone therapy (17 versus 50 percent). Although the relapse rate was lower, prednisone was associated with significantly more adverse effects, including cushingoid changes, weight gain, and hyperlipidemia.</p><p>Based upon the results of this trial, combined with our prior experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], we treat patients with idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (maximum dose 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> for four weeks. If improvement is observed, the dose is then tapered over approximately two to three months to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and maintained for an additional six months.</p><p>Other dosing regimens may be effective, however, with nearly 90 percent of patients responding to glucocorticoids alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/6,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14,15</a>]. The following studies describe alternative strategies for glucocorticoid therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One case series reported use of an initial dose of 60 mg every other day for two months, tapered over the subsequent few months to 5 mg daily and continued for a total duration of therapy of two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Nine of 11 patients who completed this regimen responded with relief of symptoms and regression of the retroperitoneal mass.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, 24 patients were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> for one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The regimen consisted of 60 mg once daily for six weeks, which was usually tapered within the following two to three months to a maintenance dose of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and continued for one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. If severe ureteral obstruction was present, decompression was allowed using nephrostomy tubes or in-dwelling ureteral stents. Twenty-two patients reported significant regression of symptoms, and 19 had a progressive reduction in size of the retroperitoneal mass, as assessed by CT. In addition, 13 patients with initial treatment success showed disease recurrence after steroid withdrawal.</p><p/><p>Some patients with retroperitoneal fibrosis appear to derive greater benefit from glucocorticoid therapy than others. This includes patients in whom the biopsy reveals a substantial inflammatory component and older adults, in whom glucocorticoids may obviate the need for surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/7,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17</a>]. Patients with a positive 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) at the start of treatment are more likely to respond to glucocorticoid therapy than those with a negative FDG-PET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>No laboratory tests are considered to be predictors of response to glucocorticoid therapy. A retrospective study of 37 patients examined whether erythrocyte sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein levels predicted whether <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> therapy would lead to a reduction in retroperitoneal mass size. Although these acute-phase reactant levels tended to be higher in those who showed regression compared with those who did not, this difference was not statistically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H85000568\"><span class=\"h4\">Glucocorticoid-resistant disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Failure to detect clinical or radiologic improvement by four weeks of medical therapy should prompt a repeat evaluation with CT scan and biopsy to ascertain that the diagnosis is correct (eg, not a misdiagnosed infection or lymphoma). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring the response to medical therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>However, some cases of correctly diagnosed idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis may be intrinsically resistant to steroids, possibly because there is more fibrosis than inflammation.</p><p>If the diagnosis is confirmed, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> is usually continued at a high dose (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) for another month, then tapered for two to four additional months. If the disease does not adequately respond to glucocorticoids alone, other agents can be used concurrently to improve the response or to reduce the duration of treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids. Agents that have been tried with apparent success in case reports or case series include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/2,4,20-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,20-25</a>]. There are no published direct comparisons of the effectiveness or the toxicity of various immunosuppressants plus steroids versus steroids alone.</p><p>The efficacy of different immunosuppressive regimens was reported in a retrospective, single-center study of 26 patients with idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. All patients received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (at a dose of 1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for three weeks, which was tapered to zero within six months), as well as ureteral stenting <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a percutaneous nephrostomy. Among 15 patients, prednisone was combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> (at a dose of 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for six months, then 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for another six months). With the remaining 11 patients, prednisone was administered with either oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day for three months, which was then tapered to zero by six months) or intravenous cyclophosphamide (1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per month for six months). At a mean period of follow-up of 49 months, remission, which was defined as stable clinical and radiographic disease, was observed in all patients, except one who died of pneumonia. Seven patients required retreatment.</p><p>As second-line therapy in patients who do not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> alone, we prefer to add <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> due to the favorable responses in other immune-mediated diseases with a chronic clinical course, such as giant cell arteritis or rheumatoid arthritis, in which methotrexate has been extensively used as a steroid-sparing agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Methotrexate is given at a starting dose of 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week,</span> with the dose increased by 2.5 mg increments monthly, until an effect is seen or toxicity limits further increase, to a maximum dose of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span>. Once the methotrexate is started, we decrease the dose of prednisone and taper it to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. The total duration of therapy is based on clinical and radiographic response but is usually at least 8 to 10 months. A review of dosing and monitoring can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Due to the risk of toxicity in those with renal dysfunction, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> should <strong>not</strong> be administered to patients with an eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>.

In a prospective case series, 55 patients with retroperitoneal fibrosis were treated with tamoxifen monotherapy (20 mg twice daily) for two years. The primary endpoint was a composite of three endpoints: subjective clinical improvement by six weeks, stable or decreasing periaortic mass by four months and definite decreasing mass by eight months, and resolution of ureteric obstruction sufficient enough to allow for stent removal. Sixty-five percent of patients met the composite endpoint. Thirty-two percent of those who achieved the composite endpoint relapsed at a median of 26 months following completion of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53159905\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The total duration of therapy depends upon the severity of disease, particularly the extension of the retroperitoneal mass, and also the response to therapy.

Infliximab therapy resulted in a satisfactory clinical and laboratory response, paralleled by an improvement in PET findings. One report has suggested that retroperitoneal fibrosis may occur in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are undergoing anti-TNF-alpha therapy, although the causal link between these agents and the disease is still unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One patient with refractory disease was treated with the anti&ndash;interleukin 6 receptor antibody, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a> (8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> intravenously, once every four weeks for six months), in addition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>.

Failure to detect clinical or radiologic improvement within four weeks of initiation of medical therapy should prompt a repeat evaluation with CT scan and biopsy to ascertain that the diagnosis is correct.</p><p>In addition, an increase in the size of the mass or a new complication related to the mass may prompt surgical intervention. Full resolution of the fibrotic plaque may not occur. However, this is not indicative of treatment failure. In such cases, PET with 18F-FDG may be useful to assess the metabolic activity of the residual retroperitoneal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Following discontinuation of steroids (or other immunosuppressive agents), we suggest monitoring for disease relapse by obtaining a renal ultrasound, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and serum creatinine concentration every three to six months and a CT scan every six months for the first year. Thereafter, we suggest testing every 6 to 12 months, with a CT scan every one to two years.

In most studies, the rate of recurrence following therapy with immunosuppression ranged from less than 10 to 30 percent; one series, however, reported a recurrence rate of over 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/4,15,32,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15,32,42,43</a>]. Different treatment schedules and, above all, different durations of therapy or follow-up may account for the discrepancies in recurrence rates among the studies.

In a prospective, nonrandomized trial, 16 relapsing idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis patients were treated with methotrexate and prednisone for 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Prednisone was given at an initial dose of 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, then tapered over 12 months.

Untreated patients may develop severe complications or progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The goals of therapy are to relieve the obstruction, stop the progression of the fibrotic process, and prevent recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with significant renal dysfunction due to obstruction of the urinary tract by retroperitoneal fibrosis, as with any other cause of obstructive uropathy, we recommend immediate relief of obstruction (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). A variety of surgical interventions are available (open or laparoscopic surgical, percutaneous or endoureteral); open and laparoscopic interventions may be associated with significant risks and complications, whereas percutaneous and endoureteral techniques appear to be safer. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Intervention in patients with urinary tract obstruction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with retroperitoneal fibrosis who have hydronephrosis but no significant impairment in renal function, we suggest initiating a trial of medical therapy without surgical intervention (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If a surgical procedure has been deferred, renal function should be closely followed, and sequential ultrasonography should be performed every two to four weeks to monitor for progression of obstruction. These patients should be referred for surgical decompression of the urinary tract if there is deterioration of kidney function or if there is no improvement or worsening of the hydronephrosis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General approach to therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring the response to interventional therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical therapy of retroperitoneal fibrosis depends upon the cause. Therapy for secondary retroperitoneal fibrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74731\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74731 \">table 1</a>) is aimed at treating the underlying etiology or stopping the offending agent, although some cases of drug-induced disease respond to immunosuppressive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Medical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis, we recommend induction therapy with one month of high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, followed by maintenance therapy with tapering doses of prednisone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). If there is a contraindication to prednisone therapy, we suggest initial therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy with glucocorticoids'</a> above and <a href=\"#H85000331\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy with tamoxifen in patients who cannot take glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Within a few days of beginning glucocorticoid therapy, pain and constitutional symptoms usually improve, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate should fall dramatically. Improvement in urinary tract obstruction indicated by diuresis or by ultrasound may be observed within a few weeks, and resolution of the mass by computed tomography (CT) may begin within a few weeks of initiating medical therapy. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After one month of therapy, we evaluate patients for resolution of symptoms and also perform CT and laboratory studies (including assessments of renal function, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein). If regression of disease is noted at one month, we continue maintenance therapy for another six months. After the first month, we repeat the evaluation every two to three months or more frequently as dictated by symptoms. Following discontinuation of steroids (or other immunosuppressive agents), we monitor for disease relapse by obtaining a renal ultrasound, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and serum creatinine concentration every three to six months and a CT scan every six months for the first year. Thereafter, we evaluate patients every 6 to 12 months and perform a CT scan every one to two years. (See <a href=\"#H53159905\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring the response to medical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis who fail to achieve clinical or radiologic improvement within four to six months of initiating <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> therapy, we suggest adding therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
