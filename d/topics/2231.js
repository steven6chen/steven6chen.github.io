The rate of breastfeeding also decreases with decreasing gestational age, even in infants who are early term (eg, gestational age between 37 and 39 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Early return to work decreases the likelihood of initiating and maintaining breastfeeding. This was illustrated by data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort that showed women who returned to work within six weeks of delivery compared with those who remained home were less likely to initiate breastfeeding (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.08-1.97) and to predominantly breastfeed beyond age three months (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.06-3.80) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>In a Dutch population-based prospective cohort study, breastfeeding rates were greatest in the highest-educated mothers with graduate school education (96 percent) and the lowest in the lowest-educated mothers with less than three years of general secondary school education (73 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. At six months after delivery, the breastfeeding rates were 39 and 15 percent in the highest-educated and lowest-educated mothers, respectively. In China, rates of initiating breastfeeding are similar (80 percent overall), with 21 percent continuing exclusive breastfeeding for at least six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86661908\"><span class=\"h3\">Maintenance of breastfeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early termination of breastfeeding is associated with difficulties in breastfeeding, and maternal perception that breastfeeding is not meeting the needs of their infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support/abstract/18,20-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20-29</a>]. Reasons for early termination within the first month of breastfeeding include sore nipples, perception of inadequate milk supply, and concerns that their infants had difficulty in breastfeeding or were not satisfied. Women who choose formula feeding often lack confidence in their ability to breastfeed because of concerns that their infants prefer formula or they have an inadequate milk supply [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. In addition to mother's lack of confidence to breastfeed, other factors associated with early discontinuation of breastfeeding include return to work and maternal depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support/abstract/26,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,30</a>].</p><p>In United States in 2016, 81 percent of newborn infants started to breastfeed, but breastfeeding did not continue for as long as recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Of infants born that year, 52 percent were breastfeeding at six months, and 31 percent at 12 months. Breastfeeding rates at six months varied among states, ranging from 24 percent in Mississippi to 70 percent in Utah. In a 2007 study, the likelihood of exclusive breastfeeding for six months was decreased in infants with mothers less than 20 years of age, very low birth weight infants (birth weight &lt;1500 g), and those whose mothers reported poor mental or emotional health or living with a stepparent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This study also confirmed that the likelihood of ever being breastfed was lower in non-Hispanic black infants, infants whose mothers did not graduate from high school or were not born in the United States, and in infants who lived with a smoker. </p><p>In a prospective study from Crete of 1049 mothers, of whom 90 percent planned to breastfeed, only 61 percent were breastfeeding one month after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Failure to maintain breastfeeding was most closely associated with lack of breastfeeding previous offspring, maternal cigarette smoking, birth of a premature infant or admission of the infant to the neonatal intensive care unit, low maternal educational achievement, and early maternal reemployment.</p><p>These findings demonstrate that additional support should be directed towards subgroups of women who are less likely to initiate and maintain breastfeeding. Although all of the barriers to breastfeeding, such as a short duration of maternity leave, may not be resolved through education alone, information deficits may contribute to the mother's decision not to breastfeed.</p><p>Individual counseling should focus on the specific issues of the mother that negatively impact breastfeeding. Women may have family members or friends who experienced nipple pain or other problems with breastfeeding. Other common concerns include diet, breast size, nipple shape, personal adjustments, inadequate milk supply, and ability to express milk after returning to work. Parental education and continued support may help alleviate these concerns.

This was best illustrated by a meta-analysis of 38 randomized controlled trials (36 were conducted in developed countries) performed for the United States Preventive Task Force [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Ideally, this support is integrated into both antenatal and postpartum care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], and does not rely upon the motivation of new mothers to contact someone for help [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support/abstract/37,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,40</a>].</p><p>The support should be practical, covering specific areas, rather than a superficial query about whether there are any breastfeeding problems.

Medications should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis for potential contraindications. As reiterated in the 2013 American Academy clinical report, the benefits of breastfeeding for both the infant and mother need to be weighed against the risks of drug exposure to the infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

Infants with this disorder are unable to utilize galactose, a component of the lactose sugar in human milk. Accumulation of galactose leads to adverse consequences, including failure to thrive, liver dysfunction, cataracts, and intellectual disability (mental retardation). Mothers of asymptomatic infants who are positive for galactosemia on the initial screening test should discontinue breastfeeding immediately, but may be advised to pump and store milk until a diagnosis of classical galactosemia is confirmed.

The latter two conditions do not always cause difficulties with nursing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoplastic breast tissue &ndash; Insufficient glandular tissue to support breastfeeding is rare. Hypoplastic breasts may appear tubular or flat and are often widely spaced at the chest wall. Women without sufficient glandular tissue may have no breast enlargement during pregnancy and will produce little or no milk. As a result, their infants are at risk for early failure to thrive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-development-and-morphology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Breast development and morphology&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nipple abnormalities &ndash; Nipple abnormalities may interfere with nursing. Adequate latch-on may be difficult to achieve if the nipple is rigid, inverted, or flat, making it hard to grasp. However, nipple shells, which are sometimes used to draw out inverted nipples, may shorten the duration of breastfeeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Techniques to assist in everting the nipple are generally not recommended during pregnancy because nipple manipulation can induce uterine contractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Prenatal identification results in anticipatory guidance during birth hospitalization by lactation specialists to help mothers with nipple abnormalities achieve an adequate latch. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initiation-of-breastfeeding#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initiation of breastfeeding&quot;, section on 'Inverted nipples'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast surgery &ndash; Breast surgery, such as augmentation or reduction procedures, can interfere with milk production. This is most likely to occur when circular incisions are made around the lateral aspect of the areola, severing ducts, interrupting blood flow, or severing the lateral cutaneous branch of the fourth intercostal nerve. The latter may result in loss of hormonal response to suckling and reduced milk production. Surgical disruption of milk ducts and scar tissue may predispose women to plugged ducts, mastitis, or milk retention cysts formation. However, the effect of surgery on the ability to breastfeed cannot be predicted in advance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Common problems of breastfeeding and weaning&quot;, section on 'Plugged ducts'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of severe malnutrition, poor diet is not a contraindication to breastfeeding, although appropriate nutrition is desirable. Dietary intake during lactation has little impact on the nutrient quality of human milk from well-nourished mothers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-nutrition-during-lactation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal nutrition during lactation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is recommended that breastfeeding women obtain necessary vitamins and minerals from a balanced diet rather than vitamin supplements. An important exception is the potential for low concentrations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyanocobalamin-vitamin-b12-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B12</a> in the milk of strict vegans. Diets of lactating vegans should be reviewed, and vitamin B12 supplements provided, if dietary intake is below recommended levels. In addition, breastfed infants and their mothers are at risk for B12 deficiency following maternal gastric bypass surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In mothers in whom there are concerns that the concentration of other water-soluble vitamins may be borderline, continuation of prenatal vitamins during lactation is a common practice without known detrimental effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Mothers with a history of gastric bypass surgery should be referred to a dietitian familiar with bariatric surgery, pregnancy, and lactation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility and pregnancy after bariatric surgery&quot;, section on 'Micronutrient supplementation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20046904\"><span class=\"h2\">Subsequent pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy is not a contraindication to breastfeeding; however, fluid and caloric intake need to be substantially increased to provide both adequate gestational weight gain and nutrition for the breastfed child. During pregnancy milk supply is reduced slightly and the composition of breast milk changes (increased sodium and protein, decreased potassium, glucose, lactose) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breastfeeding-parental-education-and-support/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Suckling also stimulates uterine contractions. Given the lack of data on the effects of breastfeeding during complicated pregnancies, pregnant women at high risk for preterm delivery or with uteroplacental insufficiency (eg, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction) should probably stop breastfeeding by about 24 weeks of gestation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1545859999\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
