Increased airway responsiveness is also seen in children with recurrent acute wheezing due to causes other than asthma (eg, allergies, viral infections). Asthma and recurrent wheezing are common childhood illnesses; pediatric patients with these conditions commonly present for anesthesia and surgery and can pose challenges for the anesthesiologist. Children with these conditions are at increased risk for perioperative respiratory adverse events, including laryngospasm and bronchospasm.</p><p>Wheezing can occur at any time during anesthesia, most commonly during induction of general anesthesia after endotracheal intubation. If it occurs, it is usually transient and without sequelae if treated. However, bronchospasm can be severe and can result in significant morbidity and mortality.</p><p>This topic will discuss preoperative assessment and preparation of pediatric patients with asthma and recurrent wheezing, as well as intraoperative management. Evaluation and management of asthma in children is discussed in more depth separately.

Any patient with asthma that is not well controlled should be referred to the appropriate clinician, primary care physician, or asthma specialist for treatment optimization prior to elective surgery. Further information about the assessment of asthma control is presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-asthma-management#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of asthma management&quot;, section on 'Symptom assessment'</a>.)</p><p>National and international organizations have developed guidelines that suggest a stepwise approach to the treatment of asthma in children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76669%7EPULM%2F67459\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76669 graphicRef67459 \">figure 1A-B</a>). Patients are placed on a step that prescribes preferred and alternative medications, based on severity and control of symptoms, and can move up or down steps as disease worsens or improves. Medical management typically starts with intermittent use of short-acting beta<sub>2</sub> agonists (SABA), progressing as necessary through the addition of inhaled glucocorticoids in increasing doses, long-acting beta<sub>2</sub> agonists (LABA), leukotriene receptor antagonists, methylxanthines, and oral glucocorticoids.</p><p>Wheezing is a known risk factor for PRAE. In a large cohort study of 9287 children undergoing general anesthesia, perioperative bronchospasm and laryngospasm were encountered in 2.1 and 3.8 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-asthma-or-recurrent-wheezing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A positive respiratory history (URI in the last two weeks, nocturnal dry cough, wheezing during exercise, or wheezing more than three times in the past 12 months) was associated with an increased risk of bronchospasm, perioperative cough, desaturation, or airway obstruction. URI was associated with PRAE only if present at the time of anesthesia or less than two weeks prior to the procedure. A history of current or past eczema as well as a family history of two family members with asthma, eczema, hayfever, or smoking increased the risk of PRAE as well. Risk factors for PRAE are shown in table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F99883\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99883 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1410380150\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative physical examination for asthmatics should focus on respiratory rate, wheezing, signs of lung infection, and air movement. The patient should ideally not be wheezing at the time of anesthesia.

Spirometry and measurement of peak flow rate can be used in the office setting for older children and may be useful preoperatively if the degree of asthma control is in question.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laboratory testing </strong>&ndash; Preoperative blood tests are rarely required and should only be performed as they would be for patients without asthma. However, patients who have taken oral glucocorticoids may be at risk for suppression of the hypothalamic pituitary axis (HPA) and adrenal insufficiency with the stress of surgery. Children who have been taking more than 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> for more than three weeks in the past year should either have the hypothalamic pituitary axis evaluated or, more commonly, should receive stress dose steroids prior to induction of anesthesia. HPA suppression in patients taking glucocorticoids and stress dose glucocorticoids are discussed in more detail separately.

In addition, a number of studies have shown that systemic glucocorticoids do not increase postoperative wound infections, delayed wound healing, or asthma exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-asthma-or-recurrent-wheezing/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. However, there are no specific pediatric data.

We prefer to use distraction techniques (eg, toys, video games, stickers) prior to anesthesia for most pediatric patients, including those with asthma, rather than administration of sedatives.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Alpha agonists</strong> &ndash; There are conflicting data regarding the use of alpha agonists, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clonidine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexmedetomidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexmedetomidine</a>, for patients with asthma. Alpha agonists have been shown in animal studies to blunt reflex bronchoconstriction and might therefore be beneficial as premedication for children undergoing general anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-asthma-or-recurrent-wheezing/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In contrast, two small clinical trials in adults showed an increase in histamine-induced airway resistance following oral clonidine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-asthma-or-recurrent-wheezing/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

When possible, avoidance of endotracheal intubation and instead the use of noninvasive airway devices (eg, supraglottic airway devices) decrease the chance of intraoperative bronchospasm and laryngospasm.</p><p>While regional anesthesia avoids the need to manipulate the airway, it is rarely used in the pediatric population. When possible in older children, regional anesthesia is a good choice as it avoids the need to manipulate the airway. Regional anesthesia is discussed more fully separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-adult-patients-with-asthma#H1234674329\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for adult patients with asthma&quot;, section on 'Regional anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p>General anesthesia is associated with increased risk of bronchospasm and laryngospasm compared with regional anesthesia. In this setting bronchospasm occurs most commonly because of mechanical stimulation of the airway. In addition, bronchospasm can result from histamine release, an allergic reaction to administered medication, or from vagal stimulation during surgery (eg, peritoneal insufflation during laparoscopy, manipulation of viscera, or endoscopy).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1269448\"><span class=\"h1\">STRATEGY FOR GENERAL ANESTHESIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of perioperative respiratory adverse events (PRAE), particularly for bronchospasm and laryngospasm, decreases with increasing experience in pediatric airway management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-asthma-or-recurrent-wheezing/abstract/1,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15,16</a>]. As such, we suggest that asthmatic children are best managed by an experienced pediatric anesthesiologist. This is particularly true for those with additional risk factors for PRAE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F99883\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99883 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26418860\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One goal of induction of anesthesia in the asthmatic patient is to minimize the risk of a bronchoconstrictive response to airway management. Since the risk of bronchospasm is lower with a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) or mask ventilation when compared with endotracheal intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-asthma-or-recurrent-wheezing/abstract/1,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17-19</a>], these less invasive devices should be used when possible rather than an endotracheal tube.</p><p>If endotracheal intubation is planned, we suggest the use of a cuffed endotracheal tube (ETT) as opposed to an uncuffed ETT for all children, but particularly if a child has an increased risk of developing bronchospasm or has poorly controlled asthma. The cuffed ETT allows the use of higher peak airway pressures during mechanical ventilation with less leakage around the ETT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-asthma-or-recurrent-wheezing/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. A further advantage, irrespective of the presence of asthma, is that cuffed ETTs (when cuff pressure is well monitored) are associated with less postoperative sore throat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-asthma-or-recurrent-wheezing/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. If endotracheal intubation is planned, we recommend the use of neuromuscular blocking agents for children with asthma, as this is associated with less PRAE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-the-child-with-asthma-or-recurrent-wheezing/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1269455\"><span class=\"h2\">Induction of anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Induction must achieve a depth of anesthesia sufficient to prevent physiologic response to airway manipulation. This is particularly important in the patient with asthma.</p><p>Most intravenous (IV) and inhalational anesthesia induction agents blunt airway reflexes and produce bronchodilation in varying degrees. During induction of anesthesia and airway manipulation, the ability of a medication to suppress airway reflexes is of particular value.
