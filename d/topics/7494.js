Age of onset is typically in the late 50s or early 60s. The primary initial clinical manifestations include changes in personality and social behavior or language, progressing over time to a more global dementia affecting cognitive domains as well. A subset of patients may also exhibit symptoms of extrapyramidal or motor neuron involvement at some point in the disease process.</p><p>There are no currently FDA-approved disease modifying treatments for the treatment of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Since the underlying pathology of FTD most often consists of abnormal tau or TDP-43 protein aggregates, treatments geared toward beta-amyloid reduction that appear promising in Alzheimer disease (AD) are not expected to be effective for FTD.</p><p>Symptomatic relief can be provided by a variety of agents; these medications should be considered in conjunction with non-pharmacologic interventions, such as thoughtful evaluation of the patient's living environment.</p><p>This topic discusses treatment issues specific to patients with FTD. Epidemiology, pathology, clinical features and diagnosis of FTD, and the management of other forms of dementia are discussed separately.

However, despite the fact that they are commonly used, there is limited evidence of the efficacy of pharmacologic treatments in FTD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9729255\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurotransmitter systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A neurochemical basis for FTD remains to be fully elucidated. Nonetheless, studies have indicated problems in certain neurotransmitter systems:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormalities in serotonin activity have been demonstrated in autopsy, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid studies in patients with FTD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In addition, serotonergic dysfunction has been linked to many of the behavioral problems that are common in FTD; however, these associations have been made, for the most part, in nondemented patients rather than in FTD patient populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dopaminergic function can also be altered in patients with FTD, usually in proportion to the severity of extrapyramidal motor symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. However, one study found that increased activity of dopaminergic neurotransmission and altered serotonergic modulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission was specifically associated with agitated and aggressive behavior, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cholinergic system appears to be relatively preserved in FTD, in contrast to Alzheimer disease (AD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/3,4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,7</a>].</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9729262\"><span class=\"h2\">Behavioral changes</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9729270\"><span class=\"h3\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Behavioral symptoms can be quite varied ranging from apathy and inertia to agitation with aggression; there may be socially inappropriate behavior and compulsions that can manifest as hoarding or abnormal eating behaviors.

These can be quite challenging to treat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>When neurobehavioral problems appear or worsen, clinicians should consider the possibility of delirium, pain or discomfort as a cause for their symptoms before initiating treatment.

Starting with the lowest available dose of medication, slow upward dose titration, and frequent monitoring for side effects are recommended.</p><p>Because it is common to see medications make behaviors worse, slow movement and reaction times, and cause deterioration in cognition, it is reasonable to continuously reevaluate the role of the medications and consider tapering medications in patients with FTD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9729311\"><span class=\"h3\">Serotonergic medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evidence supporting the use of serotonergic medications is stronger than for other classes of medications; however, this evidence comes mostly from uncontrolled observations rather than from controlled clinical trials.</p><p>Serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvoxamine</a>) have been reported to decrease disinhibition, anxiety, impulsivity, repetitive behaviors, and eating disorders in case reports and small observational studies of patients with FTD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/5,13-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13-19</a>]. Individual patients with sexual disinhibition have been treated with SSRIs with success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/14,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,20</a>]. In a case series of four patients, pathologic stealing behavior was not attenuated with SSRI therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>An unblinded, randomized trial of 16 patients compared the SSRI <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> (up to 20 mg per day) and piracetam (up to 1200 mg per day). At 14 months, treatment with paroxetine was associated with significant improvement in behavioral symptoms and decreased caregiver stress compared with piracetam-treated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In contrast, another double-blinded randomized, cross-over trial in 10 patients found that six weeks of paroxetine, rapidly escalated to a dose of 40 mg per day, was not associated with improvements in behavioral or executive function outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Low doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trazodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trazodone</a>, an atypical serotonergic antidepressant agent, have been reported to be effective in treating agitation and aggression in patients with FTD in observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A double-blinded, randomized, cross-over trial of trazodone in 26 patients with FTD, found a significant reduction in neuropsychiatric symptoms with trazodone as compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

In one case series, 17 patients with FTD were treated with olanzapine (2.5 to 10 mg per day) and followed for 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Treatment was associated with a decrease in delusions and other neurobehavioral symptoms as well as reduced caregiver stress. Somnolence was observed in almost a third, but could be managed by dose reductions.</p><p>Patients with FTD are particularly vulnerable to the extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics. These medications should be used with great caution; depot preparations, typical antipsychotic agents, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a> should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Because of these adverse effects, antipsychotic medications should be considered a last resort only after trying behavioral modifications and SSRIs. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Quetiapine</a> has moderate D2 receptor antagonism relative to other antipsychotic medications and thus may cause fewer extrapyramidal side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Patients and family members should be informed that use of antipsychotic medications has been associated with increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia.

Methylphenidate increases synaptic levels of dopamine and norepinephrine. Apathy, in particular, is a neurobehavioral symptom, common in FTD that might be expected to respond to stimulant medication.</p><p>The clinical evidence supporting the benefit of these agents is very limited. A case report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>] and a small case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] reported behavioral improvements in apathy and disinhibition with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextroamphetamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dextroamphetamine</a>, respectively.

Physical aids such as a raised toilet seat, commodes, and removal of unsecured rugs can help reduce the potential for injuries in the home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1822765\"><span class=\"h2\">Speech therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Speech therapy and the use of communication aids may provide benefit early on in patients with semantic dementia or progressive nonfluent aphasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Later in the course of the illness, evaluation of swallowing is important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1822771\"><span class=\"h2\">Behavioral modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonpharmacologic behavioral modification techniques can be a useful adjunct in the management of the problematic behaviors in FTD. A behavioral monitoring log may help identify triggers that can be avoided or otherwise managed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Distraction, redirection, and offering of simple choices can be effective alternatives to medications for compulsive behaviors, agitation, and anxiety, but require caregiver education. A structured environment that avoids overstimulation can provide stability and predictability for the patient. Providing environmental cues for behaviors that should be encouraged (eg, laying out clothing, tools for self care) and removing environmental cues for behaviors that wish to discourage (eg, car keys) can also be useful in some patients.</p><p>Caregiver stress is a significant problem in FTD. Respite care and support groups are available in most areas, often through the local agency on aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia&quot;, section on 'Support for caregivers'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9729485\"><span class=\"h1\">FUTURE APPROACHES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disease-modifying approaches to the treatment of FTD and related disorders are underway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. With the recent advent of promising animal and human data with tau-modifying compounds such as davunetide and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>, new studies targeting FTD patients with suspected tau-pathology are under way. Similarly, medications that boost progranulin in cell culture and in animal models are being developed for this genetic form of FTD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H712260\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FTD appears to progress more rapidly than Alzheimer disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. Survival from symptom onset is approximately eight to ten years and is often shorter in patients with the behavioral variant of FTD (bvFTD) than those with primary progressive aphasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/58-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-64</a>]. Patients with bvFTD with motor neuron disease have the shortest disease duration of approximately two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/55,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H712279\"><span class=\"h1\">PALLIATIVE CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the terminal stages of dementia, patients and their caregivers are faced with a range of physical and psychosocial needs, and effective palliative care can improve patients&rsquo; symptoms, lessen caregiver burden, and help ensure that treatment decisions are well informed and weighed in the context of patient and family goals and needs. Aspects of palliative care that are specific to patients with advanced dementia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-of-patients-with-advanced-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care of patients with advanced dementia&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9729492\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are currently no effective disease modifying treatments for the treatment of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions are aimed at ameliorating symptoms, particularly the behavioral symptoms of FTD.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When neurobehavioral problems appear or worsen, clinicians should consider the possibility of delirium, pain, or discomfort as a cause for these symptoms before initiating pharmacological treatment. (See <a href=\"#H9729270\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with FTD are susceptible to adverse effects of medications including paradoxical behavioral reactions, extrapyramidal side effects, confusion, and sedation. Starting with the lowest available dose of medication, slow upward dose titration, and frequent monitoring for side effects are recommended. Medications should be regularly reevaluated and consideration made for drug withdrawal. (See <a href=\"#H9729270\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest a treatment trial of a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> 10 mg once or twice daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trazodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trazodone</a> (25 mg once daily) for patients with troubling neurobehavioral symptoms of FTD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9729311\" class=\"local\">'Serotonergic medications'</a> above.)<br/><br/>Other treatment options include atypical antipsychotic agents to be used as a last resort. Patients with FTD need to be carefully monitored for extrapyramidal side effects for which they are particularly vulnerable. Because of this, we use a low dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a> (12.5 to 25 mg), with less reported extrapyramidal side effects relative to other antipsychotic medications. Families should be warned about the increased mortality associated with use of these medications in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H9729318\" class=\"local\">'Antipsychotic medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholinesterase inhibitors do not have convincing evidence of benefit in patients with FTD. However, a treatment trial is not unreasonable when there is uncertainty as to the underlying diagnosis (Alzheimer disease versus FTD). (See <a href=\"#H9729354\" class=\"local\">'Cholinesterase inhibitors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9729404\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonpharmacologic interventions are an important facet of the management of patients with FTD and can include an exercise program, modification of the home environment, increased supervision, physical, occupational, and speech therapy, behavioral modification techniques, and caregiver support and respite. (See <a href=\"#H9729442\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frontotemporal-dementia-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Clinical and neuropathological criteria for frontotemporal dementia.
