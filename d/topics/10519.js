DLE most commonly occurs on the head and is characterized by well-defined inflammatory plaques that evolve into atrophic, disfiguring scars (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F64844%7EDERM%2F75833\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64844 graphicRef75833 \">picture 1A-B</a>). SCLE typically presents with erythematous, scaly papules or annular plaques on the neck, upper trunk, and arms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F66580%7EDERM%2F55903\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66580 graphicRef55903 \">picture 2A-B</a>). The symptomatic and disfiguring nature of DLE and SCLE underlies the need for appropriate treatment. </p><p>Most patients with DLE or SCLE will respond to conservative therapy with topical agents and antimalarial drugs; however, when the response to these interventions is inadequate, alternative immunomodulating or immunosuppressive drugs must be utilized. The management of patients with refractory DLE and SCLE will be discussed here; the initial management of these disorders and the clinical manifestations of DLE and SCLE are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of discoid lupus and subacute cutaneous lupus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-lupus-erythematosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous lupus erythematosus&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1087099\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO REFRACTORY DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients with cutaneous LE, strict photoprotection combined with topical or intralesional corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, or systemic antimalarial agents results in satisfactory improvement. When disease is refractory to these interventions, other systemic agents are utilized. The adverse effects of many of these drugs limit their use to the subset of patients who fail to respond to conventional therapy.</p><p>Data on the efficacy of treatments for refractory DLE and SCLE primarily are limited to small open-label studies, retrospective reviews, case series, and case reports. The scarcity of high quality studies stems from a lack of pharmaceutical, governmental, and foundational support for large, multicenter, controlled trials in cutaneous LE, as well as the relative rarity of refractory cutaneous LE.</p><p>In addition, the historical absence of standardized objective measures of disease activity in cutaneous LE has made it difficult to systematically interpret the results of much of the published literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In 2005, the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) was developed and validated as a tool to assess disease activity and skin damage in cutaneous LE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The CLASI is now being used in a number of clinical trials, and should improve the quality and applicability of data from studies of cutaneous LE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A revised version of CLASI has also been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32666738\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with DLE or SCLE who have failed topical, intralesional, and antimalarial therapy can be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, systemic retinoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Among these agents, methotrexate and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a> have the strongest evidence for efficacy for treatment of DLE and SCLE. In general, we favor methotrexate based upon the data supporting the use of this agent, as well as reports of patients in whom periods of disease remission occurred following the discontinuation of methotrexate therapy. Systemic retinoids (acitretin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a>) are much more expensive than methotrexate, and in our experience, relapses occur quickly following discontinuation of these drugs. (See <a href=\"#H32666692\" class=\"local\">'First-line agents'</a> below.) </p><p>The ability of patients to tolerate treatments also influences the selection of the most appropriate medication. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a> can cause serious toxicity in patients with renal insufficiency or preexisting liver disease. Although methotrexate, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (MMF), and systemic retinoids are all teratogenic, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a> is an unfavorable choice for women of child-bearing potential due to the long period during which women must abstain from pregnancy following treatment with the drug (three years). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dapsone</a> cannot be given to patients with sulfonamide allergies and must be used with caution in patients with G6PD deficiency.</p><p>When one or more of the above agents is unsuccessful, more aggressive therapy to induce disease remission should be considered. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Thalidomide</a> is highly effective for cutaneous LE, but it is the potential for serious adverse effects, including teratogenicity and a relatively high risk of peripheral neuropathy, that keeps thalidomide from being used as a first line agent for refractory cutaneous LE. Thalidomide should only be used in patients who comprehend the risks associated with this drug. Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) has also been effective as a remission-inducing agent, particularly for SCLE. Improvement following IVIG generally is short-lived, and treatment with IVIG is expensive. (See <a href=\"#H1088110\" class=\"local\">'Remission-inducing agents'</a> below.)</p><p>A number of other treatments, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, and other immunomodulatory agents, have also been used in refractory DLE and SCLE. However, the evidence for the efficacy of these drugs is limited and the range of adverse effects is wide, delegating the use of these agents to patients who fail to respond to the other therapies for refractory disease. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clofazimine-united-states-available-via-national-hansens-disease-program-and-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clofazimine</a> has also been used for the treatment of refractory cutaneous LE, but the availability of this drug is limited.

Proposed mechanisms for the therapeutic properties of methotrexate in connective tissue diseases include anti-inflammatory effects secondary to increased production of adenosine, inhibitory action on lymphocytes and neutrophils, and suppression of antibody production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1087166\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy and administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> was beneficial for cutaneous LE in a six-month randomized trial in which 37 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus were treated with either methotrexate (15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week)</span> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Compared with the patients who were given placebo, those who took methotrexate were less likely to have signs of active cutaneous LE (malar rash or DLE) at the end of the trial. The percentage of patients with cutaneous LE decreased from 60 to 16 percent in the group treated with methotrexate, but increased from 76 to 84 percent in the placebo group. The authors did not distinguish between the response rates in patients with malar rash versus DLE. </p><p>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> specifically for refractory DLE and SCLE is supported by the results of retrospective studies and case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/9,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13-16</a>]. In one retrospective study, 43 patients with cutaneous LE that was refractory to other systemic agents (including 16 subjects with SCLE and 12 subjects with DLE) were treated with 7.5 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span> of oral or intravenous methotrexate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-refractory-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].
