The optimal management of patients with a low detectable serum PSA that remains stable is controversial. Given the uncertainty about the meaning of these low levels of PSA, our approach is to monitor these patients without specific therapy.</p><p>The natural history of patients with a persistently elevated PSA is illustrated by two large series:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective series of 566 men who had undergone radical prostatectomy found that 419 (74 percent) had an undetectable PSA (ie, &le;0.03 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> following surgery, 93 (16 percent) had a detectable PSA that remained stable but &lt;0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> and 54 (10 percent) had a detectable PSA that was unstable (two subsequent increases in serum PSA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a PSA velocity of &ge;0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/year)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-or-persistently-elevated-serum-psa-following-radical-prostatectomy-for-prostate-cancer-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

In contrast, a short (eg, &lt;6 months) PSA doubling time, Gleason score &ge;8, a history of lymph node or seminal vesicle involvement at original diagnosis, and persistent elevation of PSA following RT were all associated with poorer bRFS in those managed with salvage RT.</p><p>Although these studies have been used to define patients who are more likely to benefit from salvage RT, these analyses were retrospective and did not include a control group that was managed with observation rather than active intervention. Thus, the factors identified in these studies may have been prognostic for the development of a biochemical relapse and not predictive of improved cancer-specific survival in response to treatment with salvage RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-or-persistently-elevated-serum-psa-following-radical-prostatectomy-for-prostate-cancer-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Three, large, retrospective, single-institution series provide conflicting data on whether or not salvage RT as a single modality can prolong survival:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 2657 men treated at the Mayo Clinic who had a biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy, 856 (32 percent) received salvage RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-or-persistently-elevated-serum-psa-following-radical-prostatectomy-for-prostate-cancer-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. On multivariate analysis, salvage RT significantly reduced the incidence of a subsequent local recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 0.13, 95% CI 0.06-0.28). However, salvage RT did not significantly decrease mortality compared with those not receiving salvage RT following a biochemical recurrence (5- and 10-year survival rates 92 versus 91 and 70 versus 69 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study from Johns Hopkins analyzed 635 patients who had either a biochemical or a local recurrence following radical prostatectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-or-persistently-elevated-serum-psa-following-radical-prostatectomy-for-prostate-cancer-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. At recurrence, patients were managed with observation, salvage RT alone, or salvage RT in combination with hormonal therapy in 63, 25, and 12 percent of cases, respectively.

At a median follow-up of 11 years, multivariate analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in all-cause mortality both in those with a PSA doubling time &lt;6 months and in those with a PSA doubling time &ge;6 months (adjusted HR 0.53 and 0.52, respectively).</p><p/><p>Prompt initiation of salvage RT in appropriate candidates once a PSA relapse has been documented appears to be more effective when the serum PSA is lower (ie, &lt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> compared with salvage therapy once the serum PSA is &gt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-or-persistently-elevated-serum-psa-following-radical-prostatectomy-for-prostate-cancer-management/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

With a median follow-up of four years, the five-year bRFS was 73 percent. On multivariate analysis, factors associated with a better outcome following salvage RT included pathologic stage (T2 versus T3), negative versus positive surgical margins, Gleason 6 versus Gleason 7 or 8 disease, and lower pre-RT serum PSA.

Men were randomly assigned to salvage RT with a six-month course of ADT (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=goserelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">goserelin</a>) or to salvage RT alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-or-persistently-elevated-serum-psa-following-radical-prostatectomy-for-prostate-cancer-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. At a median follow-up of 63 months, the addition of ADT significantly prolonged five-year progression-free survival compared with RT alone (80 versus 62 percent, HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.38-0.66), but it did not significantly improve five-year overall survival (96 versus 95 percent, HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.4-1.2). Longer-term survival data (10 years) are awaited.</p><p>The RTOG 9601 trial included 760 men with a detectable PSA (0.2 to 4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> following radical prostatectomy and randomly assigned them to RT plus placebo or RT with antiandrogen therapy for 24 months (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=bicalutamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bicalutamide</a> 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rising-or-persistently-elevated-serum-psa-following-radical-prostatectomy-for-prostate-cancer-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The median follow-up at the time of the report was 13 years. Overall survival at 12 years was 76 percent in the bicalutamide group and 71 percent in the placebo group (HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.59-0.99). Prostate cancer mortality at 12 years was reduced from 13.4 percent in the placebo group to 5.8 percent in the bicalutamide group (p &lt;0.001). Gynecomastia was more common in the bicalutamide group compared with the placebo group (70 versus 11 percent). There was strong evidence of heterogeneity, and the beneficial effect of bicalutamide was most evident in patients with a pre-RT PSA of &ge;0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. Interpretation of the trial is difficult since the patient population included both patients with a residual elevation of serum PSA following radical prostatectomy and those with a PSA that subsequently rose. Furthermore, the trial used a dose of bicalutamide of 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> which is more than the approved dose in the United States and may account for the difference in the incidence of gynecomastia.</p><p>Based on these results, our approach outside of a clinical trial setting is to use ADT in conjunction with RT in men with unfavorable risk factors at the time of radical prostatectomy (Gleason score &ge;8, preoperative PSA &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> seminal vesicle invasion, low-volume metastases to regional lymph node) or unfavorable features following radical prostatectomy (high-grade disease or a pretreatment PSA above 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span>.

For men in whom a PSA recurrence has been documented and who are candidates for salvage therapy, such treatment should be initiated promptly. Although there are no randomized trials that address this topic, this approach is well tolerated and appears to extend cancer-specific survival compared with management with observation alone. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic factors and impact on survival'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4246508254\" class=\"local\">'Timing of salvage RT'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For men receiving salvage radiation therapy (RT), we recommend a minimum RT dose of at least 66 Gy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Based upon historical series that suggest that higher doses may be beneficial, our practice is to use a total dose of at least 66 Gy while minimizing toxicity. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Dose of radiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The optimal treatment volume is controversial. We suggest that outside of a clinical trial setting, RT be limited to the prostate bed and not include the pelvic lymph nodes (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). RTOG 0534 is currently assessing whether there is an additional benefit from more extensive RT fields, and patients should be enrolled on protocol whenever possible.
