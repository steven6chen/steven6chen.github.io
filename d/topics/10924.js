It happens when there is inflammation in the metatarsals, which are the foot bones closest to the toes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83480\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83480 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Different things can cause metatarsalgia. It can happen in people who run or do other activities that put a lot of pressure on the feet. It can also happen in people who wear tight-fitting shoes a lot or have certain foot problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H275288241\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of metatarsalgia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metatarsalgia causes pain in the ball of the foot. The pain can also spread to the toes. The pain is usually worse when people run or do other activities that put pressure on their feet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H275288256\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have metatarsalgia by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam. He or she might order an X-ray of your foot to make sure your symptoms are not caused by another condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H275288271\"><span class=\"h1\">How is metatarsalgia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for metatarsalgia usually involves one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resting your foot &ndash; Give your foot a chance to heal by resting. But don't completely stop being active. You can do activities that put less pressure on your feet, such as swimming.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Putting ice on your foot when it hurts or after activities that cause pain &ndash; You can put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the painful area every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. Put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking a pain-relieving medicine, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing sturdy shoes and a metatarsal insert &ndash; Sneakers with a lot of cushion and good arch and heel support are best. Your doctor will also probably recommend that you put a padded insert called a &quot;metatarsal pad&quot; into your shoe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing arch supports or special shoe inserts called &quot;orthotics&quot; that are made to fit your foot.</p><p/><p>In most cases, these treatments help improve symptoms. But if your symptoms don't improve, your doctor might talk with you about other options. This might involve surgery to correct the position of your foot bones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H275288286\"><span class=\"h1\">How long does metatarsalgia take to heal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metatarsalgia can take weeks to months to heal, depending on the cause and your symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H275288301\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bunion-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bunion (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Exercise (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heel-pain-caused-by-plantar-fasciitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heel pain (caused by plantar fasciitis) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heel-pain-caused-by-plantar-fasciitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heel pain (caused by plantar fasciitis) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
