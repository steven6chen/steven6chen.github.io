The lung infection is often caused by bacteria, but it can also be caused by viruses or other germs.</p><p>Doctors use the term &quot;community-acquired&quot; when a person catches an infection in their daily life, and not from being in the hospital. Doctors call it &quot;hospital-acquired&quot; when people catch an infection from being in the hospital.</p><p>Community-acquired pneumonia can be mild or severe. A mild infection is sometimes called &quot;walking pneumonia.&quot; That's because most people with walking pneumonia are not very sick and can still walk around and do their daily activities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10513248\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of community-acquired pneumonia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough &ndash; People sometimes cough up mucus (sputum).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain, especially when taking a deep breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fast heartbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shaking chills</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10513263\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have the symptoms listed above, see a doctor or nurse as soon as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10513278\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she will probably do a chest X-ray to look for an infection in your lungs.</p><p>Depending on your individual situation, you might need other tests. These can include blood tests or lab tests on a sample of mucus that you cough up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10513293\"><span class=\"h1\">How is community-acquired pneumonia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors treat community-acquired pneumonia with antibiotic medicines. These medicines kill the germs that are causing the infection. Most people can take antibiotic pills at home, but some people need to be treated in the hospital. People who are treated in the hospital usually get antibiotics through a thin tube that goes into their vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot;</p><p>Some people also get extra oxygen to help them breathe more easily.</p><p>Most people start to feel better within 3 to 5 days of taking their medicine. But a cough from pneumonia can last weeks or months after treatment. If your symptoms do not improve or get worse after starting treatment, tell your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10513308\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything else I can do to take care of myself?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get plenty of rest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink plenty of fluids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a fever-reducing medicine, if you have a fever</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10513323\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to keep from getting pneumonia again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To avoid germs, you can wash your hands often with soap and water, or use alcohol hand rubs.</p><p>You can also get certain vaccines to help keep you from getting pneumonia again. Vaccines can prevent certain serious or deadly infections. You should get the flu vaccine every year. Depending on your individual situation, your doctor might also recommend that you get the pneumococcal vaccine. This can help keep you from getting an infection from the kind of bacteria that most commonly causes pneumonia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10513338\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hospital-acquired-pneumonia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hospital-acquired pneumonia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shortness-of-breath-dyspnea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Shortness of breath (dyspnea) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Flu (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flu-vaccine-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Flu vaccine (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumonia in children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-prevention-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pneumonia prevention in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
