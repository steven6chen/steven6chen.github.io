While <span class=\"nowrap\">pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas</span> share overlapping characteristics that span histopathology, epidemiology, and even molecular pathobiology, they also have many differences in terms of their clinical behavior, aggressiveness and metastatic potential, biochemical findings, and association with inherited genetic syndromes.</p><p><br/>Most <span class=\"nowrap\">pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas</span> are benign. At least 10 percent of pheochromocytomas are malignant (as defined by the presence of metastases), while a larger proportion of paragangliomas (up to 25 percent) are malignant.

As a result, biochemical testing is indicated in every patient with a paraganglioma even if he or she does not present with a clinical picture of catecholamine hypersecretion.

Several susceptibility genes have been established as playing a central role in the pathogenesis of both pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraganglioma-and-pheochromocytoma-management-of-malignant-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some of these represent inherited conditions (mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau [<em>VHL</em>] tumor suppressor gene, the rearranged during transfection [<em>RET</em>] proto-oncogene, the neurofibromatosis type 1 [<em>NF1</em>] tumor suppressor gene, genes encoding for the four subunits [A, B, C, and D] of the succinate dehydrogenase [<em>SDH</em>] complex, and a gene encoding the enzyme responsible for flavination of the SDHA subunit [<em>SDHAF2</em>]), while others are somatic mutations that have not been demonstrated to be linked to an inherited syndrome (mutations in the genes <em>TMEM127</em> and <em>MAX</em>, and <em>HIF2A</em>).</p><p>Since 1990, close to 20 different <span class=\"nowrap\">pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma</span> susceptibility genes have been reported (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F106549\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106549 \">table 1</a>). Mutations contributing to pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma have two general transcription signatures: cluster 1, genes encoding proteins that function in the cellular response to hypoxia; and cluster 2, gene-encoding proteins that activate kinase signaling. Cluster 1 tumors are mostly extra-adrenal paragangliomas (except in <em>VHL</em> where most tumors are localized to the adrenal) and nearly all have a noradrenergic biochemical phenotype, whereas cluster 2 tumors are usually adrenal pheochromocytomas with an adrenergic biochemical phenotype. Cluster 1 germline mutations include: <em>NF1</em>,<em> RET</em>,<em> VHL</em>,<em> SDHD</em>,<em> SDHC</em>,<em> SDHB</em>,<em> SDHAF2</em>,<em> SDHA EGLN1 (PHD2)</em>,<em> KIF1</em>,<em> SDHAF2</em>,<em> IDH1</em>,<em> TMEM127</em>,<em> SDHA</em>,<em> VHL, MAX</em>,<em> HIF2</em>, <em>FH</em> gene encoding fumarate hydratase, <em>EGLN1 (PHD2)</em>, <em>EGLN2 (PHD1)</em>, and <em>KIF1B</em>. Cluster 2 germline mutations include: <em>RET</em>, <em>NF1</em>, <em>MAX</em>, and <em>TMEM127</em>. Genetic studies suggest that other genes may be involved in the pathogenesis of these tumors and investigations are underway to uncover novel mutations in apparently &quot;sporadic&quot; cases.

Given that there is no combination of clinical, histopathologic, or biochemical features shown to reliably predict biologic behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraganglioma-and-pheochromocytoma-management-of-malignant-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>], pathologic evaluations generally provide little prognostic insight to predict risk of recurrence or metastases. A diagnosis of malignancy can only be made by identifying tumor deposits in tissues that do not normally contain chromaffin cells (eg, lymph nodes, liver, bone, lung, and other distant metastatic sites). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paragangliomas-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology#H3767941\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paragangliomas: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and histology&quot;, section on 'Histology and malignant potential'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma,</span> long-term surveillance should be conducted to assess for malignancy.

In the skull base and neck, malignancy is least common for jugulotympanic tumors (2 to 4 percent), slightly higher for carotid body tumors (4 to 6 percent), and highest for vagal tumors (10 to 19 percent).

These data have led some to recommend selective lymph node dissection at the time of primary resection. Although outcomes of patients with regional nodal disease are better than those with distant metastases (five-year survival 77 versus 12 percent in the above noted series from the National Cancer Database [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraganglioma-and-pheochromocytoma-management-of-malignant-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]), adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) is frequently recommended.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paragangliomas-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-histology#H15698737\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paragangliomas: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and histology&quot;, section on 'Overview'</a>.)</p><p>While the presence of distant metastatic disease can have an adverse effect on prognosis, metastases do not necessarily represent a contraindication to local intervention. Interventions such as surgical debulking, ablation, or stereotactic RT represent effective options for primary management of recurrent or metastatic disease. Even if surgical intervention does not result in complete debulking, it may still be considered with palliative intent to release tumor pressure on surrounding tissues or to decrease tumor mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraganglioma-and-pheochromocytoma-management-of-malignant-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A lower tumor burden can lead to a significant decrease in catecholamine secretion (for functioning tumors) as well as lowered dosage of agents used for adrenergic blockade. It can also improve the response to other therapeutic approaches. However, a survival advantage for surgical debulking has not been shown (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paragangliomas-treatment-of-locoregional-disease#H7781944\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paragangliomas: Treatment of locoregional disease&quot;, section on 'Medical preparation for surgery'</a>). For patients not amenable to surgery or for those that require additional postoperative therapy, a number of palliative options are available, including 131-iodine-labeled meta-iodobenzylguanidine (<sup>131</sup>I-MIBG) therapy, chemotherapy, RT, cryoablation therapy, radiofrequency ablation therapy, ethanol injection, tumor embolization, and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5767757\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical course of metastatic <span class=\"nowrap\">pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma</span> is highly variable, with reported five-year survival rates that range widely from 12 to 84 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraganglioma-and-pheochromocytoma-management-of-malignant-disease/abstract/5,7-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7-17</a>]. Some of this variability has to do with differing definitions of malignancy; the World Health Organization (WHO) considers that malignant <span class=\"nowrap\">pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas</span> are only those with documented metastases to nodes or distantly, whereas the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology Fascicle for Tumors of the Adrenal Glands and Extra-Adrenal Paraganglia defines malignancy as &quot;extensive local invasion or documentation of metastases.&quot; For the purpose of this review, we consider that malignant <span class=\"nowrap\">pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma</span> requires the documentation of metastatic disease.

Paragangliomas can arise in the skull base and neck (where the majority are nonsecretory), or below the neck in the thorax or abdomen (where the majority are secretory) (see <a href=\"#H94109321\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma,</span> long-term surveillance should be conducted to assess for malignancy.

Approximately 10 percent of pheochromocytomas are malignant (as defined by the presence of metastases) compared with 20 to 25 percent of extra-adrenal abdominal and mediastinal secretory paragangliomas. In the skull base and neck, malignancy is least common for jugulotympanic tumors (2 to 4 percent), slightly higher for carotid body tumors (4 to 6 percent), and highest for vagal tumors (10 to 19 percent).<br/><br/>Among patients with malignant skull base and neck paragangliomas, metastases are most frequently limited to the regional lymph nodes. In contrast, patients with paragangliomas below the skull base and neck most frequently have distant metastases, most commonly to the bone, liver, and lung. While the presence of distant metastatic disease has an adverse effect on prognosis, metastases do not necessarily represent a contraindication to resection of the primary tumor, particularly if the metastases are surgically resectable.
