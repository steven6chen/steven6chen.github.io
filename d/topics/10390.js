In one study, 25 percent of patients with type 1 diabetes and 30 percent with type 2 diabetes had a hospital admission during one year; patients with higher values for glycated hemoglobin (A1C) were at highest risk for admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The prevalence of diabetes rises with increasing age, as does the prevalence of other diseases; both factors increase the likelihood that an older person admitted to a hospital will have diabetes.</p><p>The treatment of patients with diabetes who are admitted to the general medical wards of the hospital for a procedure or intercurrent illness is reviewed here. The treatment of hyperglycemia in critically ill patients, the perioperative management of diabetes, and the treatment of complications of the diabetes itself, such as diabetic ketoacidosis, are discussed separately.

These goals are not always easy to achieve. On the one hand, the stress of the acute illness tends to raise blood glucose concentrations. On the other hand, the anorexia that often accompanies illness or the need for fasting before a procedure tends to do the opposite. Because the net effect of these countervailing forces is not easily predictable in a given patient, the target blood glucose concentration is usually higher than when the patient is stable.</p><p>Uncertainty regarding goal blood glucose concentration is compounded by the paucity of controlled trials on the benefits and risks of &quot;loose&quot; or &quot;tight&quot; glycemic control in hospitalized patients, with the exception of patients who are critically ill or have had an acute myocardial infarction (MI). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and intensive insulin therapy in critical illness&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-for-acute-myocardial-infarction-in-patients-with-and-without-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control for acute myocardial infarction in patients with and without diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In general, the goals are to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid hypoglycemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid severe hyperglycemia, volume depletion, and electrolyte abnormalities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensure adequate nutrition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess patient educational needs and address deficiencies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensure appropriate glucose control upon discharge until patient can be seen by the clinician managing his or her diabetes as an outpatient</p><p/><p>Critical to achieving these goals is the frequent measurement of glucose, often in capillary blood, with a method that is known to be reliable.

This is especially true in older adults and those with preexisting ischemic heart disease. If the blood glucose falls to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> transient cognitive deficits may also ensue, which can result in falls or aspiration. In a retrospective cohort study of over 2500 patients with diabetes hospitalized in the general wards, inpatient mortality was significantly higher for patients with at least one hypoglycemic (&le;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoidance of hyperglycemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serious hyperglycemia should be avoided (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Prevention and treatment of hyperglycemia'</a> below). Hyperglycemia can cause volume and electrolyte disturbances mediated by osmotic diuresis and may also result in caloric and protein loss in under-insulinized patients.</p><p>Whether or not hyperglycemia imposes an independent risk for infection is a controversial issue. It is a longstanding clinical observation that patients with diabetes are more susceptible to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Furthermore, immune and neutrophil function are impaired during marked hyperglycemia. Most of the studies addressing this question have focused on the risk of postoperative infection (and especially sternal wound infection) following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and they show mixed results. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=susceptibility-to-infections-in-persons-with-diabetes-mellitus#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Susceptibility to infections in persons with diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Are diabetics more susceptible to infection?'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Glycemic targets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are adequate experimental and observational data to recommend avoidance of marked hyperglycemia in patients with or at risk for infection, the precise glycemic target or threshold for noncritically ill or critically ill patients with preexisting diabetes mellitus has not been firmly established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. In the absence of data from clinical trials, the optimal blood glucose goal for hospitalized patients can only be approximate. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Noncritically ill</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most noncritically ill hospitalized patients with diabetes, we suggest a preprandial blood glucose target &lt;140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> with all random glucoses &lt;180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. </p><p>These targets are consistent with the consensus statement by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the clinical practice guideline of the Endocrine Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The ADA suggests a glucose target between 140 and 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (between 7.8 and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> for general hospitalized patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The ADA has not stipulated any differences in target glucose values based on the timing of the measurements, such as preprandial versus postprandial. </p><p>The Endocrine Society recommends premeal targets &lt;140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> and &quot;random&quot; glucose levels &lt;180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. More stringent goals may be appropriate for stable patients with previous good glycemic control, and the goal should be set somewhat higher for older patients and those with severe comorbidities where the heightened risk of hypoglycemia may outweigh any potential benefit.</p><p>A reasonable glycemic goal to avoid hypoglycemia is to achieve fasting blood glucose concentrations no lower than 90 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.0 to 5.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L);</span> this will usually provide a reasonable &quot;cushion&quot; in case the concentration falls further as the patient's illness improves. In general, all glucose levels should be kept below the 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> range to avoid further escalations, which may be associated with dehydration, glycosuria, and caloric loss, and to reduce the risk of infection and, although rare, of developing ketoacidosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Critically ill</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the majority of critically ill patients, we agree with ADA recommendations for a blood glucose target of 140 to 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (7.8 to 10.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Achieving this goal will usually require an insulin infusion, which should be initiated for persistent hyperglycemia greater than 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. The data supporting these glycemic goals are presented separately.

In addition, glucose monitoring should be continued so that appropriate action may be taken.</p><p>The frequency of measurement depends upon the patient's status, the results of earlier measurements, and the steps taken as a result of those measurements. Importantly, in patients with diabetes (or hyperglycemia) who are eating, the blood glucose monitoring should occur just before the meal. In those who are receiving nothing by mouth, the blood glucose monitoring should occur at regular, fixed intervals, usually every six hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Insulin delivery</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3872627742\"><span class=\"h3\">Basal-bolus regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although most patients will have type 2 diabetes, many will require insulin therapy, if only temporarily during inpatient admissions. In such patients, insulin may be given subcutaneously with an intermediate-acting insulin, such as neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH), or a long-acting insulin, such as glargine or detemir, combined with premeal rapid or short-acting insulin in patients who are eating regular meals (ie, a &quot;basal-bolus&quot; regimen) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72627\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72627 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59822\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59822 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Sliding-scale insulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not endorse the routine use of sliding-scale insulin, particularly when prolonged over the course of a hospitalization. It has no role when used alone in those with type 1 diabetes, who always require basal insulin, even when receiving nothing by mouth. In type 2 diabetes patients who are very insulin deficient (typically insulin-treated older individuals, often but not always lean, with longstanding disease and a history of labile glycemic control), the same recommendations apply.</p><p>In the usual patient with type 2 diabetes managed with oral agents and whose glucose control is good on admission, the temporary use of a sliding scale is reasonable for one to two days as the trajectory of the patient's glycemic control becomes apparent (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Correction insulin'</a> below). However, after this period of time, a decision should be made about a more physiological glucose control strategy for the remainder of the hospitalization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72627\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72627 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59822\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59822 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p>The widespread use of the &quot;sliding scale&quot; of insulin administration for hospitalized patients began during the era of urine glucose testing, and it increased after the introduction of rapid capillary blood glucose testing in the last two to three decades. However, there are few data to support its benefit and some evidence of potential harm when the &quot;sliding scale&quot; is applied in a rote fashion, that is, when all patients receive the same orders and, importantly, when the sole form of insulin administered is rapid-acting insulin every four to six hours without underlying provision of basal insulin.</p><p>This was illustrated in an observational study of 171 patients with diabetes who were admitted to a university hospital, 130 of whom (76 percent) were placed on a sliding-scale insulin regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Sliding-scale insulin regimens when administered alone were associated with a threefold higher risk of hyperglycemic episodes as compared with no therapy (relative risk [RR] 2.85 for &quot;aggressive&quot; scales, beginning at blood glucose 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [8.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]</span> and 3.25 for &quot;conservative&quot; scales, beginning at blood glucose 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L;</span> p&lt;0.05]). Thus, in this observational study, the use of sliding-scale insulin alone provided no benefit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Correction insulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Varying doses of short- or rapid-acting insulin can be added to usual premeal short- or rapid-acting insulin in patients on basal-bolus regimens to correct premeal glucose excursions. In this setting, the additional insulin is referred to as &quot;correction insulin&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72627\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72627 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59822\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59822 \">algorithm 2</a>). The dose of correction insulin should be individualized based upon relevant patient characteristics, such as previous level of glucose control, previous insulin requirements, and, if possible, the carbohydrate content of meals. When administered prior to meals, the type of correction insulin (eg, short acting or rapid acting) should be the same as the usual premeal insulin.</p><p>Correction insulin alone may also be used as initial insulin therapy or as a dose-finding strategy in patients with type 2 diabetes previously treated at home with diet or an oral agent who will not be eating regularly during the hospitalization. It is typically administered every six hours as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59822\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59822 \">algorithm 2</a>). It can be given at bedtime in modest doses to correct marked hyperglycemia (&gt;300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [16.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>. However, if the patient is eating and fingerstick glucoses are consistently elevated (&gt;180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [10.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> a combination of intermediate- or long-acting insulin and premeal short- or rapid-acting insulin (ie, a basal-bolus regimen) should be initiated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72627\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72627 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Insulin infusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes admitted to the general medical wards can be treated with subcutaneous insulin. However, many practitioners institute intravenous insulin therapy in certain circumstances, such as those with marked hyperglycemia (blood glucose &gt;300 to 350 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [&gt;16.7 to 19.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> or in type 1 diabetes, especially those undergoing long and difficult surgery or those who will be expected to have significantly curtailed oral nutritional intake for several days postoperatively. There are little data showing that intravenous insulin is superior to subcutaneous insulin. The key point is that the patient should have at least a small amount of insulin circulating at all times, which will significantly increase the likelihood of controlling blood glucose levels during illness.</p><p>In addition, the safe implementation of insulin infusion protocols requires frequent monitoring of blood glucose, which is not typically available on a general medical ward. Practical considerations including skill and availability of the nursing staff may impact the choice of delivery; complex intravenous regimens may be dangerous where nurses are short staffed or inexperienced. Thus, insulin infusions are typically used in critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients, rather than in patients on the general medical wards of the hospital.</p><p>There is a lack of consensus on how to best deliver intravenous insulin infusions, and individual patients may require different strategies. The best protocols take into account not only the prevailing blood glucose, but also its rate of change and the current insulin infusion rate. Several published insulin infusion protocols appear to be both safe and effective, with low rates of hypoglycemia, although most have been validated only in the ICU setting, where the nurse-to-patient ratio is higher than on the general medical and surgical wards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]. There are few published reports on such protocols outside of the critical care setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-intensive-insulin-therapy-in-critical-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and intensive insulin therapy in critical illness&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the course of giving an intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a> infusion, we recommend starting with approximately half the patient's usual total daily insulin dose, divided into hourly increments until the trend of blood glucose values is known, and then adjusting the dose accordingly. A reasonable regimen usually involves a continuous insulin infusion at a rate of 1 to 5 units of regular insulin per hour; within this range, the dose of insulin is increased or decreased according to the patient's usual insulin dose. In patients who are not eating, concomitant glucose infusion is necessary to provide some calories, reduce protein loss, and decrease the risk of hypoglycemia; separate infusions allow for more flexible control.</p><p>When the patient receiving intravenous insulin is more stable and the intercurrent event has passed, the prior insulin regimen can be resumed, assuming that it was effective in achieving glycemic goals. Because of the short half-life of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a>, the first dose of subcutaneous insulin must be given before discontinuation of the intravenous insulin infusion. If intermediate- or long-acting insulin is used, it should be given two to three hours prior to discontinuation, whereas short- or rapid-acting insulin should be given one to two hours prior to stopping the infusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with type 2 diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes depends upon previous therapy and the current blood glucose concentration. Any patient who takes insulin before hospitalization should receive insulin throughout the admission (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72627\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72627 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59822\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59822 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>For a patient previously under reasonable control (A1C &le;8 percent) at home with diet or an oral agent, correction insulin alone (varying doses of short- or rapid-acting insulin) is a good initial treatment strategy (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Correction insulin'</a> above). If the patient is unable to eat, oral agents should be discontinued. In patients who are eating and who do not have contraindications to their oral agent, oral agents may be continued (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Patients treated with oral agents'</a> below). However, if contraindications develop or if blood glucoses are persistently elevated (&gt;180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [10.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> these drugs should be discontinued and a more formal and comprehensive insulin regimen prescribed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72627\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72627 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59822\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59822 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p>Therapy should be returned to the patient's previous regimen (assuming that it had been effective) as soon as possible after the acute episode, usually as soon as the patient has resumed eating his or her usual diet. In those with elevated A1C upon admission, the discharge regimen should be modified to improve control, or at the very least, the patient should be evaluated by the clinician managing his or her diabetes soon (within several weeks) after discharge.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Diet-treated patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Type 2 diabetic patients treated by diet alone who are to have minor surgery or an imaging procedure, or who have a noncritical acute illness that is expected to be short lived, will typically need no specific antihyperglycemic therapy. Nevertheless, frequent blood glucose monitoring is warranted to identify serious hyperglycemia. The measurement system used should be standardized to ensure reasonable accuracy and precision.

Alternatively, requirements can be based upon the total number of units of correction insulin administered over the course of a hospital day.

However, there are some circumstances where insulin may not be necessary. As an example, in patients who are well controlled on their outpatient regimen, who are eating, and in whom no change in their medical condition or nutritional intake is anticipated, oral agents may be continued, as long as new contraindications are neither present nor anticipated during the hospital admission.</p><p>If a patient was previously eating but is unable to eat after the evening meal in preparation for a procedure the next morning, oral hypoglycemic drugs should be omitted on the day of a procedure (surgical or diagnostic). If procedures are arranged as early in the day as possible, antihyperglycemic therapy and food intake can simply then be shifted to later in the day.</p><p>If the illness requiring admission is more severe (eg, an infection requiring hospitalization), hyperglycemia is more likely, even when there is decreased food intake, and most acutely ill patients will need insulin. In this setting, oral agents should be discontinued. Overt hyperglycemia (&gt;180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [10.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> in patients previously treated with oral agents can be treated briefly with intermittent, subcutaneous doses of regular (every six hours) or rapid-acting (every four to six hours) insulin, provided the blood glucose is not severely elevated, responds well to the insulin, and the problem lasts only a day or two at most (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Correction insulin'</a> above). However, a more formal and comprehensive insulin regimen, including some form of basal insulin, is usually preferred when hyperglycemia persists (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72627\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72627 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59822\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59822 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p>Oral agents should never be administered to patients who are not eating.

As an example, in a trial of <span class=\"nowrap\">detemir/aspart</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">NPH/regular</span> in 130 hospitalized patients, there was no difference in glycemic control or frequency of hypoglycemia between the two regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In some studies, treatment with such a basal-bolus insulin regimen was associated with better glycemic outcomes than sliding-scale insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. As an example, in one open-label, randomized trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin glargine</a> supplemented with preprandial glulisine versus sliding-scale insulin, a greater proportion of patients treated with the basal-bolus regimen achieved target glucose values (66 versus 38 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, in this study, the mean daily dose of insulin was more than threefold higher in the basal-bolus-treated patients than in those assigned to sliding scale, likely reflecting a failure to titrate the doses of sliding-scale insulin. In some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>], trials, better glycemic control with basal-bolus versus sliding-scale insulin was associated with more hypoglycemia (glucose &lt;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [3.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]</span> in 23.1 and 4.7 percent of patients, respectively, and &lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]</span> in 3.8 and 0 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>U-500 insulin</strong> &ndash; Patients treated with U-500 <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a> at home may continue U-500 (with a 25 to 50 percent dose reduction since control often improves in the hospital in patients requiring large doses of insulin at home), if it is available from the hospital formulary. Because the high concentration of insulin delays absorption, the pharmacologic profile of U-500 regular insulin is most similar to that of NPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Thus, if U-500 is not available, U-100 NPH insulin should be substituted (with a 25 to 50 percent dose reduction).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We would also caution that errors are common with U-500 administration, and clear communication among patient, clinician, nursing staff, and pharmacy is imperative to ensure proper dosing. Although in the past U-500 insulin was dispensed using Tuberculin or U-100 syringes, a dedicated U-500 insulin syringe is available (as of November 2016), and U-500 insulin should be dispensed with the U-500 insulin syringe, if possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The syringe contains scale markings from 25 to 250 units in 5-unit increments (total volume 0.5 mL). The insulin dose should be expressed in units, rather than in volumetric terms as was the convention with the Tuberculin or U-100 syringes. U-500 insulin syringes are not available with a safety needle and, therefore, may not be provided in some facilities. In such cases, the U-500 insulin pen device may be used. The pen dosing window shows the number of units of U-500 to be injected, and the pen delivers the volume that corresponds to the selected dose. The pen contains 1500 units (500 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> of insulin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If neither dedicated U-500 insulin syringes nor the U-500 insulin pen device is available, U-500 insulin can be dispensed using a Tuberculin syringe, rather than a U-100 insulin syringe, to emphasize that it is different from U-100 <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a>. With the Tuberculin syringe, every 0.1 mL would equal 50 units of insulin. The obvious concern when using U-500 insulin with a Tuberculin syringe is the potential for confusion of volume and units. For institutions using Tuberculin syringes to deliver U-500 insulin, therefore, U-500 insulin should be dispensed directly from the hospital pharmacy, in individually labelled Tuberculin syringes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reduced oral intake</strong> &ndash; When food intake is diminished or stopped completely in a patient treated with insulin, short- or rapid-acting insulin is typically discontinued, and the dose of intermediate- or long-acting insulin is reduced. If an episode is clearly short lived (eg, a procedure done in the early morning), subcutaneous insulin (usual dose of short acting and intermediate or long acting) and breakfast can simply be delayed until after the episode.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, if the episode is longer (eg, an operation done in the afternoon with no food intake for the entire day), the patient should not receive any short- or rapid-acting insulin. That morning's dose of subcutaneous intermediate-acting (NPH) or long-acting (glargine, detemir) insulin should be administered at approximately one-half to two-thirds of the usual dose and administered at the usual time, unless hypoglycemia is already present. The subcutaneous dose of intermediate-acting (NPH) or long-acting (glargine, detemir) insulin given the night before may not require any adjustment if previously dosed properly. However, another approach is to reduce the evening dose by approximately 20 percent to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia the next morning. As examples:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A patient who takes 30 units of NPH insulin in the morning might be given 15 to 20 units in the morning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A patient who takes 30 units of glargine in the evening and lispro insulin before each meal might take the same dose of glargine the night before admission but omit the usual dose of preprandial rapid-acting insulin. An alternative approach is to reduce the evening glargine by approximately 20 percent (eg, give 24 units).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In both of these cases, small amounts of short- or rapid-acting insulin can be administered every six hours to correct for significant hyperglycemia (ie, glucose &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>. Intravenous glucose (at approximately 3.75 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/hour,</span> eg, 5 percent dextrose at 75 to 100 mL per hour) should be given to limit the metabolic changes of starvation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Once the patient is taking a normal diet, the usual at-home regimen can be restarted, as long as it was resulting in good glucose control. If altered nutritional intake is present, reduced doses of insulin will be required, starting with doses similar to those administered in the preprocedure setting.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with type 1 diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with type 1 diabetes have an absolute requirement for insulin at <strong>all times</strong>, whether or not they are eating, to prevent ketosis. The doses of insulin needed are usually lower than in patients with type 2 diabetes since most of the former do not have insulin resistance. However, their blood glucose concentrations tend to fluctuate more during the course of the illness or procedure. It is important to avoid hypoglycemia, even if the consequence is a temporary modest rise in the blood glucose concentration.</p><p>Insulin can be given either subcutaneously or intravenously. Algorithms for glycemic management of nonfasting and fasting patients with type 1 diabetes who are not critically ill are shown for subcutaneous dosing regimens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72627\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72627 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59822\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59822 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>If the patient is receiving nothing by mouth, the administration of basal insulin is still required. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For a patient who usually takes 24 units of NPH and 4 units of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a> in the morning, one-half to two-thirds (12 to 16 units) of the usual morning dose of NPH insulin can be given (if the morning blood glucose value is not too low, ie, is at least 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [6.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>. Short- or rapid-acting insulin should not be given, except if significant hyperglycemia (&gt;200 to 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [11.1 to 13.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> is found in the morning. In such cases, only small doses (1 to 4 units) should be given with the goals of reducing the blood glucose level to &lt;180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and avoiding hypoglycemia during the ongoing fast.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For a patient who usually takes 20 units of glargine every evening and short-acting insulin before each meal (dose based upon prevailing blood sugar and carbohydrate content of meal), the usual dose of glargine can be continued. An alternative approach is to reduce the dose of glargine by 20 percent (eg, give 16 units) to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia that might require oral ingestion of calories and thereby delay the planned procedure. Short-acting insulin should not be given, unless significant hyperglycemia is noted, as described above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For a patient treated with a continuous insulin infusion via a pump, the basal insulin can be continued at the usual rate or the overnight basal rate may be reduced by 20 percent to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia the next morning. No boluses would be administered until the patient is able to eat. Since nursing staff are not always familiar or comfortable with the use of insulin pumps, patients should be alert enough to manage their pump therapy. In addition, vigilance regarding pump catheter placement is necessary. Catheters may inadvertently be dislodged during transfers in the operating room or in bed, and if the patient is not alert enough to provide self-care, the health care providers should consider changing to conventional injection therapy until the patient is able to manage pump therapy again.</p><p/><p>In all of these cases, blood glucose is measured every two to three hours until the meal is eaten. Small amounts of short- or rapid-acting insulin can be administered every six hours to correct hyperglycemia (ie, glucose &gt;150 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [8.3 to 11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>. Intravenous glucose (at approximately 3.75 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/hour,</span> eg, 5 percent dextrose at 75 to 100 mL per hour) should be given to limit the metabolic changes of starvation.

To determine the correct dose of insulin to add to the TPN fluid, a separate infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a> can be used initially. When glucoses have reached goal, the total daily dose of regular insulin provided by the insulin drip is calculated; 80 percent of this amount is added to the TPN fluid as regular insulin to be delivered over 24 hours. For example, if the intravenous insulin infusion at steady state was set at 1 unit per hour (or 24 units per day), 80 percent of this amount (or 19 units) should be added to the TPN solution by the pharmacy to be given over the course of the day. The amount of insulin can then be titrated every one to two days, based upon glucose monitoring. Since more frequent adjustments are impractical and costly, the concurrent use of rapid- or short-acting insulin as correction every six hours will help to fine-tune the control. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Correction insulin'</a> above.)</p><p>If TPN is interrupted, most patients with type 2 diabetes can be followed with careful glucose monitoring. Insulin should be administered if hyperglycemia occurs. In patients with type 1 diabetes, hyperglycemia will occur and can result in ketosis if all insulin is withheld. Thus, patients with type 1 diabetes require insulin when the TPN is interrupted. The amount and type of insulin depend upon the anticipated duration of the interruption. Because of the potential for inadvertent discontinuation of insulin therapy if TPN is interrupted, some clinicians recommend giving a portion of the basal insulin as an injection (eg, 50 percent) in patients with type 1 diabetes. In the example above (patient receiving 24 units of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a> a day, 80 percent of this amount [19 units] added to the TPN solution), approximately 10 units of regular insulin can be added to the TPN solution and 9 units of NPH, glargine, or detemir administered as a basal injection. This approach can also be used in insulin-requiring patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Enteral feedings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients receiving continuous enteral feeds, the total daily dose of insulin could be administered as basal insulin alone (once daily glargine or twice daily detemir or NPH). However, if the enteral feeds are unexpectedly discontinued, hypoglycemia may occur. Thus, a safer approach may be to administer approximately 50 percent of the total daily insulin dose as basal insulin and 50 percent as prandial (short- or rapid-acting) insulin, which is given every four (rapid-acting insulin) to six (short-acting insulin) hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A similar ratio of basal-to-prandial insulin can be used for patients receiving bolus feeds, for whom the prandial insulin would be divided equally before each bolus feed. Correction rapid- or short-acting insulin can then be administered, as needed, with the prandial insulin (same type). In those receiving cycled enteral feeding (eg, 8 to 10 hours overnight), the ideal insulin may be NPH, which has an activity profile similar to this duration, its effect waning when the feeds are stopped. Again, correction rapid- or short-acting insulin can then be administered as needed to optimize control. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Correction insulin'</a> above.)</p><p>Another approach is to use short-acting insulin alone. This approach is supported by the findings of a randomized trial of sliding-scale, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-regular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regular insulin</a> every four to six hours alone or in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin glargine</a> in 50 noncritically ill patients with diabetes receiving enteral nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Insulin doses were adjusted daily based upon fingerstick blood glucose measurements, and NPH insulin was added in the sliding-scale, regular insulin group when glucose levels persistently exceeded 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. There were no differences in any glycemic measures (mean study glucose, mean peak or nadir glucose, hypoglycemia events, or total daily insulin dose) between the two groups. However, NPH insulin was required in 48 percent of subjects randomly assigned to sliding-scale, regular insulin. Thus, when sliding-scale, regular insulin alone is chosen as the initial management strategy for patients receiving enteral feeds, the addition of basal insulin is often required to maintain adequate glycemic control.</p><p>If the enteral feeds (continuous or bolus) are unexpectedly discontinued, an intravenous 10 percent dextrose solution, providing a similar number of carbohydrate calories as was being administered via the enteral feeds, should be infused in order to prevent hypoglycemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Consultation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the time, the treatment of hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes in these stressful circumstances can be done by the patient's internist or generalist. However, each clinician needs to decide whether or not the patient would benefit from additional advice; consultation with a diabetes specialist or endocrinologist may help, particularly if accompanied by a team including personnel who can provide patient education and nutritional advice. This team approach can decrease the patient's length of stay as well as decrease the total cost of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Using the hospitalization to enhance the patient's knowledge about the disease and to improve self-management is encouraged.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of overall care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A brief hospitalization is an excellent opportunity to assess or reassess overall care in patients with diabetes. If appropriate, attention should be paid to preventive measures (such as smoking cessation, control of hypertension, treatment of dyslipidemia, and appropriate vaccinations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-hospitalized-patients/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], glycemic control, assessment of possible complications of diabetes, and overall patient education. This should lead to the formulation of a plan for future treatment after the patient is discharged. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of medical care in adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In type 2 diabetes, an insulin regimen may not be necessary after the illness requiring hospitalization has resolved. In addition, even when such a regimen is considered to be the ideal outpatient therapy upon discharge, the patient may not be able to comply safely with the prescribed insulin program, which requires a degree of education, commitment, and self-discipline not exhibited by all. Thus, it is important to determine both the insulin needs as well as the self-care capacities of each patient prior to discharge. Optimal regimens should be individualized for each patient.</p><p>Patients may require a significant dose adjustment (usually a lowering of the dose) after discharge from the hospital, which is why clear communication between the clinician dealing with the acute illness and the clinician who will follow the patient's diabetes care after discharge is so important. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of medical care in adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients found to be newly hyperglycemic during times of illness may actually have undiagnosed diabetes. A glycohemoglobin assay (A1C) can help discriminate between acute, stress-related hyperglycemia and preexistent diabetes. At a minimum, these individuals should be retested as outpatients upon full recovery. Adequate patient education, discharge planning, and the important transition to the outpatient arena are facilitated by nursing personnel dedicated to diabetes care at each institution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1131595190\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
