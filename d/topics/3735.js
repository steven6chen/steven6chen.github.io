During sleep, most patients with RLS have characteristic limb movements, called periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS), which may or may not be associated with arousal from sleep.</p><p>Although long referred to as RLS, the eponymous name was adopted by the RLS Foundation from 2011 to 2015 in an effort to move away from the term restless legs, which was felt to be poorly representative of the true nature of the disorder and demeaning by many of those affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The name WED recognizes the original description by Dr. Thomas Willis in the 17<sup>th</sup> century and seminal case series published by Dr. Karl-Axel Ekbom in the 1940s.</p><p>Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) is characterized by a clinical sleep disturbance attributed to an increased number of PLMS, in the absence of alternative causes of the sleep complaints. PLMD and RLS are distinct, mutually exclusive diagnoses.</p><p>This topic will discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of RLS and PLMD in adults. Treatment of RLS and PLMD in adults, RLS during pregnancy and lactation, and RLS and PLMD in children are reviewed separately.

There is no evidence that neurodegeneration plays a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69784376\"><span class=\"h2\">Central nervous system correlates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most consistently implicated central nervous system (CNS) alteration in patients with RLS is reduced central iron stores; dopaminergic systems, circadian physiology, thalamic function, and other neurotransmitters such as glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) have also been implicated.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Iron</strong> &ndash; Reduced CNS iron stores are a robust and consistent finding in RLS, even in the setting of normal systemic iron studies. This finding has been demonstrated in several ways:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ferritin is lower in RLS cases compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies show reduced iron stores in the striatum, thalamus, and red nucleus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CNS ultrasonography has identified reduced iron echogenicity in the substantia nigra of patients with RLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Additionally, mitochondrial ferritin is increased in neurons in the substantia nigra but not the putamen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Autopsy specimens of patients with RLS show reduced ferritin and iron staining, increased transferrin staining, and reduced transferrin receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The reduced transferrin receptor finding is especially important since globally reduced iron stores would normally upregulate transferrin receptors, suggesting a more complicated process than simple lack of availability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Taken together, these data suggest that reduced intracellular iron indices in primary RLS are associated with a perturbation of homeostatic mechanisms that regulate iron influx <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> efflux from the cell.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dopaminergic systems</strong> &ndash; The relationship between RLS and CNS dopaminergic systems is complex and not fully understood. Although the observation that RLS symptoms improve with dopaminergic therapy strongly implicates CNS dopamine in the pathogenesis of RLS, there is little pathologic evidence to suggest an actual dopaminergic deficiency in the striatum or substantia nigra of patients with the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similarly, numerous brain dopamine imaging studies have yielded inconsistent results, generally showing either modest or no abnormalities in various aspects of dopaminergic neurotransmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. Dopamine precursor studies have shown normal or reduced dopamine levels; dopamine transporter studies have shown levels to be normal or reduced; and dopamine receptor studies have shown reduced, normal, or increased activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is indirect evidence that dopamine turnover may actually be increased in RLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. As an example, one study found that CSF 3-ortho-methldopa (3-OMD) levels were increased in RLS subjects, suggesting either a general increase in dopamine metabolism or increased monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) activity, which metabolizes dopamine to 3-OMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These data have led some to speculate that RLS is a disease of hyperdopaminergic function. However, this model cannot explain the dramatic and immediate benefit of dopaminergic therapy in RLS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Several studies have observed that the normal circadian dopaminergic variation is augmented in patients with RLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. The specific dopaminergic anatomy has been hypothesized to involve the diencephalospinal dopaminergic tract, originating in the A11-A14 nuclei of the hypothalamus. This could explain the preponderance of leg symptoms in RLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

In one small pathologic study, numbers of thalamic beta-endorphin positive cells and met-enkephalin positive cells were reduced in RLS patients compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Voxel-based MRI studies have inconsistently shown increased pulvinar size, and sometimes decreased cortical gray matter, in patients with RLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Others have shown reduced metabolite activity (reduced N-acetylaspartate to creatine ratio) in the medial thalamus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69783806\"><span class=\"h2\">Peripheral pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The peripheral afferent nervous system has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of RLS. In a series of studies, pinprick pain ratings (ie, static hyperalgesia) in patients with RLS were significantly elevated in the leg, whereas pain in response to light touch (ie, dynamic mechanical hyperalgesia or allodynia) was normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. The authors concluded that this type of hyperalgesia was probably mediated by central sensitization to A-delta fiber high-threshold mechanoreceptor input, a hallmark sign of hyperalgesic neuropathic pain.</p><p>Abnormalities of microvascular function in the legs have also been demonstrated in individuals with RLS, including altered leg intramuscular blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>], peripheral hypoxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], and altered endothelial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H824782937\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite considerable attention given to restless legs syndrome (RLS) genetics, many patients who suffer from RLS do not have an identifiable or highly penetrant genetic pattern. Patients without a positive family history are classified as either primary RLS, if no other explanation is found, or secondary RLS, if they have a comorbid condition known to be associated with RLS.</p><p>The most common conditions associated with RLS include iron deficiency, renal failure, neuropathy, spinal cord pathology, pregnancy, multiple sclerosis, and possibly Parkinson disease (PD) and essential tremor; each of these is discussed in more detail below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2057035971\"><span class=\"h2\">Family history and genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With careful questioning, a family history of RLS is present in 40 to 60 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Twin studies also show a very high concordance rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Most pedigrees suggest an autosomal dominant pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], although an autosomal recessive pattern with a very high carrier rate is also possible.</p><p>Despite many positive linkage studies, however, no specific gene mutations have been identified to date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Numerous candidate genes have been explored, including those involved with dopamine metabolism, Parkinson disease, neurodegeneration, and systemic iron regulation. Results have generally been unrevealing, although the alpha-synuclein promoter Rep1 allele 2, which is a risk factor for Parkinson disease, seems to protect against RLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>]. Whole exome sequencing of an RLS family suggested <em>PCDHA3</em> as a candidate gene, but this finding remains preliminary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Genome-wide association studies have found nearly 20 potential risk factor genes that have been replicated in multiple populations, including <em>MEIS1, BTBDP</em>, <em><span class=\"nowrap\">MAP2K5/LBOXCOR1</em>,</span> <em>PRPRD</em>, and <em>TOX3</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/56-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-62</a>]. Identification of the function of these genes is ongoing. Several of the candidates are thought to be developmental genes; at least one has been associated with iron regulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. As with other common conditions, the genetics of RLS are complex and probably involve the presence of multiple risk alleles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3822511321\"><span class=\"h2\">Low iron stores</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reduced central nervous system (CNS) iron is a consistent finding in RLS (see <a href=\"#H69784376\" class=\"local\">'Central nervous system correlates'</a> above). It follows intuitively that reduced body iron stores could translate into low CNS intracellular iron and thereby cause or exacerbate RLS symptoms; clinical observations largely bear this out.</p><p>In multiple studies, low serum ferritin levels (&lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L)</span> correlate with RLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/12,13,64-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,64-67</a>].

It should be noted that ferritin is an acute phase reactant and that &quot;normal&quot; levels increase with age. Therefore, a &quot;normal&quot; range ferritin does not exclude iron deficiency.

A single diagnostic question, &quot;When you try to relax in the evening or sleep at night, do you ever have unpleasant, restless feelings in your legs that can be relieved by walking or movement?&quot; has also shown good predictive power to diagnose RLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults/abstract/160\" class=\"abstract_t\">160</a>].</p><p>A polysomnographic evaluation is not required for the diagnosis of RLS. It is usually reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is in doubt, in cases where periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS) are suspected to be severe and result in arousals, or if other sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, are suspected.</p><p>Occasionally, symptoms of RLS cannot be distinguished from those of a neuropathy by history alone (ie, sensations beginning in the feet or superficial pain), or there are risk factors for neuropathy (eg, diabetes) or signs of a peripheral neuropathy on physical examination. In such cases, nerve conduction velocities (NCV) and electromyogram (EMG) are useful to determine whether further etiologic evaluation for a peripheral neuropathy is necessary. Small fiber neuropathy, which is not always identified by <span class=\"nowrap\">NCV/EMG,</span> can also contribute to RLS symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59300510\"><span class=\"h2\">Periodic limb movement disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) is diagnosed based on a clinical history of sleep disturbance or daytime fatigue, combined with polysomnography (PSG) showing an excessive number of periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS), and exclusion of alternative causes of the sleep complaints.

(See <a href=\"#H69784390\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RLS is common, affecting 5 to 15 percent of adults in studies that include primarily Caucasian populations. Estimates of clinically significant (moderate to severe) RLS are lower (2 to 3 percent). RLS is less common in certain regions and ethnic groups, including Asia and Africa. (See <a href=\"#H69784369\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathophysiologic basis of RLS is poorly understood, although studies have identified a variety of both central and peripheral nervous system abnormalities in patients with the disorder. The most consistently implicated central nervous system (CNS) alteration is reduced central iron stores. (See <a href=\"#H69783302\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A family history of RLS is present in 40 to 60 percent of cases, but no highly penetrant causative gene mutations have been identified to date. As with other common conditions, the genetics of RLS are complex and probably involve the presence of multiple risk alleles. (See <a href=\"#H2057035971\" class=\"local\">'Family history and genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although most cases of RLS are considered to be primary or idiopathic, certain comorbid conditions are commonly associated with RLS, including systemic low iron stores, uremia, neuropathy, spinal cord disease, and pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H824782937\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS) occur in more than 80 percent of patients with RLS who undergo polysomnography. However, they are not specific to the disorder; the prevalence of PLMS in the general population increases with age and is reported to occur in as many as approximately 60 percent of older adults. (See <a href=\"#H69787559\" class=\"local\">'Periodic limb movements of sleep'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common mimics of RLS are volitional movements such as foot tapping, akathisia, nocturnal leg cramps, positional discomfort, and leg pain from a variety of causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F101047\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101047 \">table 1</a>). In most cases, these can be distinguished from RLS by history and physical examination.
