LPP is considered a follicular form of lichen planus based upon shared pathologic features and the frequent coexistence of clinical findings of these disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lichen-planus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lichen planus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>LPP is divided into three clinical variants:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classic LPP</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Graham-Little-Piccardi-Lasseur syndrome (Graham-Little syndrome, GLPLS)</p><p/><p>The three variants of LPP are distinguished primarily by the clinical pattern of involvement. Whereas patchy scalp involvement is a common presentation of classic LPP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90009\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90009 \">picture 1</a>), band-like alopecia involving the frontal scalp is typical of FFA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90010\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90010 \">picture 2</a>). GLPLS is defined by a triad of features: cicatricial alopecia on the scalp, noncicatricial alopecia in the axillae and groin, and widespread lichenoid follicular papules. </p><p>The treatment of LPP is challenging due to a paucity of data on the efficacy of therapies and an inconsistent response to treatment. However, because uncontrolled LPP results in irreversible hair loss, rapid diagnosis and the prompt institution of treatment are important for the management of patients with LPP.</p><p>The diagnosis and management of LPP will be reviewed here. Lichen planus is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lichen-planus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lichen planus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3450975\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The participants of a 2001 workshop on cicatricial alopecia sponsored by the North American Hair Research Society proposed a classification scheme for cicatricial alopecias that is primarily based upon the pathologic features of each disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Lichen planopilaris (LPP) was classified as a primary lymphocytic cicatricial alopecia, a member of a group of inflammatory scalp disorders that demonstrate a lymphocyte-predominant inflammatory infiltrate, follicular destruction, and permanent hair loss. The classification of the cicatricial alopecias is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss#H1871427\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;, section on 'Cicatricial alopecia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H692396\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologic data on lichen planopilaris (LPP) are limited. Although it is accepted that LPP is uncommon, the incidence and prevalence of LPP are unknown. Data from select North American tertiary hair research centers suggest that patients with LPP account for less than 1 percent to 8 percent of new patients who present to such centers for evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>Adults between the ages of 25 and 70 years are the primary population affected by LPP; however, LPP also is occasionally observed in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/2,4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-6</a>]. A retrospective study of 45 patients with classic LPP found a mean age of onset of 52 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>All three variants of LPP appear to be more common in females than in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/2,4,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,7,8</a>]. In the retrospective study of 45 patients with classic LPP mentioned above, the female to male ratio was 4:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Other studies have found less dramatic sex differences; in a retrospective study of 25 patients with LPP, the female to male ratio was 1.8:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Postmenopausal women are the primary population affected by the frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) variant of LPP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. In a retrospective study of 355 patients with FFA (343 women and 12 men), the mean age was 56 years (range 21 to 81 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although Graham-Little-Piccardi-Lasseur syndrome (GLPLS) can occur in males, most of the reported cases have occurred in Caucasian women between the ages of 30 and 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Data are insufficient for definitive conclusions about racial or ethnic predilections for LPP. The possibility of a reduced risk in individuals of Asian origin was suggested by data from a tertiary hair center in Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although Asians (not including East Indians) accounted for 25 percent of the 3500 patients evaluated at the center over five years, only one of the 25 patients with LPP was Asian. Additional studies are necessary to confirm whether there are racial or ethnic differences in the prevalence of LPP.</p><p>Patients with LPP may have an increased risk for thyroid disease. In a case-control study of 166 patients with LPP and 81 control patients evaluated in a dermatology clinic, thyroid disease was significantly more frequent among patients with LPP (34 versus 11 percent of patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Hypothyroidism was the most common thyroid abnormality in both groups. Further study will be useful for confirming a relationship between LPP and thyroid disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27065825\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of lichen planopilaris (LPP) is poorly understood. Similar to cutaneous lichen planus, LPP is postulated to be an immune-mediated disorder characterized by an autoreactive, lymphocytic inflammatory process against an unknown self-antigen. In LPP, follicular antigens may be the target of a cell-mediated cytotoxic immune reaction. </p><p>The permanent loss of hair that characterizes LPP is postulated to emanate from the site in which inflammation occurs. Unlike alopecia areata, a nonscarring form of hair loss in which inflammation is most concentrated around the follicular bulb, LPP demonstrates an inflammatory infiltrate concentrated around the follicular infundibulum and isthmus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53952 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90012\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90012 \">picture 3</a>). The follicular &quot;bulge,&quot; a site of pluripotent stem cells involved in regeneration of the lower portion of the hair follicle during follicular cycling is located within this same region. Damage to the bulge region may account for the development of permanent alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Endogenous or exogenous agents, such as drugs, viruses, or contact sensitizers have been proposed as potential triggers for the autoimmune response observed in LPP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/4,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15,16</a>]. Binding of components of these agents to keratinocytes could represent an initial trigger for an inflammatory process. However, a role for specific endogenous or exogenous factors remains unclear.</p><p>Other observations that may offer insight into the pathogenesis of LPP include the detection of reduced expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma in specimens of LPP, and the detection of antibodies against the INCENP protein in a patient with Graham-Little-Piccardi-Lasseur syndrome (GLPLS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. PPAR-gamma is a transcription factor that may be critical for the maintenance of normal pilosebaceous units and INCENP is a component of the centromere involved in cell mitosis. In addition, the predilection of frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) for postmenopausal women and the apparent response of some cases to antiandrogenic treatment has raised questions about whether androgens are involved in the pathogenesis of FFA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/9,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,19</a>]. Further study is necessary to determine the relevance of a retrospective study that found a higher rate of early menopause among women with FFA than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27065839\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classic lichen planopilaris (LPP), frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA), and Graham-Little-Piccardi-Lasseur syndrome (GLPLS) have both overlapping and distinct clinical features. Perifollicular inflammation, follicular hyperkeratosis, and cicatricial alopecia occur in all three variants. The distribution of involvement is the most prominent distinguishing clinical feature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H692723\"><span class=\"h2\">Classic lichen planopilaris</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common sites for initial involvement in classic lichen planopilaris (LPP) are the vertex and parietal areas of the scalp. The earliest clinical signs are perifollicular erythema and follicular hyperkeratosis manifesting as perifollicular keratotic spines or follicular keratotic plugs. Eventually, patients develop skin-colored or erythematous patches of alopecia that are a few millimeters to a few centimeters in breadth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90006\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90006 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Close examination will reveal markedly reduced or absent follicular ostia. Occasionally, residual islands of normal or inflamed hair-bearing follicles remain within the patches of alopecia.</p><p>Perifollicular erythema and follicular hyperkeratosis often remain evident at the periphery of areas of alopecia in patients with active disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Tufted hairs similar to those seen in folliculitis decalvans also may be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The extent of scalp involvement varies; patients may present with single or multiple scalp lesions and involvement may be focal or extensive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90008\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90008 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/2,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21</a>]. Small patches of alopecia can slowly progress and become interconnected, leading to a reticulated pattern of alopecia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90009\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90009 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Associated itching, burning, or scalp tenderness is common. Rarely, linear presentations of LPP on the face or trunk occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. </p><p>Concomitant features of cutaneous, nail, or mucosal lichen planus are not uncommon in patients with LPP. It is estimated at the time of presentation, 17 to 28 percent of patients with LPP have evidence of lichen planus in other body sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Involvement of other sites may precede or follow the development of LPP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H692730\"><span class=\"h2\">Frontal fibrosing alopecia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FFA is characterized by the development of frontotemporal loss of both terminal and vellus hairs. Hair loss occurs in a band-like distribution that is usually 1 to 8 cm in diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90010\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90010 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/20,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,26</a>]. Often, a small number of isolated hairs are spared within the band of alopecia, a finding that has been referred to as the &quot;lonely hair sign&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/8,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,27</a>]. Similar to classic LPP, erythematous and hyperkeratotic follicles are often found at the periphery of areas of alopecia. Hypopigmentation may also be evident in the affected area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Pruritus or trichodynia may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Involvement of other scalp sites, such as the periauricular, parietal, or occipital areas, may accompany the classic distribution of FFA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90011\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90011 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In addition, in a retrospective study of 60 women with FFA, diffuse features of LPP on the scalp were found in 8 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Men may have involvement of the sideburns and facial hair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>Eyebrow involvement is common in FFA, occurring in 50 to 83 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Eyebrow involvement may precede or follow scalp disease. Eyelash involvement also may occur, though it is less common. In a retrospective study of 355 patients with FFA in Spain, 14 percent had eyelash involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Men with FFA may experience beard involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Patients with FFA also may develop hair loss in areas other than the scalp and face. Body, axillary, or pubic hair loss was documented in 24, 21, and 18 percent of patients in the Spanish retrospective study, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>In addition, involvement of vellus hair follicles on the face manifesting as facial papules or follicular red dots has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Facial papules were detected in 14 percent of patients in the Spanish retrospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Other reported facial manifestations include diffuse erythema resulting from a follicular and interfollicular lichenoid infiltrate and the gradual appearance of pigmented macules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H692737\"><span class=\"h2\">Graham-Little-Piccardi-Lasseur syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GLPLS has three clinical components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cicatricial (scarring) alopecia of the scalp with features of LPP</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noncicatricial (nonscarring) alopecia involving axillary and pubic hair</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lichenoid follicular eruption on the trunk, limbs, face, or eyebrows </p><p/><p>Cicatricial alopecia usually precedes the other manifestations of GLPLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1160512399\"><span class=\"h2\">Other presentations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A subtype of LPP that presents with hair loss in a pattern similar to androgenetic alopecia has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Occasionally, rapid and extensive hair loss occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Data on prognostic factors for LPP are limited. The findings of a Spanish retrospective study of 355 patients with frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) suggest that patients with eyelash loss, facial papules, or body hair involvement may be at increased risk for severe FFA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Eyebrow loss as the initial clinical presentation was associated with an increased likelihood for mild disease.

The scalp examination may help to narrow the differential diagnosis by detecting clinical signs that distinguish cicatricial alopecia (absent follicular ostia) from noncicatricial alopecia (preserved follicular ostia), or by identifying features characteristically associated with LPP (eg, patchy or frontal alopecia, perifollicular inflammation, and follicular hyperkeratosis). The examination may also provide clues about disease activity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss#H638362\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a> and <a href=\"#H3968621\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic approach'</a> below.)</p><p>Performance of a full skin examination allows for the detection of cutaneous or mucous membrane findings of lichen planus, which can occur in patients with LPP. In addition, the skin examination may reveal findings that suggest Graham-Little-Piccardi-Lasseur syndrome (GLPLS), rather than classic LPP.

Areas of complete alopecia should be avoided.</p><p>We typically perform two 4 mm punch biopsies in patients who have clinical findings suggestive of LPP. The receipt of two punch biopsies, rather than a single biopsy, is preferred by many dermatopathologists, as it allows for evaluation of the hair follicles in both horizontal and vertical sections.

In most cases, local treatments are the initial therapeutic choice due to the relative safety of these interventions. Systemic therapy is primarily used for patients who fail to respond to local therapy or who initially present with rapidly progressive or extensive disease.

A 2013 systematic review of the English language literature identified 79 patients with biopsy-proven LPP who had documentation of their response to topical corticosteroid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The review found author documentation of good, partial, and absent treatment responses in 53, 27, and 15 percent of patients, respectively. </p><p>The largest case series identified in the systematic review was a retrospective case series of 30 patients with LPP. Treatment with a topical corticosteroid (twice daily for three weeks, once daily for three weeks, and every other day for approximately six weeks) was associated with clearing of inflammation and inhibition of progression of cicatricial lesions in 20 patients (67 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Six patients (20 percent) had a lesser degree of improvement, and four patients (13 percent) did not appear to respond to therapy. </p><p>The best topical corticosteroid regimen for LPP is unknown. Our preference is to prescribe a high potency or super high potency topical corticosteroid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>). We instruct patients to apply the topical corticosteroid twice daily to areas of active disease. Once it appears that disease activity has subsided, we slowly taper the frequency of application. If there is no evidence of a response to topical corticosteroid therapy within four months, we consider alternative modes of treatment.</p><p>Cutaneous atrophy is a potential adverse effect of topical corticosteroids. However, the scalp is less likely to develop cosmetically significant atrophy from topical corticosteroid use than many other areas. Additional adverse effects of topical corticosteroids are reviewed in detail separately.

Only a few retrospective case series and case reports have evaluated intralesional corticosteroid therapy for LPP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The largest series, a retrospective case series of 20 patients treated with intralesional corticosteroid injections documented good responses in 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. &quot;Good&quot; responders were required to demonstrate stabilization of disease with greater than a minimal response to treatment, greater than minimal hair regrowth, and a greater than minimal reduction in symptoms. Unstable disease with a lesser degree of improvement was observed in 50 percent of patients, and 10 percent of patients worsened. </p><p>The authors of a separate retrospective case series that included seven patients treated with intralesional corticosteroid injection did not document improvement in any patients, but also did not report the measures used to assess response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The regimen used for intralesional corticosteroid therapy was not described in either series.</p><p>Our experience suggests that intralesional corticosteroid therapy can be beneficial. We find that intralesional corticosteroids reduce clinical signs of inflammation significantly. We have also noticed that symptoms such as tenderness, itching, and burning can improve after one or two sessions of intralesional corticosteroid therapy. </p><p>Our typical treatment regimen consists of the injection of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> for lesions in the frontal hairline) with a 30-gauge needle every four to six weeks into areas of active disease. Active areas are most commonly found at the periphery of patches of alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-planopilaris/abstract/2,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,20</a>]. Injections of approximately 0.1 mL are spaced approximately 1 cm apart within the involved area. The target depth of injection into the skin is approximately 1 to 2 mm. The dose of triamcinolone acetonide should not exceed 40 mg per treatment session. If a significant reduction of clinical signs of inflammation and symptoms is not evident within four months, we transition to alternative treatment.</p><p>A disadvantage of intralesional corticosteroid therapy compared with topical corticosteroid therapy is the pain associated with treatment. However, most patients tolerate injections without the need for anesthesia; topical anesthetics may be used for those patients who need them. </p><p>Intralesional corticosteroid therapy occasionally causes cutaneous atrophy that manifests as indentations in the scalp. When this occurs, we discontinue treating the site of atrophy until it resolves (usually several months). Other adverse effects of intralesional corticosteroid injection are reviewed separately.

There are three major variants of LPP: classic LPP, frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA), and Graham-Little-Piccardi-Lasseur syndrome (GLPLS). (See <a href=\"#H27065818\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3450975\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LPP most commonly occurs in adults. Women are more likely to be affected than men. Most reported cases of FFA have occurred in postmenopausal women. (See <a href=\"#H692396\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major clinical features of classic LPP are perifollicular erythema, perifollicular hyperkeratosis, and skin-colored or erythematous patches of alopecia on the scalp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90009\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90009 \">picture 1</a>). Patients may experience symptoms of itching, burning, or scalp tenderness. In addition, patients may have accompanying cutaneous, mucosal, or nail findings of lichen planus. (See <a href=\"#H692723\" class=\"local\">'Classic lichen planopilaris'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FFA is characterized by progressive, band-like frontotemporal hair loss that results in the appearance of a receding frontal hairline (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90010\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90010 \">picture 2</a>). Often, a few spared hairs can be found within the area of alopecia (&quot;lonely hair sign&quot;). Eyebrow involvement is common. Patients may also exhibit hair loss in the axillary, pubic, beard, or limb areas. (See <a href=\"#H692730\" class=\"local\">'Frontal fibrosing alopecia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GLPLS is a rare variant of LPP that is defined by the presence of three features. Patients exhibit cicatricial alopecia of the scalp, noncicatricial alopecia involving axillary and pubic hair, and a lichenoid follicular eruption. (See <a href=\"#H692737\" class=\"local\">'Graham-Little-Piccardi-Lasseur syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical course of LPP is unpredictable. The condition may stabilize or continue to slowly progress over time. (See <a href=\"#H3968170\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of LPP is based upon the clinical examination and biopsy results (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90012\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90012 \">picture 3</a>). A biopsy should always be performed to confirm a diagnosis of LPP. Proper selection of the biopsy site is crucial. (See <a href=\"#H27065853\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a paucity of high-quality data on treatments for LPP resulting in uncertainty about the best approach to patient management. For patients with active, slowly progressing classic LPP, we suggest topical or intralesional corticosteroid therapy as initial treatment based upon limited data that suggest efficacy in some patients and the relative safety of these therapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10619430\" class=\"local\">'First-line therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We treat classic LPP patients who fail to respond to local corticosteroid therapy or who present with rapidly progressing disease or extensive disease with systemic therapy. Commonly used treatments include systemic glucocorticoids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>. Patients with disease that is refractory to these treatments may benefit from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil. Additional studies will be useful for confirming the efficacy of these and other systemic agents.
