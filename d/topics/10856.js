Baseline genotype samples were obtained from over 17,000 women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study and more than 11 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were evaluated for the presence or absence of vasomotor symptoms. A number of SNPs on chromosome&nbsp;4 were found to be associated with vasomotor symptoms; all were on <em>TACR3</em>, which is implicated in the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Neurokinin B (NKB) (a hypothalamic neuropeptide) and its receptor (NK3R) are also thought to be associated with vasomotor symptoms as <em>TACR3</em> is the gene that encodes NK3R, and peripheral infusion of NKB induces hot flashes in postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hot-flashes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Among 1449 women with VMS, the median total VMS duration was 7.4 years, with symptoms persisting for a median of 4.5 years after the FMP. Women who were premenopausal or early perimenopausal when they first experienced VMS had the longest total duration (&gt;11.8 years, post-FMP median duration 9.4 years). When compared with other <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> groups, African American women had the longest total VMS duration (10.1 years), while Chinese and Hispanic women had the shortest (approximately five years). The different trajectories of menopausal symptoms are described above (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F114375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114375 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H73748280\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence and natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>The long duration of hot flashes raises treatment challenges for many women as current guidelines recommend menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) for as short a duration as possible (typically no more than four to five years to avoid excess breast cancer risk). Therefore, many women will continue to be symptomatic after their MHT is discontinued. (See <a href=\"#H299306331\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hot flashes are mediated by thermoregulatory dysfunction at the level of the hypothalamus and are induced by estrogen withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hot-flashes/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The thermoneutral zone is narrowed in women with hot flashes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hot-flashes/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. While premenopausal women initiate mechanisms to dissipate heat when the core body temperature increases by 0.4&deg;C, this happens with much lower increases in temperature in menopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hot-flashes/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The feeling of warmth results from inappropriate peripheral vasodilatation with increased digital and cutaneous blood flow. Perspiration results in rapid heat loss and a decrease in core body temperature below normal. Shivering may then occur as a normal mechanism to restore the core temperature to normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hot-flashes/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Estrogen administration restores the &quot;thermoneutral zone&quot; to normal and largely abolishes hot flashes.</p><p>The observation that prepubertal girls, whose endogenous estrogen levels are very low, do not experience hot flashes provides evidence that hypoestrogenemia alone is not adequate for hot flashes to occur. Data from patients with Turner syndrome and functional hypothalamic amenorrhea suggest that exposure to adult levels of estrogen followed by withdrawal are necessary for hot flashes to occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations#H627673082\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Evidence for central mediation of the changes in temperature comes from studies demonstrating that hot flashes occur simultaneously with, but are not caused by, pulses of luteinizing hormone (LH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hot-flashes/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. The close proximity of the medial preoptic area (the major thermoregulatory area in mammals) and a high density of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-containing neurons suggest the possibility of simultaneous activation of a burst of GnRH release and thermoregulatory changes.</p><p>One hypothesis, supported by indirect evidence, suggests that KNDy (kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin) neurons mediate the LH and thermoregulatory changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hot-flashes/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1050069\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H664567154\"><span class=\"h2\">Typical symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hot flashes typically begin as the sudden sensation of heat centered on the upper chest and face that rapidly becomes generalized. The sensation of heat often lasts from two to four minutes, is often associated with profuse perspiration and occasionally palpitations, and is sometimes followed by chills, shivering, and a feeling of anxiety. Hot flashes may range from an average of less than one each day to as many as one per hour during the day and night.</p><p>Hot flashes have a negative impact on quality of life as well as an association with adverse health indicators (increased cardiovascular risk and greater bone <span class=\"nowrap\">loss/increased</span> bone turnover) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hot-flashes/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>Although several grading scales have been reported, a practical classification of hot flashes and nights sweats utilizes a four-point scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hot-flashes/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(1) Not present</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(2) Mild &ndash; Do not interfere with usual activities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(3) Moderate &ndash; Interfere somewhat with usual activities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(4) Severe &ndash; So bothersome that usual activities cannot be performed</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H664567160\"><span class=\"h3\">Other causes of sweating</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other causes of sweating may mimic hot flashes or night sweats, including the carcinoid syndrome, medications, hyperthyroidism, infection, and malignancy, all of which are reviewed in detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56351\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56351 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58031\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58031 \">table 3</a>).

In one study of 34 symptomatic perimenopausal women undergoing one to five overnight polysomnographic (PSG) recordings, 69 percent of hot flashes were associated with awakening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hot-flashes/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Hot flashes, although not the only cause of sleep disturbance, accounted for 27 percent of wakefulness during the night in these women.

Instead, simple behavioral measures, such as lowering room temperature, using fans, dressing in layers of clothing that can be easily shed, and avoiding triggers (such as spicy foods and stressful situations), can help reduce the number of hot flashes. The concept of the narrowing of the thermoregulatory zone, described above, explains why reducing the layers of clothing may reduce the severity of hot flashes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/menopausal-hot-flashes/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

However, several expert societies, including the Endocrine Society, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the North American Menopause Society, and the International Menopause Society no longer recommend a specific duration of treatment in symptomatic women, based upon revised safety data and the observation that hot flashes persist well beyond five years in many women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F114375\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114375 \">figure 2</a>).

However, only approximately 20 to 30 percent of women seek medical attention for treatment. (See <a href=\"#H73748280\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence and natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than 80 percent of women who have hot flashes will continue to have them for more than one year. When untreated, hot flashes diminish and then cease spontaneously within a few years of onset in most women but may persist in others. Specifically, hot flashes continue in 12 to 15 percent of women in their sixties and 9 percent after age 70 years. (See <a href=\"#H370160229\" class=\"local\">'Duration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hot flashes typically begin as the sudden sensation of heat centered on the upper chest and face that rapidly becomes generalized. The sensation of heat lasts from two to four minutes, is often associated with profuse perspiration and occasionally palpitations, and is sometimes followed by chills, shivering, and a feeling of anxiety. Hot flashes may range from an average of less than one each day to as many as one per hour during the day and night. (See <a href=\"#H664567154\" class=\"local\">'Typical symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When hot flashes occur at night, women typically describe them as &quot;night sweats.&quot; VMS at night can cause significant sleep disturbances in many women. (See <a href=\"#H17657079\" class=\"local\">'Effect on sleep'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postmenopausal women with mild hot flashes usually do not seek or require pharmacologic intervention. Simple lifestyle changes such as keeping the core body temperature cool are often adequate to manage symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H706386420\" class=\"local\">'Women with mild hot flashes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For postmenopausal women with moderate to severe VMS (and no history of breast cancer or cardiovascular disease nor moderate to high risk of these diseases), we suggest low-dose estrogen plus progestin therapy (or estrogen alone if no uterus) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Additional information on menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT), including its risks and benefits, potential candidates for therapy, as well as information on dose, regimens, and duration of therapy are discussed in detail separately.

We typically use a single bedtime dose of gabapentin (300 mg, or as low as 100 mg if needed, titrating up to 900 mg until symptom relief or side effects), which takes advantage of the sedating effect of gabapentin while minimizing daytime sedation.
