The cellular content of insulin receptors is variable, with the highest level of expression in cells that are most responsive to insulin for glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism, especially adipose, skeletal muscle, and liver. Initially identified over 25 years ago [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], the insulin receptor cDNA was cloned in 1985 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Crystal structures of its protein tyrosine and of its extracellular domains were determined in 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], respectively. Since insulin has profound importance in metabolic control, studies of its receptor protein have been the subject of intense investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EXPRESSION AND SUBUNIT STRUCTURE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Receptor gene and mRNA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The insulin receptor gene maps to human chromosome 19 and spans more than 150 kilobases (kb) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The 22 exons of the receptor gene are transcribed into several mRNA species ranging from 4.2 to 9.5 kb in length due to variation in their 3'-untranslated regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Exon 11, which encodes a 12 amino acid segment localized to the C-terminus of the &alpha;-subunit, is subject to tissue-specific alternative splicing in a pattern conserved between humans and lower mammals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72096\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72096 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>The abundance of receptor mRNA and protein are up-regulated by differentiation of adipocyte and muscle precursor cells as they acquire an insulin-sensitive phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In some cells, exposure to insulin reduces receptor mRNA abundance, which may play a role in regulation of receptor number in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In rare cases of severe insulin resistance due to mutations in the receptor gene, extreme reduction in receptor abundance has been shown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, altered receptor abundance is not believed to play a major role in common forms of insulin resistance in obesity or type 2 diabetes.</p><p>The primary translation product of the insulin receptor mRNA is a linear &alpha;-&szlig; sequence of the insulin receptor precursor (proreceptor). The signal sequence of 27 hydrophobic amino acids at the N-terminus of the &alpha;-subunit allows the receptor to enter the endoplasmic reticulum, during which process the signal peptide is cleaved. The proreceptor is further proteolytically-processed by furin in the Golgi apparatus into distinct &alpha; and &szlig;-subunits at a cleavage site consisting of four basic amino acids (Arg-Lys-Arg-Arg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>], apparently after disulfide linkage of two proreceptor molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Receptor structure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The receptor is composed of two extracellular &alpha;-subunits that are each linked to a &szlig;-subunit and to each other by disulfide bonds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F58299\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58299 \">figure 2</a>). Reduction of the bonds that link the &alpha;-subunits produces an &alpha;-&szlig; monomer that binds insulin with reduced affinity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>] and that is devoid of insulin stimulated tyrosine kinase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Reconstitution of such hetero-dimers into hetero-tetramers restores both high affinity insulin binding and insulin stimulated kinase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mature &alpha;-subunit contains either 719 or 731 amino acids (due to alternative mRNA splicing of exon 11, as indicated above) and has a molecular mass of approximately 130 kDa. The amino acid numbering system for the insulin receptor typically refers to the form that includes the 12 additional amino acids encoded by exon 11 in the &alpha;-subunit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The &alpha;-subunit is entirely extracellular, and contains the binding sites for insulin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The transmembrane-spanning &szlig;-subunit contains 620 amino acids and has an approximate molecular mass of 95 kDa. The &szlig;-subunit has three components: extracellular, transmembrane, and cytosolic. The cytosolic component contains the receptor's tyrosine kinase catalytic activity that is regulated by insulin, and is very structurally homologous to other members of the tyrosine protein kinase family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The cytosolic component of the &szlig;-subunit has several sub-domains: a juxtamembrane domain; the tyrosine kinase catalytic domain, which contains an ATP binding site and an &ldquo;activation loop&rdquo; with three closely spaced tyrosines that become phosphorylated; and a carboxy-terminal domain.</p><p/><p>Both receptor-subunits are glycosylated during the process of translation and contain complex N-linked carbohydrate side chains with terminal sialic acid residues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], which are necessary for normal folding and hence function of the receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The extracellular component of the &beta;-subunit also contains O-linked oligosaccharides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p> Elucidation of the crystal structure of recombinant receptor ecto-domain and its subsequent refinement revealed that it has a unique structure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82549\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82549 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The N-terminus is composed of two globular leucine-rich repeat domains, L1 and L2, flanking the cysteine-rich domain, which is formed from eight modular cystine linked repeats. The C-terminus is formed from three Type III fibronectin repeat domains (FnIII 1, -2, and -3), a common structural motif in the extracellular domains of membrane proteins. The first of these is located in the &alpha;-subunit and the third is located in the &beta;-subunit. The second domain is atypical containing a disordered 120 amino acid insertion, the Insert Domain, which contains the &alpha;-&beta; cleavage site. These are folded into an inverted V, with the apex of the V being formed from the L2 and the first Type III fibronectin repeat domains.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Insulin receptor isoforms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although it is encoded by a single gene, the alternative pre-mRNA splicing of exon 11 in the insulin receptor transcript generates two isoforms, one with exon 11 (HIR-B or EX11+) and one without exon 11 (HIR-A or EX11-). Thus, the protein forms differ by the presence or absence, respectively, of the 12 amino acids at the carboxy-terminus of the &alpha;-subunit encoded by exon 11 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72096\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72096 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Interestingly, the relative abundance of the two alternatively spliced mRNAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>] and their encoded proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] is tissue-specific and developmentally regulated. The smaller EX11- form predominates in hematopoietic cells and the larger EX11+ form predominates in liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Differences in isoform function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The conservation of the exon 11 mRNA splicing in different species suggests the possibility that the two receptor forms have functionally distinct properties; in spite of intensive studies, the functional differences identified have been of small magnitude. The Ex 11-form is agreed to display a one and a half- to twofold higher affinity for insulin and may exhibit accelerated internalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. Whether the two forms differ with respect to kinase activity is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of isoforms in disease states</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of receptor splice forms in disease states is controversial. Different levels of expression in muscle from insulin resistant (90 percent &quot;B&quot; form) versus insulin sensitive individuals (81 percent) have been shown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Whether these changes alter level of the receptor isoforms or have biological consequences is presently unknown. In myotonic muscular dystrophy, which is associated with insulin resistance, a splicing defect results in all insulin receptors being of the A form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Impaired insulin stimulated glucose uptake by striated muscle has been demonstrated in a murine model of this disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">INSULIN BINDING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of the binding of insulin to the receptor have shown that binding kinetics are complex, due to heterogeneity of insulin binding sites, negative cooperativity in the binding function, or a combination of the two [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Further structural insights into the insulin-insulin receptor interaction have been gained from mutational analysis and crystallization data described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Negative cooperativity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kinetic experiments, in which insulin binding at high concentrations induces a low affinity state and increases the rate of hormone dissociation, support the existence of negative cooperativity of insulin binding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. It has been proposed that each &alpha;-subunit of the receptor dimer contains two distinct, non-identical insulin binding sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Thus, at low &quot;physiologic&quot; insulin concentrations, one molecule of insulin would simultaneously bind to both receptor monomers in an asymmetrical manner (using nonidentical binding sites), giving a stoichiometry of one for the holoreceptor at &quot;physiologic&quot; conditions. The two-site binding would account for the binding being of high affinity. As it is further posited that only one two-site binding event can occur, binding of a second molecule of insulin, in the presence of higher (nonphysiologic) levels of insulin, would result in a conformational change leading to disruption of two-site binding of the first molecule of insulin, thereby reducing binding affinity and potentially accounting for negative cooperativity. Experimental studies of insulin binding to &alpha;-&szlig; heterodimers confirms the prediction that insulin binding to this species occurs as a single class of low affinity sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/21,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Binding site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The location of the binding site(s) in the &alpha;-subunit was initially inferred from the fact that this subunit is entirely extracellular; it is also the only subunit ever identified in affinity labeling protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. Mutational analysis, including alanine-scanning mutagenesis, experiments with recombinant mini-receptors, and reconstitution studies provide evidence that a major insulin binding site, Site 1, is formed from elements of the L1 domain amino acids 704 to 717 and in the Insert Domain at the C-terminus of the &alpha;-subunit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/46-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-52</a>]. Complementation studies with truncated secreted receptors and affinity labeling studies suggest that the L1 component and Insert Domain components are contributed by separate receptor monomers. Re-interpretation of the insulin receptor electron density maps of the insulin extra-cellular domain combined with photo-affinity labeling studies provide structural confirmation of this domain organization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. This study also confirmed the &alpha;-helical structure of the fragment of the C-terminus of the &alpha;-subunit of the receptor critical for insulin binding (amino acids 693 to 710), which is in contact with the large &beta;-sheet of the receptor L1 domain from the other receptor monomer; the C-terminus of the &alpha;-subunit is proximal to the N-terminus of L1. The hydrophobic surface of this &alpha;-helix (Phe 705, Tyr 708, and Leu 709) docks in a pocket formed from hydrophobic residues of the L1 &beta;-sheet (Leu 36, Leu 37, Leu 62, Phe 64, Phe 88, Phe 89, Tyr 91, Val 94, and Phe 96).</p><p>Low resolution structures of complexes of insulin and receptor fragments, representing Site 1 interactions, have been obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The models derived from these crystal structures provide detailed insights into the mechanism of insulin binding to Site 1 that are confirmed by biochemical studies in the holo-receptor, although the N- and C-termini of B-chain are not resolved. The major receptor residues that interact with insulin are His 710, Asn 711, and Phe 714. These contact the N-terminal residues of the insulin A-chain a-helix (A1 to A3 and A19) and residues in the B-chain &alpha;-helix (B7 to B9, B12, and B15). There is limited contact between receptor L1 domain residues and insulin. It is likely that the majority of insulin-binding hot spots identified by mutational analysis in this domain exert their effects indirectly. When compared with the apo-receptor structure, the &alpha;-subunit &alpha;-helical fragment of the C-terminus of the receptor is extended C-terminally to include amino acids 711 to 715. It is also displaced; it engages a non-polar groove in the L1 &beta;-sheet (Leu 36, Leu 27, Leu 62, and Phe 64). It is located in volume that is normally occupied by the C-terminus of the insulin B-chain (B26 to 30) in the structure of the free hormone confirming that receptor-induced displacement of these residues is a necessary step for the formation of a high affinity insulin-receptor complex. This structural model is consistent with the biochemical literature characterizing insulin and insulin receptor structure and function.</p><p>A second insulin binding site, Site 2 with lower affinity, is formed from residues in the first and second Type III fibronectin repeats and the linker between them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. The crystal structure shows that the Site 1 of one monomer is close enough to Site 2 of the second monomer to permit simultaneous binding of one molecule of insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Complementation studies with reconstituted mutant holoreceptor confirm this and also show that this is essential for the generation of high affinity interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. This bivalent binding mechanism is consistent with negative cooperativity as described above and with biochemical findings that the holoreceptor only binds one molecule of insulin with high affinity at physiological insulin concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">INSULIN RECEPTOR-SUBUNIT INTERACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The binding of insulin to the receptor causes rapid receptor autophosphorylation on specific tyrosine side-chains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/45,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,58</a>], an event that appears to be critical to both activation of the tyrosine kinase towards exogenous substrates and most or all of the actions of insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The insulin mediated cross-linking of the receptor described above provides an attractive mechanism for receptor activation. The cross-linking of the two receptor monomers may potentially stabilize them in a conformation that facilitates the trans-phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase catalytic domains that is essential for activation of their catalytic activity. The structural details of this process remain obscure.</p><p>The extracellular domain crystal structure and molecular dynamic simulations suggest that the insulin-binding sites undergo see-saw movements, which lead to their opening and closing with consequent changes in the topology of the two monomers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/29,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,59</a>]. Binding of insulin stabilizes one binding site in the &ldquo;closed&rdquo; active conformation. This is accompanied by the opening of the second site to allow access of a second molecule of insulin. Receptor cross-linking by the second molecule of insulin reverses the conformational changes with dissociation of the first insulin molecule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Analyses of crystal structures of the insulin-insulin receptor complexes will be needed to further illuminate the mechanism of insulin binding.</p><p>An additional or alternative mechanism of receptor activation is suggested by the observation of the displacement of the C-terminal &alpha;-helical fragment of the receptor &alpha;-subunit during the process of insulin binding discussed above. Mutations in this region either compromise insulin stimulated receptor tyrosine kinase activation disproportionately to their effect on insulin binding, or selectively impair this process without effect on binding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>It thus appears that insulin binding initiates a complex choreography of conformational changes in the insulin receptor extra-cellular domain dimer, whose structural details remain to be determined, that are transmitted across the cellular membrane to the intra-cellular domain.</p><p>How these conformational changes are transmitted to the transmembrane domains, and hence to the intracellular domains of the receptor, is not well understood. Numerous substitution and deletion mutations introduced into the transmembrane domain fail to alter receptor processing, binding, kinase activity, or ability to activate downstream pathways, suggesting a &quot;passive role&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. However, certain substitutions can activate the receptor kinase, suggesting that this domain is able to influence the conformation or orientation of the kinase domain(s) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. This latter concept is supported by the findings of a report which showed that a peptide with the sequence of the insulin receptor transmembrane domain is a receptor agonist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. This property is specific, as peptides with sequences derived from the transmembrane domains of other tyrosine kinase receptors, including the homologous insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor, are without significant effect on insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity. These data may be interpreted as suggesting that, in the basal state, the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase domains are in an inactive dimeric confirmation stabilized by transmembrane domain interactions. Interactions with the peptide disrupt this interaction and facilitate transition to the active dimeric conformation.</p><p>In contrast, a study of the structurally homologous IGF-I receptor provides compelling evidence that in the unliganded receptor the extracellular domain serves to prevent dimerization of the transmembrane domains and hence dimerization and activation of the tyrosine kinase catalytic domains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. This is consistent with the longstanding observation that tryptic digestion of the insulin receptor extracellular domain activates its tyrosine kinase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Ligand binding relieves this constraint. On the basis of the comparison of crystal structures of complexes of insulin with various receptor fragments with that of the unliganded receptor extra-cellular domain, it is possible that ligand binding produces a conformational change (rotation) of the L1 domain, disrupting its interaction with the FnIII-2 and &ndash;3 domains (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82549\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82549 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. This interaction stabilizes the separation of the C-termini of the extracellular domain dimer and its disruption thus facilitates dimerization of the transmembrane domains with the consequent approximation and autophosphorylation of the receptor intracellular domains. While plausible on the basis of the published structures, there is little direct experimental evidence that this conformational change occurs in the intact receptor in response to ligand binding.</p><p>A definitive, detailed description of the mechanism of insulin mediated receptor activation will require high resolution structures of the insulin holo-receptor in the presence or absence of insulin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF KINASE DOMAIN REGULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The crystal structure of the tyrosine kinase domain of the human insulin receptor has provided unique insight into the regulation of the insulin receptor enzyme activity and mechanism of autophosphorylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. One group analyzed a 306 amino acid fragment of the &szlig; chain of the human insulin receptor, which contains the tri-tyrosine sites whose autophosphorylation is required for receptor kinase activity towards exogenous substrates. This fragment becomes an active tyrosine kinase when auto-phosphorylated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/structure-and-function-of-the-insulin-receptor/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>Crystallization data revealed a novel auto-inhibitory mechanism. Tyr-1162, one of the tri-tyrosines in the kinase domain that becomes phosphorylated early following insulin binding, occupies a space in the active site of the enzyme, seemingly poised for a cis-autophosphorylation event (phosphorylated by its own &szlig;-subunit). However, the hydroxyl group of the Tyr-1162 phenolic ring that is the target of phosphorylation is hydrogen bonded to the carboxylate group of the catalytic base of its own &szlig;-subunit (residue Asp-1132), rendering the binding pocket for ATP blocked in this state. Thus, in the unphosphorylated (basal) form of the receptor, the Tyr-1162 of each &szlig;-subunit sits in that &szlig;-subunit's substrate binding site and functions in a cis-autoinhibition mechanism.</p><p>When insulin binds to the &alpha;-subunit, the quaternary structure of the &szlig;-subunit undergoes a conformational change, moving Tyr-1162 out of the receptor kinase domain catalytic pocket. As a result, the phosphorylation sites (in the tri-tyrosine domain) of one &szlig; chain come within reach of the active site of the other &szlig; chain. The movement of Tyr-1162 allows ATP to bind and a trans-phosphorylation event takes place involving the kinase activity of one &szlig;-subunit and the Tyr-1162 residue of the corresponding adjacent &szlig;-subunit in the receptor heterotetramer.
