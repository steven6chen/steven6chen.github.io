Most literature defines ER as being present on the ECG when there is J-point elevation of &ge;0.1 mV in two adjacent leads with either a slurred or notched morphology. Historically, ER has been considered a marker of good health because it is more prevalent in athletes, younger persons, and at slower heart rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-repolarization/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. However, numerous more recent reports have suggested an association between ER and an increased risk for arrhythmic death and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-repolarization/abstract/4-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-11</a>].</p><p>While some level of increased risk of sudden cardiac death has been reported in persons with ER, the relatively high prevalence of the ER pattern in the general population (5 to 13 percent) in comparison to the incidence of idiopathic VF (approximately 10 cases per 100,000 population) means that the ER pattern will nearly always be an incidental ECG finding with no clinical implications. However, a primary arrhythmic disorder such as idiopathic VF due to ER is far more likely when associated with syncope or resuscitated sudden cardiac death in the absence of other etiologies. (See <a href=\"#H24316877\" class=\"local\">'ER syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic will review the genetics, prevalence, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of ER and will present an approach to the management of patients with ER and idiopathic VF. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21542558\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definition of early repolarization (ER) on an electrocardiogram (ECG) is based on well-defined ECG findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F93392\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93392 \">table 1</a>). Although the 2013 <span class=\"nowrap\">HRS/EHRA/APHRS</span> presented a definition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F93392\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93392 \">table 1</a>), the 2016 AHA scientific Statement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-repolarization/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] highlights the lack of agreement across published studies pertaining to definition. A 2015 consensus document suggested reporting more detailed amplitudes of the J-wave including amplitudes corresponding to J-wave onset (Jo), J-wave peak (Jp), and J-wave termination (Jt), as well as durations D1 (Jo to Jp) and D2 (Jp to Jt), in relation to an end-QRS notch, and of Jp and Jt, as well as D2, in relation to an end-QRS slur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-repolarization/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The majority of publications at the present time merely adopt the amplitude of Jp as the reference point for measuring J-point elevation. The ST-segment should be regarded as horizontal or downward sloping if the amplitude of the ST-segment 100 ms after Jt (interval M) is less than or equal to the amplitude at Jt. The ST-segment should be regarded as upward sloping if the amplitude of the ST-segment 100 ms after Jt (interval M) is greater than the amplitude at Jt. However, duration measurements K, L, and M, each 100 ms, from Jo, Jp and Jt could be used in the measurement of the ST slope in the presence of a notch or duration measurements L or M, each 100 ms, used in the presence of an end-QRS slur with onset from Jp or Jt to measure slope, respectively. &#160;</p><p><br/> </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21543526\"><span class=\"h2\">ECG findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On the ECG, ER is defined as either:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sharp well-defined positive deflection or notch immediately following a positive QRS complex at the onset of the ST segment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of slurring at the terminal part of the QRS complex (since the J-wave or J-point elevation may be hidden in the terminal part of the QRS complex, resulting in the slurring of the terminal QRS complex) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F83883\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef83883 \">waveform 1</a>).</p><p/><p>Most literature defines ER as being present on the ECG when there is J-point elevation of &ge;0.1 mV in two adjacent leads with either a slurred or notched morphology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-repolarization/abstract/4,5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,12</a>]. &#160; The AHA scientific statement proposed the use of ER qualified with descriptive terms such as with ST-segment elevation, the magnitude, ER with terminal <span class=\"nowrap\">slur/notch</span> and also noting the distribution on the ECG and any concomitant ECG findings (eg, J-wave augmentation or short coupled ventricular ectopy).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21543262\"><span class=\"h2\">ECG classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on data associating arrhythmic risk with spatial distribution of ER, a classification scheme has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/early-repolarization/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>] (see <a href=\"#H4191980\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis of ER pattern'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 1 is associated with ER in the lateral precordial leads.

Patients with idiopathic VF who had ER were also more likely to experience syncope or cardiac arrest during sleep than were those without ER. During a mean follow-up of 61 &plusmn; 50 months, ICD monitoring showed a higher incidence of recurrent VF in case subjects with ER than in those without (hazard ratio, 2.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 3.5).<strong> </strong></p><p/><p>Even though ER is fairly common in the general population, idiopathic VF is rare.

Most literature defines ER as being present on the electrocardiogram (ECG) when there is J-point elevation of &ge;0.1 mV in two adjacent leads with either a slurred or notched morphology. (See <a href=\"#H21543526\" class=\"local\">'ECG findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ER is an ECG finding. Two terms, distinguished by the presence or absence of symptomatic arrhythmias, have been used to describe patients with this ECG finding (see <a href=\"#H21543506\" class=\"local\">'ER pattern versus ER syndrome'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The <strong>ER pattern</strong> describes the patient with appropriate ECG findings in the absence of symptomatic arrhythmias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The <strong>ER syndrome</strong> applies to the patient with both appropriate ECG findings and symptomatic arrhythmias.<br/><br/>Persons with either the ER pattern or ER syndrome can have identical findings on surface ECG. However, the mere presence of ER pattern on ECG should not lead to a classification of ER syndrome in the absence of symptoms or documented ventricular fibrillation (VF).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several population studies have estimated that the prevalence of ER ranges from 5 to 13 percent of persons. The perception that ER was a benign finding devoid of clinical significance has changed, with numerous studies suggesting a two- to threefold increased risk of death in those with ER versus those without ER. While ER appears to increase one's risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), the absolute risk of SCD remains exceedingly low in otherwise healthy people. Therefore the incidental identification of ER should not be interpreted as a high-risk marker for arrhythmic death due to the relatively low odds of SCD based on ER alone. (See <a href=\"#H21543845\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21543852\" class=\"local\">'Arrhythmic risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The genetic basis of ER continues to be elucidated, with the evidence restricted to either case reports or preliminary studies that fall short of clearly identifying the genetic basis of ER. Both gain of function and loss of function mutations in various ion channels have been reported in persons with ER. (See <a href=\"#H24315026\" class=\"local\">'Genetic basis and inheritance of ER'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The exact mechanism for ER is still unknown, and the precise mechanism for ER related idiopathic VF is also unknown. However, fundamentally, the purported mechanisms of ER and idiopathic VF all reflect an imbalance in the ion channel currents responsible for the terminal portion of depolarization and the early portion of repolarization. (See <a href=\"#H24316804\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of ER and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given its relatively high prevalence in the general population in comparison to the incidence of idiopathic VF, the ER pattern is almost always an incidental ECG finding. The diagnosis of ER syndrome, however, should be considered in a survivor of sudden cardiac death (SCD) with ECG evidence of ER and VF and an apparently structurally normal heart following extensive testing.
