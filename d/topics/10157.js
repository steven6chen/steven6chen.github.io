It is possible for women with lupus to have healthy pregnancies. But women who have lupus are more likely to have problems during pregnancy than women who don't.</p><p>If you have lupus, work closely with your doctors before and during pregnancy to reduce the chance of problems. You should not try to get pregnant until your lupus has been under control for at least 6 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102064610\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do before trying to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is very important to talk to your doctors <strong>before</strong> trying to get pregnant. You will need to see an obstetrician (a doctor who takes care of pregnant women), your rheumatologist (the doctor who handles your lupus), and your primary care doctor.</p><p>Your doctors can make sure that any medicines you take are safe to use during pregnancy. They will also do some tests to make sure your lupus is under control and that you don't have any medical problems that might affect you or the baby during pregnancy.</p><p>Some lupus medicines are very dangerous for a developing baby and can cause serious problems, including birth defects. If you take any of these medicines, you will need to work with your doctor to stop them before getting pregnant:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Mycophenolate</a> mofetil (brand names: CellCept, Myfortic) &ndash; You should stop this medicine, or switch to another medicine that is safe during pregnancy, at least <strong>6 months</strong> before trying to get pregnant. This is so your doctor can make sure your lupus is under control.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Cyclophosphamide</a> (sample brand name: Cytoxan) &ndash; You should stop this medicine, or switch to another medicine that is safe during pregnancy, at least <strong>6 months</strong> before trying to get pregnant. This is so your doctor can make sure your lupus is under control.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Methotrexate</a> (sample brand names: Rheumatrex, Trexall) &ndash; Stop at least <strong>1 month (3 months is even better)</strong> before trying to get pregnant.</p><p/><p>If you do get pregnant while taking any of these medicines, tell your doctors right away. Your doctors will help you decide whether to stop (or switch) any other medicines you are taking. They might recommend tests to make sure your baby is developing normally.</p><p>There are also steps that <strong>all</strong> women should take before trying to get pregnant.

Women with preeclampsia have high blood pressure and too much protein in their urine. The condition can cause problems with the baby's growth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giving birth to a &quot;premature&quot; baby (the baby is born before 37 weeks of pregnancy)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a baby that is smaller than normal</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fetus dying after 10 weeks of pregnancy (a &quot;fetus&quot; is what a baby is called before it is born)</p><p/><p>Having lupus can increase your baby's risk of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a disease called &quot;neonatal lupus&quot; &ndash; This can sometimes happen when the mother has a certain type of antibodies (proteins in the blood). Not everyone with lupus has these antibodies. Your doctor can test your blood for them. Sometimes, neonatal lupus can cause the baby to have heart problems, although this is uncommon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having learning disabilities &ndash; There are some studies that show that children of mothers with lupus have a slightly higher risk of learning disabilities.</p><p/><p>You can reduce the risk of problems during pregnancy by seeing your doctors often and letting them know if you think anything is wrong. Your doctors will do tests throughout your pregnancy to check for any problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102064624\"><span class=\"h1\">How will my medicines affect my pregnancy or my baby?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some lupus medicines can hurt an unborn baby.</p><p>Other medicines are safe to take during pregnancy if needed, but only at certain times or in certain amounts:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NSAIDs &ndash; NSAIDs include medicines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>. They can safely be used at some times in pregnancy, but not at other times.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroids &ndash; These medicines, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">prednisone</a>, are fairly safe in low doses during pregnancy. (These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.)</p><p/><p>There are other safe medicines available, too. Your doctors can help you decide how best to treat your lupus symptoms without hurting your baby.</p><p>Talk to your doctors about <strong>all</strong> the medicines you take and follow their directions carefully. Do not start taking any new medicines, supplements, or herbal drugs without first talking to your doctors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102064631\"><span class=\"h1\">Will pregnancy affect my lupus symptoms?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It might. Some women with lupus notice that their symptoms get worse during pregnancy. But it is not clear whether pregnancy actually causes symptoms to get worse. If your symptoms are not under control when you get pregnant, they will be more likely to get worse during your pregnancy.</p><p>Some normal pregnancy symptoms are similar to lupus symptoms. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling of the hands, feet, or ankles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numbness or pain in the hands</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Darkening of the skin on the face</p><p/><p>Some women with lupus notice that their symptoms get worse after they give birth. This is more likely in women who had symptoms when they got pregnant than in women whose symptoms were under control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102064639\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I be able to breastfeed?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Women with lupus can breastfeed. But they have to avoid certain medicines to breastfeed safely. That's because some lupus medicines can get into breast milk and harm a baby.</p><p>If you want to breastfeed, talk to your doctors. They can tell you which medicines you can take and which ones to avoid. Most of the medicines that aren't safe to take during pregnancy also aren't safe during breastfeeding. If you need these medicines to control your lupus, you might need to stop breastfeeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102064689\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lupus-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lupus (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-plan-and-prepare-for-a-healthy-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to plan and prepare for a healthy pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preeclampsia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-labor-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preterm labor (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deciding-to-breastfeed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Deciding to breastfeed (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-lupus-erythematosus-sle-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Preeclampsia (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preterm-labor-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Preterm labor (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
