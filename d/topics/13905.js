Many survivors experience impairment in cognition, mental health, and physical function, known as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). The mental health of family members may also be adversely affected, which is termed PICS-Family (PICS-F). &#160;</p><p>In this topic, we review the definition, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, evaluation, treatment, and outcome of PICS and PICS-F. The management and prognosis of patients following a cardiac arrest and of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and outcomes following sudden cardiac arrest in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5502439\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there is no official definition for post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), most clinicians agree that PICS constitutes new or worsening function in one or more of the following domains after critical illness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F95158\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95158 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-intensive-care-syndrome-pics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychiatric function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical function </p><p/><p>This definition is inclusive of adult patients who reside in long term acute care rehabilitation units, skilled nursing facilities, and at home. In addition, PICS, in general, excludes patients admitted with traumatic brain injury and stroke. PICS is usually identified in the immediate period following a critical illness. However, because symptoms are long lasting and the condition is under recognized, there is no set duration of time after a critical illness where PICS can or cannot occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-stroke-prognosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ischemic stroke prognosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The term post-intensive care syndrome-family (PICS-F) has been coined to encompass the effects of critical illness on acute and chronic psychological morbidity among patients' family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-intensive-care-syndrome-pics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is considered the family response to the stress of critical illness in a loved one. It includes the symptoms that are experienced by family members during the critical illness as well as those that occur following death or discharge of a loved one from the intensive care unit. (See <a href=\"#H101615485\" class=\"local\">'Post-intensive care syndrome-family'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5502445\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidemiology of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) is poorly studied. In the United States, among the 5.7 million annual admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU), approximately 4.8 million will survive the ICU stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-intensive-care-syndrome-pics/abstract/2-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-8</a>]. Although the exact prevalence of PICS among survivors is unknown, it is estimated that one-half or more will suffer from some component of PICS (cognitive, psychiatric, physical dysfunction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-intensive-care-syndrome-pics/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. The discussion in this section is limited to survivors of critical illness in general. The incidence of sequelae following acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-prognosis-and-outcomes-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Prognosis and outcomes in adults&quot;, section on 'Morbidity among survivors'</a>.)</p><p>Several studies have reported the incidence of cognitive, psychiatric, and physical dysfunction following critical illness:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive &ndash; Cognitive impairment after critical illness has been reported to occur on average in 25 percent of survivors with some studies reporting an incidence as high as 78 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-intensive-care-syndrome-pics/abstract/7,11-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11-21</a>]. The incidence of cognitive impairment was best illustrated by a prospective study of 821 patients that examined the long term cognitive effects of critical illness in patients admitted to medical or surgical ICUs with shock <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (the BRAIN-ICU Study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-intensive-care-syndrome-pics/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. While at baseline, 6 percent had cognitive impairment, at three months post discharge 40 percent had deficits that were similar to patients with moderate traumatic brain injury, and 26 percent had deficits that were similar to mild dementia. At 12 months post discharge, the deficits persisted for most patients. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychiatric &ndash; Psychiatric illnesses also appear to be common among survivors of critical illness, with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as the most common disorders reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-intensive-care-syndrome-pics/abstract/15,22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,22-26</a>]. The absolute risk varies between studies and ranges from 1 to 62 percent with high rates frequently reported in ARDS survivors. One national database registry of over 24,000 survivors of mechanical ventilation reported that 1 percent of patients had a new psychiatrist-diagnosed psychologic disorder (mostly anxiety and depression) while 19 percent received one or more prescriptions for psychoactive medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-intensive-care-syndrome-pics/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Systematic reviews of observational cohorts reported higher rates with the incidence of depressive and PTSD symptoms in critical illness survivors as 28 and 22 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-intensive-care-syndrome-pics/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. In survivors from the BRAIN-ICU study, 37 percent of patients experienced symptoms of depression, the rate appeared to be modified by pre-existing psychiatric disease, and the symptoms were largely the result of somatic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-intensive-care-syndrome-pics/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. An observational study reported an incidence of PTSD of 10 percent in ICU survivors at both 3 and 12 months post hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-intensive-care-syndrome-pics/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical &ndash; ICU-acquired weakness is the most common form of physical impairment occurring in 25 percent or more of ICU survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-intensive-care-syndrome-pics/abstract/8,9,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,29-31</a>]. One multicenter study reported that 64 percent of ICU survivors had problems with mobility at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-intensive-care-syndrome-pics/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, 73 percent reported moderate or severe pain. One quarter of patients reported themselves in need of care for more than 50 hours per week, the majority of which was provided by family members (80 percent). Consistent with these needs, 32 percent of patients from the BRAIN-ICU study were disabled in their activities of daily living at three months, 26 percent were disabled in instrumental activities of daily living, disability was prominent in those with and without pre-existing functional disability, and these disabilities persisted in most patients at 12 months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The clinical presentation, risk factors, and outcomes of neuromuscular weakness related to critical illness are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromuscular weakness related to critical illness&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p>The public health burden of PICS is likely substantial due to the presence of neuropsychological and functional disability that occurs in association with this syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-intensive-care-syndrome-pics/abstract/6,11,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,32</a>]. In a study of 293 patients that survived ICU admission, 44 percent required visitation by their community nurse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-intensive-care-syndrome-pics/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A negative impact on family income was reported by one-third to half of patients and families of survivors. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H258753806\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for the development of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) have not been clearly defined and vary depending on the component of PICS that is studied (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F95159\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95159 \">table 1</a>). Commonly cited risk factors can be broadly categorized into pre-existing factors (eg, neuromuscular disorders, dementia, psychiatric illness, comorbid conditions) and intensive care unit (ICU)-specific factors (eg, mechanical ventilation, acute delirium, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome). Whether ICU-related factors unmask pre-existing illness and to what degree critical illness accelerates pre-existing neuropsychological or functional decline is unclear, although some of this morbidity is likely also entirely new [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-intensive-care-syndrome-pics/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The relative contributions of specific critical illnesses (eg, sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, stroke, trauma), as opposed to general critical care (eg, frequent bedrest, excessive sedation, inadequate treatment of delirium or hospitalization), have not been addressed. In addition, it has been speculated that recurrent medicine disruptions play a role in the high rates of 90-day recurrent hospitalizations following discharge from the ICU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-intensive-care-syndrome-pics/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for the three domains of PICS are discussed below.

In a study of patients admitted for 14 days or more in the ICU, 34 percent of patients had a functionally significant contracture at ICU discharge, a limitation which persisted in the majority of these patients throughout the hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-intensive-care-syndrome-pics/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].

Although the relationship is unproven, malnutrition likely contributes to the subjective weakness reported by patients, as well as to the reduction in exercise capacity. In addition, patients who are extubated after prolonged mechanical ventilation have swallowing dysfunction further impairing their ability to eat, thereby committing the patient to enteral or parenteral nutrition.

In our practice we evaluate every survivor of critical illness for the cognitive, psychiatric, and physical signs and symptoms of PICS.

We prefer the MoCA for the evaluation of patients with suspected cognitive dysfunction following a critical illness.

Whether cognitive impairment identified using the MoCA at hospital discharge or shortly thereafter predicts long-term impairment is unknown. The evaluation of patients for cognitive impairment is discussed separately.

The management of PICS focuses on treating the individual impairments (cognitive, psychiatric, physical) with additional referral to appropriate health care personnel, when necessary.

In addition, it is known that light sedation practice with daily awakening reduces duration of mechanical ventilation, a risk factor for many of the components of PICS. Thus, although the effect of treating delirium or reducing mechanical ventilation days on the signs and symptoms of PICS is unknown, avoiding these risk factors, when feasible, is a reasonable strategy.

PICS-family (PICS-F) is the term used when critical illness of a loved one adversely affects the mental health of family members. (See <a href=\"#H5502439\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the exact prevalence of PICS among critical illness survivors is unknown, it is estimated that one-quarter to one-half or more will suffer from some component of PICS (cognitive, psychiatric, physical). (See <a href=\"#H5502445\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Commonly cited risk factors for the development of PICS are pre-existing illnesses including neuromuscular disorders, dementia, psychiatric illness, as well as intensive care unit (ICU)-specific factors, in particular, mechanical ventilation, delirium, sepsis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H258753806\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common presenting features of PICS include muscle weakness, poor mobility, poor concentration, poor memory, fatigue, anxiety, and depressed mood, which are typically corroborated by examination and formal testing. Although recovery is possible, many of the signs and symptoms of PICS last for months to years. (See <a href=\"#H5502452\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.) Increased health care utilization is very common, particularly in the first 90 days after discharge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every survivor of critical illness should undergo a thorough history and examination for the signs and symptoms of PICS. PICS is identified when new or worsening signs and symptoms are found in any one or more of the three affected domains following a critical illness: cognitive, psychiatric, and physical. The identification of each component should rely upon the elucidation of specific findings for each domain with confirmatory testing, when needed. (See <a href=\"#H258759330\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who are mechanically ventilated for more than 24 hours, we suggest strategies that promote light sedation and early rehabilitation to prevent PICS rather than usual care. The management of PICS focuses on treating the individual cognitive, psychiatric, and physical impairments with additional referral to appropriate health care personnel, when necessary. (See <a href=\"#H5502584\" class=\"local\">'Prevention and treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The signs and symptoms of PICS improve over the first 6 to 12 months following discharge from the intensive care unit. However, in many patients, deficits persist for years. PICS is frequently associated with the inability to return to work and decreased quality of life as well as an increased risk of death over the subsequent few years. (See <a href=\"#H405554472\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations of PICS-F include sleep deprivation, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. The psychological effects may persist for prolonged periods after discharge of the loved one from the intensive care unit. We advocate for good communication strategies between staff and family members of survivors of critical illness.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-intensive-care-syndrome-pics/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Needham DM, Davidson J, Cohen H, et al.
