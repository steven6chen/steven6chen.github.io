People who do not identify with 1 gender sometimes call themselves &quot;nonbinary&quot; or &quot;genderqueer.&quot;</p><p/><p>Transgender people might take medicines <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have surgery to change their bodies to better match their gender identities.</p><p>Transgender is not the same as homosexuality, which means a person is sexually attracted to people of the same sex. Transgender people can be attracted to people of the same sex, people of the opposite sex, or both.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91639121\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if I am transgender?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main thing transgender people feel is that their gender identity and expression (how they present themselves) do not match their recorded sex. Doctors sometimes use the term &quot;gender incongruence&quot; for this. They call it &quot;gender dysphoria&quot; when this feeling causes the person distress or discomfort.</p><p>Many transgender adults say they had these feelings as children, before they went through &quot;puberty.&quot; Puberty is the term for the changes the body goes through during the preteen and teen years.</p><p>If you think you might be transgender, a doctor, nurse, or therapist can help you understand what this means. It's a good idea to talk with a doctor or other professional who has experience working with transgender people. He or she can talk to you about your options and help you get the support you need.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1491370248\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I think my child might be transgender?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child shows signs of gender identity concerns, you can help by being accepting and supportive. Some children and young teens go through a time of identifying as the opposite sex but later are not transgender after all. Others are indeed transgender. Working with doctors (and others) who understand transgender issues can help both you and your child. It's important to keep in mind that being transgender is not a mental illness and that every person is different. For example, some children might want to dress like the opposite sex or change their name, while others do not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91639136\"><span class=\"h1\">When and how do transgender people get treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For some children, doctors prescribe medicines that stop puberty. This prevents sexual changes in children's bodies and gives them more time to figure out if they are truly transgender. <strong>Before</strong> puberty, children do not get any medicine. That's because many children who have gender identity concerns do not end up being transgender. Those who are transgender can usually start hormonal treatment around age 16. In some cases they can start earlier, if there is support from their team of doctors and other specialists. Most children should wait to have surgery until they are at least 18.</p><p>Treatment should involve doctors, nurses, and others who have experience working with transgender people. Types of treatment include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapy with a counselor (such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, nurse, or social worker) &ndash; Talking with a counselor can help you figure out what you want to do based on your gender identity. He or she might also put you in touch with other transgender people. This can help you get a better idea of what you might experience as your body changes with hormone treatment and with surgery (if you choose it).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social transition &ndash; A &quot;social transition&quot; means living as the gender you identify with, both at home and in public. This might include wearing clothes often associated with this gender, and using a name and pronouns (like &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot;) that fit with this gender. If you or your child wants to try a social transition, talk with a counselor or other expert. They can help you figure out when is the best time to try this.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; These include sex hormones and medicines that block sex hormones. Hormones are chemical messengers that turn on and off different processes in the body. Sex hormones cause changes in the sexual organs and other parts of the body. These medicines are taken as pills, injections (shots), or gels that you rub on your skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The male-to-female transition &ndash; During this process, transgender women take medicines that block male hormones (called &quot;androgens&quot;). Androgens are the hormones that cause hair to grow on the body and face. They also take female hormones (called &quot;estrogens&quot;). The 2 medicines help lessen body hair and make the body appear more feminine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The female-to-male transition &ndash; During this process, transgender men take androgens (testosterone). This usually stops their monthly periods. Androgens also cause hair to grow on the face and increase muscle. It also makes the &quot;clitoris&quot; grow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53704 \">figure 1</a>). The clitoris is the structure above the vagina that gives sexual pleasure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Not all transgender people choose to have surgery. But some do. Some people think the only surgery is for the genitals, which they might call &quot;sexual reassignment surgery.&quot; But there are actually several different surgery options. Many people prefer the terms &quot;gender confirmation surgeries&quot; or &quot;gender-affirming surgeries.&quot; Different people choose different surgeries based on what changes they want.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are 3 types of surgery that people might consider for the <strong>male-to-female</strong> transition:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Surgeries on the face and neck to create a more feminine appearance &ndash; Doctors call these &quot;facial feminization&quot; surgeries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Surgery to make the breasts larger</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Genital surgery &ndash; Doctors call this &quot;vaginoplasty.&quot; This includes creating a pouch that serves as a vagina. The surgeon uses the skin of the penis to line the inside of the new vagina, and the tip of the penis to serve as the clitoris. The surgeon removes the testicles and uses the skin of the scrotum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F68075\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68075 \">figure 2</a>) to create the folds of tissue around the vagina (called &quot;labia&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are 3 types of surgery that people might consider for the <strong>female-to-male</strong> transition:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Surgery to remove breast tissue and make the chest look more masculine</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Surgeries to remove the uterus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ovaries</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Genital surgery &ndash; Some people have surgery to make the clitoris longer (called &quot;metoidioplasty&quot;) or to create a penis (called &quot;phalloplasty&quot;). The surgeon may use tissue from the person's arm or leg to create a penis. He or she can also lengthen the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside the body (called the &quot;urethra&quot;). That way, the person can urinate standing up. The labia can be used to create a scrotum. Small plastic balls can be put inside the scrotum to make testicles.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91639151\"><span class=\"h1\">Can treatments for transgender people cause any medical problems?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hormones that transgender people take might make them slightly more likely to have certain medical conditions, including dangerous blood clots and heart disease. Experts say that transgender people who take hormones should see their doctor every 3 months for the first year of treatment, then 1 or 2 times a year after that. The doctor should test the person's hormone levels and check for any medical problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1506010758\"><span class=\"h1\">Can transgender people have children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hormone treatments transgender people get can affect their fertility. &quot;Fertility&quot; means the ability to get pregnant, or get a partner pregnant. If a person has surgery to remove the ovaries, uterus, or testicles, they will not be able to get pregnant or get a partner pregnant.</p><p>When deciding about treatment, it's important to think about whether you might want to have children in the future. You might have options. For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transgender men (whose recorded sex at birth was female) can try freezing their eggs before starting treatment. The eggs are stored until you choose to use them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transgender women (whose recorded sex at birth was male) can try &quot;sperm banking.&quot; This involves collecting sperm before you start treatment. The sperm are frozen and stored until you choose to use them.</p><p/><p>There are other ways to start a family, too. Some people choose to adopt a baby or child. Others use sperm or eggs that came from other people (called &quot;donor&quot; sperm or eggs).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91639168\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-sexual-development-puberty-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Normal sexual development (puberty) (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
