In a patient with an uncomplicated (simple) metabolic alkalosis, both parameters are above normal. However, this may not be present in patients with mixed acid-base disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and mixed acid-base disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis requires, sequentially, both the development or generation of alkalosis (related to the source of the additional bicarbonate) and the maintenance of the metabolic alkalosis (related to why the disorder persists and is not corrected by renal excretion of the excess bicarbonate). These issues are discussed in detail in other topics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-metabolic-alkalosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-metabolic-alkalosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of metabolic alkalosis&quot;</a>) but are briefly reviewed here:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An elevation in the serum bicarbonate concentration is due to excessive hydrogen ion loss in the urine or gastrointestinal tract; hydrogen ion movement into cells; administration of sodium or potassium bicarbonate or the sodium or potassium salt of an organic anion, such as citrate or lactate, that is metabolized and thereby generates bicarbonate; <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> volume contraction around a relatively constant amount of extracellular bicarbonate (called a contraction alkalosis). This is called the &quot;generation phase&quot; of metabolic alkalosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An inability to excrete the excess bicarbonate in the urine is due to intravascular volume contraction, reduced effective arterial blood volume (including heart failure and cirrhosis), chloride depletion, hypokalemia, renal impairment, or combinations of these factors. This is called the &quot;maintenance phase&quot; of metabolic alkalosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p/><p>Patients with metabolic alkalosis usually develop respiratory compensation characterized by hypoventilation and an elevation in arterial PCO2. This lowers the arterial pH toward normal. However, the beneficial pH effect of hypoventilation is blunted because the elevation in arterial PCO2 increases renal acid excretion, producing a further rise in serum bicarbonate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Symptoms can, for example, be due to volume depletion (which may produce lassitude, easy fatigability, muscle cramps, and postural dizziness) and hypokalemia (which may produce muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and, if persistent, polyuria and polydipsia due to impaired urinary concentrating ability <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> direct stimulation of thirst). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-volume-depletion-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of volume depletion in adults&quot;, section on 'Symptoms related to volume depletion'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults#H3819731\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of hypokalemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Manifestations of hypokalemia'</a>.)</p><p>Clinical manifestations directly related to the <strong>metabolic alkalosis</strong> are uncommon. This is in contrast to paresthesias, carpopedal spasm, and lightheadedness that often occur in acute <strong>respiratory</strong> <strong>alkalosis </strong>(see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperventilation-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperventilation syndrome&quot;</a>). This difference is probably related to several factors. Metabolic alkalosis probably causes a smaller change in intracellular pH and brain pH than acute respiratory alkalosis because rapid shifts in arterial CO2 tension are almost immediately transmitted throughout the total body water, including the intracellular fluid compartment, the brain, and the cerebrospinal fluid. By contrast, alterations in blood HCO3 concentration cause slower and less pronounced pH changes within the intracellular compartments and across the blood-brain barrier.</p><p>Muscular spasms, tetany, and paresthesia can occur with severe metabolic alkalosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>], but these findings are most likely to occur when the ionized calcium and magnesium concentrations are also reduced (as in Bartter syndrome, Gitelman syndrome, chronic diuretic use). Severe metabolic alkalosis can cause agitation, disorientation, seizures, and coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>], especially when metabolic alkalosis develops in patients with chronic liver disease. In such patients, the alkaline systemic pH will increase the concentration of unionized nitrogen compounds such as ammonia, which enhances their penetration into the central nervous system and thereby enhances neurotoxicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-treatment#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic encephalopathy in adults: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Commonly used treatments'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16729833\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormal findings on physical examination, when present, reflect the cause of the metabolic alkalosis. Hypovolemic patients (eg, vomiting, diuretic therapy for hypertension) may have signs of extracellular and intravascular volume depletion, such as reduced skin turgor, low-estimated jugular venous pressure, and postural hypotension. By contrast, patients with effective arterial blood volume depletion due to heart failure or cirrhosis who develop metabolic alkalosis (most often due to diuretic therapy) may have peripheral edema, ascites, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or,</span> in heart failure, pulmonary edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16729840\"><span class=\"h2\">Arterial blood gases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metabolic alkalosis is associated with a respiratory compensation that should raise the PCO2 by about 0.7 mmHg for every 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> elevation in the plasma bicarbonate concentration, thereby minimizing the increase in arterial pH. The respiratory compensation is most effective acutely and then becomes less effective over time. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders#H12584074\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and mixed acid-base disorders&quot;, section on 'Metabolic alkalosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders#H12584047\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and mixed acid-base disorders&quot;, section on 'Compensatory respiratory and renal responses'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16729847\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14887826\"><span class=\"h2\">The cause is usually apparent from the history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common causes of metabolic alkalosis are external loss of gastric secretions due to vomiting or nasogastric suction and diuretic therapy. These and other causes of metabolic alkalosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F85833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85833 \">table 1</a>) are often apparent from the history.

Several examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are unwilling or unable to report vomiting or diuretic ingestion. Self-induced vomiting and surreptitious diuretic or laxative abuse associated with the anorexia nervosa-bulimia nervosa spectrum are relatively common and must always be considered in patients with unexplained metabolic alkalosis, especially in women. Dental pathology (due to hydrochloric acid-induced decalcification), parotitis, and chronic traumatic lesions on the fingers and hands strongly suggest a diagnosis of surreptitious vomiting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bulimia-nervosa-and-binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-medical-complications-and-their-management#H1013501\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder in adults: Medical complications and their management&quot;, section on 'Dental'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bulimia-nervosa-and-binge-eating-disorder-in-adults-medical-complications-and-their-management#H338694\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder in adults: Medical complications and their management&quot;, section on 'Skin'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The history may not be helpful in patients with metabolic alkalosis due to primary mineralocorticoid excess syndromes (most often, primary aldosteronism), disorders that mimic mineralocorticoid excess including glycyrrhizic acid (licorice) ingestion, ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome, the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess, and genetic disorders involving renal tubular transport such as Bartter, Gitelman, or Liddle's syndrome. Primary aldosteronism and its mimics are usually associated with hypertension and mild volume expansion due to the stimulatory effect of aldosterone on sodium reabsorption, whereas patients with vomiting, diuretic therapy, Bartter syndrome, and Gitelman syndrome usually present with volume contraction and relatively low blood pressure.

However, certain conditions associated with diarrhea may produce a metabolic alkalosis:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Laxative abuse, which is often denied by the patient.

The cause is a mutation in the gene encoding the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger normally present in the colon and, to a lesser extent, the small intestine. This exchanger is also called solute carrier family 26, member 3 (SLC26A3); chloride diarrhea anion exchanger (CLD); and the downregulated-in-adenoma (DRA) transporter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-chronic-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-rich-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of chronic diarrhea in children in resource-rich countries&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-base-and-electrolyte-abnormalities-with-diarrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acid-base and electrolyte abnormalities with diarrhea&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The alkalosis in these conditions is in part related to relatively high stool chloride and potassium concentrations, resulting in potassium depletion and hypokalemia. The loss of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ammonium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ammonium chloride</a> and other organic chloride salts in the stool generates systemic bicarbonate. Hypokalemia stimulates the generation and excretion of ammonium chloride by the kidney, which generates systemic bicarbonate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/1,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9-11</a>]. In addition, hypokalemia causes potassium to move from the intracellular to the extracellular fluid, and this transcellular potassium flux moves extracellular hydrogen ions into cells to maintain electroneutrality. These ion fluxes simultaneously increase the plasma bicarbonate concentration but lower the intracellular pH. In renal tubular cells, this intracellular acidosis promotes hydrogen secretion into the lumen and, therefore, bicarbonate reabsorption and generation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F82488\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82488 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The pathophysiology of ion fluxes is discussed in detail separately.

This reflects the extracellular fluid volume contraction and chloride depletion that exist in these patients. In contrast, the urine sodium concentration often fluctuates in these patients. The hypovolemia stimulates renal tubule sodium reabsorption, reducing the urine sodium concentration. However, the urine sodium concentration may increase intermittently despite persistent volume contraction because the high serum bicarbonate concentration and high-filtered bicarbonate load will intermittently exceed the renal bicarbonate reabsorptive capacity. When this occurs, the loss of bicarbonate into the urine must be accompanied by an equimolar quantity of cations, mainly sodium and potassium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. At these times, the urine pH is high, generally greater than 6.5, and the urine sodium and potassium concentrations increase. However, the urine chloride concentration remains low. This is further described by the following sequence:</p><p>Gastric alkalosis is usually effectively treated with intravenous isotonic saline plus potassium infusion. When saline expands the extracellular volume, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> is excreted in the urine and the infused chloride is retained. The bicarbonate concentration falls and the chloride concentration increases. Restoration of the extracellular volume is signaled by a rise in the urine chloride concentration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16729883\"><span class=\"h4\">Diuretic-induced alkalosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diuretics that block sodium chloride reabsorption (thiazide and loop diuretics) produce a high<strong> </strong>urine chloride concentration when they are active. However, the urine chloride concentration falls to low levels when the diuretic effect has dissipated. Thus, patients who surreptitiously take diuretics will often have wide swings in the urine chloride concentration from day to day as the diuretic effect waxes and wanes. This finding in a patient with metabolic alkalosis is virtually diagnostic of diuretic use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16729890\"><span class=\"h4\">Other causes of metabolic alkalosis associated with low urine chloride concentration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The urine chloride can be low with other forms of metabolic alkalosis associated with extracellular fluid volume contraction and chloride depletion. As examples, the urine chloride is usually low when metabolic alkalosis develops in patients with laxative abuse, cystic fibrosis with excessive sweating (loss of a large volume of chloride-rich sweat) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], congenital chloride diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], and in infants given a chloride-deficient synthetic formula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16729897\"><span class=\"h3\">Settings in which the urine chloride is not low (greater than 25 mEq/L)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to the low urine chloride concentration in most patients with metabolic alkalosis who are hypovolemic, the urine chloride concentration is <strong>not</strong> low (greater than 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and often greater than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> when metabolic alkalosis exists in patients who are volume expanded due to the various forms of primary mineralocorticoid excess or a disorder that mimics mineralocorticoid excess.

(Bartter and Gitelman syndromes are the classic examples.) The mutations producing these disorders directly or indirectly reduce the activity of the sodium and chloride transporters that are inhibited by loop or thiazide diuretics. However, unlike diuretics, which are usually taken intermittently, these defects are persistent. Thus, they generate persistent renal salt wasting and a persistently high renal chloride concentration despite systemic volume contraction. Such patients are relatively hypovolemic and hypotensive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F85833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85833 \">table 1</a>).

It is believed that the severe potassium depletion can reversibly impair renal tubular chloride reabsorption, leading to a rise in urinary chloride excretion that is independent of volume status. This form of metabolic alkalosis does not improve with sodium chloride volume expansion but resolves with potassium repletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16729904\"><span class=\"h3\">Utility of urine chemistries in metabolic alkalosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usefulness of the urine chloride concentration was illustrated in a study that included 25 adult patients with unexplained metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia: The final diagnosis was diuretic abuse in 5, surreptitious vomiting in 8, and suspected Bartter or Gitelman syndrome in 12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

The pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis requires both the development and generation of alkalosis (related to the source of the additional bicarbonate) and the maintenance of the metabolic alkalosis (related to why the disorder persists and is not corrected by renal excretion of the excess bicarbonate) (see <a href=\"#H16729811\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An elevation in the serum bicarbonate concentration is due to hydrogen ion loss in the urine or gastrointestinal tract; hydrogen ion movement into cells; the administration of sodium or potassium bicarbonate or the sodium or potassium salt of an organic anion, such as citrate or lactate, that is metabolized and thereby generates bicarbonate; <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> volume contraction around a relatively constant amount of extracellular bicarbonate (called a contraction alkalosis). This is called the &quot;generation phase&quot; of metabolic alkalosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>An inability to excrete the excess bicarbonate in the urine is due to intravascular volume depletion, reduced effective arterial blood volume (including heart failure and cirrhosis), chloride depletion, hypokalemia, renal impairment, or combinations of these factors. This is called the &quot;maintenance phase&quot; of metabolic alkalosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with metabolic alkalosis may be asymptomatic or may complain of symptoms that are primarily related to either the underlying etiology of the alkalosis (eg, volume depletion) or accompanying electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypokalemia). Metabolic alkalosis due to Bartter or Gitelman syndrome or chronic diuretic use can be associated with neuromuscular irritability, spasms, and tetany. This may also occur with severe metabolic alkalosis of other etiologies. Abnormal findings on physical examination, when present, may reflect the cause of the metabolic alkalosis. (See <a href=\"#H16729818\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two most common causes of metabolic alkalosis are loss of gastric secretions due to vomiting or nasogastric suction and diuretic therapy. These and other causes of metabolic alkalosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F85833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85833 \">table 1</a>) are often apparent from the history. However, the etiology of metabolic alkalosis is not always apparent from the history. Several examples include (see <a href=\"#H16729855\" class=\"local\">'When the cause is not apparent from the history'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients who are unwilling or unable to report vomiting or diuretic ingestion such as those with self-induced vomiting and or surreptitious diuretic or laxative abuse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with metabolic alkalosis due to primary mineralocorticoid excess syndromes (most often, primary aldosteronism), disorders that mimic mineralocorticoid excess such as glycyrrhizic acid (licorice) ingestion, ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome, the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess, and genetic disorders involving renal tubular electrolyte transport such as Bartter, Gitelman, or Liddle's syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with certain causes of chloride-rich diarrhea, villous adenoma, and congenital chloridorrhea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the etiology of metabolic alkalosis is not apparent from the history and physical examination, measurement of the urine chloride, urine sodium, and urine pH can be helpful. (See <a href=\"#H16729862\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach in unexplained metabolic alkalosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spot urine chloride concentration is always appropriately low (less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and often below 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> when metabolic alkalosis is due to vomiting or nasogastric suction, reflecting hypovolemia, chloride depletion, and hypochloremia. Although the spot urine sodium concentration is also often reduced to less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> as a result of the volume depletion, it is less reliable than the urine chloride because it increases intermittently when bicarbonaturia occurs (and sodium and potassium are excreted to maintain electroneutrality). Under those conditions, the urine pH exceeds 7. However, the urine chloride concentration is persistently reduced whether or not bicarbonaturia exists, and it is therefore a superior indicator of volume status. (See <a href=\"#H16729876\" class=\"local\">'Vomiting or nasogastric suction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic alkalosis with a low urine chloride also occurs in patients who use diuretics (but only after the diuretic effect has dissipated). Thus, patients who surreptitiously take diuretics will often have wide swings in the urine chloride concentration as the diuretic effect waxes and wanes. This finding in a patient with metabolic alkalosis is virtually diagnostic of diuretic use. (See <a href=\"#H16729883\" class=\"local\">'Diuretic-induced alkalosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The urine chloride concentration may be low when metabolic alkalosis develops in patients with laxative abuse, cystic fibrosis with excessive sweating (loss of a large volume of chloride-rich sweat), congenital chloride diarrhea, and in infants given a chloride-deficient synthetic formula. (See <a href=\"#H16729890\" class=\"local\">'Other causes of metabolic alkalosis associated with low urine chloride concentration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast to the low urine chloride concentration in most patients with metabolic alkalosis who are hypovolemic, the urine chloride concentration is <strong>not</strong> low (it is usually greater than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> in patients who are taking loop or thiazide diuretics when the drug is still active and inhibiting renal tubule sodium and chloride reabsorption. Similarly, disorders resulting from genetic mutations that cause persistent renal salt wasting, such as Bartter or Gitelman syndrome, also result in elevated urine chloride concentration. These patients will be volume contracted and relatively hypotensive. They are functionally similar to persistently acting loop or thiazide diuretics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F85833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85833 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H16729897\" class=\"local\">'Settings in which the urine chloride is not low (greater than 25 mEq/L)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic alkalosis with a relatively high urine chloride concentration also occurs in patients with any form of primary mineralocorticoid excess or with the disorders that mimic mineralocorticoid excess (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F85833\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85833 \">table 1</a>). Under these conditions, the patients are generally volume expanded and hypertensive. (See <a href=\"#H16729897\" class=\"local\">'Settings in which the urine chloride is not low (greater than 25 mEq/L)'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Galla JH.
