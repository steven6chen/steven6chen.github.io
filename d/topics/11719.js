Up to 25 percent of infants with CHD have a &quot;critical&quot; defect. Numerous familial, maternal, and pregnancy-related factors have been reported to be associated with an increased risk of CHD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F103088\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103088 \">table 2</a>). In addition, CHD is a common finding in a number of genetic syndromes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81423 \">table 3</a>). The epidemiology of critical CHD is discussed in detail separately.

However, up to 30 percent of infants with critical CHD appear normal on routine examination and signs of critical CHD may not be apparent in the first days of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Cyanosis may not be clinically apparent in patients with mild desaturation (&gt;80 percent saturation) or anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In darkly pigmented infants, cyanosis can be especially difficult to appreciate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=identifying-newborns-with-critical-congenital-heart-disease#H608469901\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Identifying newborns with critical congenital heart disease&quot;, section on 'Postnatal diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The timing of presentation varies with the underlying lesion and its dependence upon a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). In patients with ductal-dependent lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F103087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103087 \">table 1</a>), closure of the PDA within the first few days of life can precipitate rapid clinical deterioration with potentially life-threatening consequences (ie, severe metabolic acidosis, seizures, cardiogenic shock, cardiac arrest, or end-organ injury) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Other patients may have lesions that are not dependent on the patency of the PDA (eg, total anomalous pulmonary venous return, truncus arteriosus), yet delayed diagnosis can similarly lead to poor outcomes. For infants with critical CHD who are not diagnosed during the birth hospitalization, the risk of mortality is as high as 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry/abstract/9,11,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,19</a>].</p><p>In a population-based observational study of 3603 infants with critical CHD born in 1998 to 2007 (prior to institution of routine pulse oximetry screening) identified through a state Birth Defects Registry, approximately one-quarter of patients were not diagnosed during the birth hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In this group of late detected critical CHD (n = 825), 15 deaths were deemed to be potentially preventable (1.8 percent). In addition, adjusted multivariable analysis showed that infants with late detected critical CHD had a greater number of admissions, more hospitalized days, and higher inpatient costs than those diagnosed prenatally or during the birth hospitalization.</p><p>In a simulation model based upon estimates of birth prevalence, prenatal diagnosis rates, late detection rates, and sensitivity of pulse oximetry screening, one study estimated that 875 infants with critical CHD will be detected annually in the United States through newborn screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

In this cohort, there was a lower rate of missed diagnoses of critical CHD for infants in the region that screened with universal pulse oximetry compared with infants born in regions of the country where universal screening with pulse oximetry was not performed (8 versus 28 percent). In addition, no infant died from a ductal-dependent lesion in the region utilizing routine pulse oximetry versus five deaths from regions without routine oximetry.</p><p>In a report of one statewide screening program (2011 to 2012) that successfully screened 99 percent of 73,320 eligible infants born during the study period, 49 infants had a positive screen and underwent further diagnostic evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Of the 49 infants with positive screens, 19 had additional signs and symptoms that would have triggered a diagnostic evaluation, whereas 30 underwent evaluation based solely upon the screening result. Of these, three had a previously undiagnosed critical CHD.</p><p>Further evidence that screening may reduce CHD-related mortality comes from a study that evaluated the relationship between implementation of state newborn CHD screening policies and early infant death rates due to critical CHD from 2007 through 2013 (before and after screening for critical CHD was added to the United States' Recommended Uniform Screening Panel for newborns) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. During this period, eight states implemented policies requiring critical CHD screening, which was associated with a 33 percent reduction in early infant mortality due to critical CHD compared with states without mandatory screening (absolute decrease of 3.9 deaths per 100&#8239;,000 births).</p><p>A secondary benefit of pulse oximetry screening is the identification of conditions other than critical CHD. Common noncardiac causes of hypoxemia that are identified through newborn pulse oximetry screening include sepsis, respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), meconium aspiration, hypothermia, hemoglobinopathy, pneumonia, and pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry/abstract/14,21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,21,23</a>]. Of the 30 infants identified in the statewide screening program mentioned above, 17 were found to have an important underlying medical condition other than critical CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

In the statewide screening program mentioned above, the false-positive rate was 0.06 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Infants with false-positive screening results undergo additional testing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transfer to centers with more advanced pediatric cardiac care. This additional testing has the potential to cause discomfort or harm to the newborn and to cause anxiety in the parents. It is important to recognize, however, that in many cases the evaluation results in identification of other causes of hypoxemia.</p><p>In a study evaluating the acceptability of pulse oximetry testing to the parents of newborns, parents were mostly satisfied with screening, perceived it as an important test, and would recommend it to others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Either disposable or reusable probes can be used. Reusable probes reduce the cost of screening, but must be appropriately cleaned to minimize the risk of infection.

In a study that evaluated different criteria for an abnormal pulse oximetry test, lowering the SpO<sub>2</sub> threshold from &lt;95 to &lt;90 percent resulted in greater specificity (88 versus 100 percent, respectively) but lower sensitivity (75 versus 53 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Hence, using a lower SpO<sub>2</sub> threshold decreases the number of false positives and thus may avoid unnecessary transfers, echocardiograms, and pediatric cardiology consultations. However, this comes at the cost of potentially missing some infants with critical CHD.</p><p>In a large multicenter prospective study of 122,738 newborn infants born between 2011 and 2012, the sensitivity of detecting critical CHD was greatest using the combination of pulse oximetry plus clinical assessment (93 percent) compared with either pulse oximetry alone (84 percent) or clinical assessment alone (77 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1908478726\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of infants with positive screens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A neonate with hypoxemia should be not discharged from the hospital without excluding potentially life-threatening conditions. Infants with positive screening results should undergo evaluation to identify the cause of hypoxemia. Determination of critical CHD as the cause should include high-quality echocardiography with interpretation by a clinician with expertise in the diagnosis of CHD. Patients should have access to these diagnostic services at the birth center, via telemedicine, or via short-distance transport. Each birthing institution should establish a protocol to ensure a timely evaluation for newborns with a positive screening test. However, evaluation of the baby with low oxygen saturation using other means (eg, chest radiograph, blood work) should not be delayed while awaiting an echocardiogram.

It is estimated that universal newborn screening with pulse oximetry may miss as many cases of critical CHD as it detects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/newborn-screening-for-critical-congenital-heart-disease-using-pulse-oximetry/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Critical CHD, defined as requiring surgery or catheter-based intervention in the first year of life (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F103087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103087 \">table 1</a>), occurs in approximately 25 percent of those with CHD. In infants with critical cardiac lesions, the risk of morbidity and mortality increases when there is a delay in diagnosis and timely referral to a tertiary center with expertise in treating these patients. (See <a href=\"#H1212691257\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of critical CHD screening in newborns is to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with delayed diagnosis by identifying infants with critical CHD in a timely manner. There is evidence that universal screening with pulse oximetry improves the identification of patients with critical CHD compared with physical examination alone and may lead to decreased infant mortality from critical CHD. (See <a href=\"#H1212691257\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1212692118\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence of critical CHD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CHD lesions targeted by pulse oximetry screening include defects which typically a) require intervention in the first year of life, and b) present with hypoxemia some or most of the time.
