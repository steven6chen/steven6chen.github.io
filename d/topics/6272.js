These viruses are highly species specific; human papillomaviruses (HPV) infect only humans. There are more than 200 types of HPV, which can be subdivided into cutaneous or mucosal categories based upon their tissue tropism.</p><p>The epidemiology and disease associations of HPV infections will be reviewed here. The role of HPV in the pathogenesis of epithelial cancers is discussed elsewhere.

The L1 protein, expressed recombinantly in a cell-culture system, self-assembles in the absence of the viral genome to form a virus-like particle (VLP). The L1 VLP is the immunogen used in the HPV vaccines. L2 is the minor capsid protein that along with L1 mediates HPV infectivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The replication cycle of the virus is integrally linked to epithelial differentiation (ie, the maturation of the keratinocyte). Initial infection of the basal stem cell occurs as the result of microscopic breaks in the epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The infecting HPV virions appear to attach to the basal stem cell via tissue-specific heparan sulfate proteoglycans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>Specific gene products are transcribed at every level of differentiation of the squamous keratinocyte [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. At the most superficial level, the genes for the L1, L2, and E4 genes are transcribed for assembly of the viral capsid into which the HPV genome is packaged. Upon desquamation of this short-lived cell, infectious HPV virions are released for the next round of infection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2496905848\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most HPV infections, including those with carcinogenic HPV genotypes, typically resolve within 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. During productive cervical HPV infection, low-grade cytological abnormalities may be clinically detectable in screening, but are usually transient. However, carcinogenic HPV infections that persist beyond 12 months increase the likelihood of precancerous or cancerous lesions, although not all persistent infections progress. In the United States, the median age of cytologically detected precancerous cervical lesions occurs approximately 10 years after the median age of sexual debut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>HPV can enter a latent state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

Introduction of HPV vaccination has been associated with declines in HPV prevalence and incidence. (See <a href=\"#H2022977027\" class=\"local\">'Impact of HPV vaccine'</a> below.)</p><p>The prevalence of genital HPV infection in the United States has been assessed by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), for which female participants submit vaginal swabs for HPV DNA testing. Between 2013 and 2014, the prevalence among females aged 18 to 59 years was 40 percent for all HPV types and 20 percent for high-risk HPV types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. In an earlier, prevaccine era NHANES survey that included 2603 women aged 14 to 59 years, 30 percent had serologic evidence of prior infection with one of the seven high-risk HPV types included in the 9-valent vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. This proportion is thought to be an underestimation of the true exposure burden, as natural infection does not always result in detectable antibody levels, which additionally may wane with age. Furthermore, these are only point-prevalence estimates; lifetime risk of genital HPV infection is much higher.</p><p>The incidence of HPV infection is also high among young sexually active females soon after their sexual debut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/66,68,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,68,72</a>].

The overall incidence of HPV infection was similar between black and white women, but black women had a slightly higher incidence of infection with high-risk HPV types. Two years after the incident high-risk HPV infection, more black women had persistent infection (56 versus 24 percent of white women). These findings might partially explain the higher incidence of cervical cancer in black women in the United States.

As an example, in an HPV prevalence study from 11 countries that included over 15,000 sexually active women with normal cervical cytology, women in Europe with HPV infection were more likely to be infected with HPV type 16 compared with those in Sub-Saharan Africa (odds ratio [OR] 2.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. </p><p>In a study of 1275 females aged 12 to 24 years seeking health services in Uganda, the prevalence HPV and HIV infections was 75 and 9 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].

The cause of this is unknown. </p><p>Among older women, the prevalence of HPV detection might be related to persistence or reactivation of previously acquired infection rather than new, recent infections. In a cohort of over 800 women aged 35 to 60 years, the attributable risk for high-risk HPV detection associated with a history of more than five lifetime sexual partners was greater than that associated with a new sexual partner among women older than 50 years (87 versus 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In contrast, among women 35 to 49 years, the attributable risks associated with lifetime and recent sexual partners were the same (28 percent).

Almost one-third of study participants were infected with oncogenic HPV types.

The overall median time to clearance of HPV infection was 7.5 months, although it was one year for HPV type 16.</p><p/><p>Other, smaller studies of men in the United States have shown comparable HPV rates and associated factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/132-134\" class=\"abstract_t\">132-134</a>]. These rates may differ in various regions of the world. A study of 776 heterosexual HIV-uninfected men in rural Uganda reported a high incidence of oncogenic genital HPV infection (33 cases per 100 person-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>]. The risk of infection decreased with age, married status, and circumcision; condom use had no association. In another study of 3463 heterosexual men from Latin America, North America, Africa, Europe, and Asia, the prevalence of genital HPV was 21 percent for any type, although fewer types were tested for in this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. Neither condom use nor circumcision was associated with HPV infection. The prevalence of HPV was lowest in Asia and highest in Africa.</p><p>Few studies have evaluated the frequency of anal HPV infection in heterosexual men, but it appears to be less than that of genital HPV infection. In a study that included 1305 heterosexual men, anal infection with any HPV type was detected in 12 percent, over half of whom carried an oncogenic type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. Approximately 50 percent of the heterosexual men with anal HPV infection had the same HPV type detected on genital sampling. Risk factors for anal HPV infection included increased lifetime number of female sex partners, shorter duration of relationship with the current sex partner, prior genital HPV infection, and past diagnosis of hepatitis B virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/120,136\" class=\"abstract_t\">120,136</a>].</p><p>The high rates of infection in these study populations suggest that strategies for the prevention of HPV infection also need to target men.

Circumcised men were less likely to have prevalent genital HPV infection than uncircumcised men (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.45-0.71).

HPV detection was highest at the penile shaft (50 percent) and lowest in the urethra and in semen (10 and 5 percent, respectively). Another prevalence study of 379 males also demonstrated a wide range of infection rates depending on the site sampled (eg, 6 percent in semen to 52 percent on the penile shaft) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>].</p><p>The findings were different in the incidence study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>]. Sampling of the glans, penile shaft, and scrotum demonstrated that genital infection in men is multifocal and that there is no clear preferential site for infection.

Many studies have reported declining prevalence and incidence of HPV infection as well as HPV-related disease following the introduction of HPV vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/140-155\" class=\"abstract_t\">140-155</a>]. As an example, in the United States, the prevalence of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 in cervical samples from females from the prevaccine (2003 to 2006) and post-vaccine (2011 to 2013) eras decreased by 71 percent (from 11.5 to 3.3 percent) among those aged 14 to 19 years and by 61 percent (from 18.5 to 7.2 percent) among those aged 20 to 24 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/156\" class=\"abstract_t\">156</a>]. This observation was made despite suboptimal vaccine coverage, with only an estimated 55 percent of adolescent girls receiving at least one vaccine dose. Declines in vaccine-type HPV infections have also been observed among nonvaccinated groups, suggesting herd immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/154,155,157\" class=\"abstract_t\">154,155,157</a>].</p><p>The impact of HPV vaccination on HPV-associated disease is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Also, consistent with the observed sex distribution for HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer, the prevalence of oropharyngeal HPV infection in men is higher than in women. In a cross-sectional study of men and women who provided an oral rinse sample for HPV DNA sampling, the prevalence of oropharyngeal infection among 4493 men was 11.5 percent for any HPV type and 7.3 percent for high-risk HPV types; among the 4641 women, the prevalence was 3.2 and 1.4 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/161\" class=\"abstract_t\">161</a>]. The prevalence of high-risk HPV infection was especially high (22.2 percent) among men reporting two or more lifetime same-sex oral sex partners. Oropharyngeal HPV prevalence has been associated with a greater number of sexual (including oral sex) and open-mouthed kissing partners in both men and women, as well as with older age and smoking (both tobacco and marijuana) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/52,158,161-163\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,158,161-163</a>].</p><p>Similarly, the incidence of oropharyngeal HPV is lower than that of anogenital HPV infection. In a study of 1626 men aged 18 to 70 years (88 percent men who have sex with women only) without a prior history of HPV-associated disease and with a median follow-up of 13 months, 4.4 percent acquired an oropharyngeal infection with any HPV type, and 1.7 percent with an oncogenic HPV type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/164\" class=\"abstract_t\">164</a>]. The incidence of oropharyngeal HPV infection was 5.6 and 2.5 cases per 1000 person-months for any and oncogenic types, respectively, and was constant across all age groups. In multivariate analysis, acquisition of a new oncogenic oropharyngeal HPV infection was associated with former or current smoking and being unmarried, but not with number of sexual partners or oral sex partners. Of the infections with enough longitudinal follow-up, 45 of 81 (56 percent) oral infections with any type and 18 of 24 (75 percent) infections with oncogenic types spontaneously cleared, at a median of six to seven months.</p><p>There is emerging evidence that HPV vaccination can protect against oropharyngeal HPV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/165\" class=\"abstract_t\">165</a>].

Infection with multiple HPV types is also more common among HIV-infected individuals. In a study of 486 heterosexual South African couples followed for up to 24 months, new HPV infection was detected more frequently in HIV-infected women (57 versus 27 events per 1000 person-months) and men (80 versus 52 events per 1000 person-months) compared with HIV-uninfected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/168\" class=\"abstract_t\">168</a>]. Furthermore, HIV infection was independently associated with a decreased likelihood of clearance of HPV infection over time.</p><p>Another study evaluated the concordance of HPV infection among 254 heterosexually active couples and the impact of HIV coinfection on the prevalence of HPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/167\" class=\"abstract_t\">167</a>].

In a meta-analysis of 53 studies, the pooled prevalence of anal HPV infection was considerably higher in HIV-infected men (93 and 74 percent for any type and any high-risk type, respectively, compared with 64 and 37 percent in HIV-uninfected MSM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. </p><p>The use of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) may attenuate the risk of HPV infection and persistence among HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/169,174-176\" class=\"abstract_t\">169,174-176</a>], although data are conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/177\" class=\"abstract_t\">177</a>]. As an example, in a study of 652 HIV-infected women, among whom the baseline prevalence of high-risk HPV was 42 percent, ART use and HIV RNA suppression for more than two years were each independently associated with a lower risk of high-risk HPV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/174\" class=\"abstract_t\">174</a>]. Sustained HIV RNA suppression was also marginally associated with clearance of high-risk HPV infection (odds ratio 1.02, 95% CI 1.001-1.04). Other studies have not shown an association between ART use and decreased HPV risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/178\" class=\"abstract_t\">178</a>]. The effect of ART on the risk of HPV-associated neoplasia is discussed elsewhere.

Whether HPV infection itself predisposes to subsequent HIV infection or is simply a marker of increased HIV risk remains unknown. It is also unclear whether prevalent HPV infection or the immune response associated with clearing that HPV infection, or both, plays a role in potentiating HIV acquisition.</p><p>The first evidence for an association between HPV infection and increased risk of HIV acquisition came from studies of MSM. In a cohort of HIV-uninfected MSM, infection with more than one anal HPV type was significantly associated with HIV seroconversion (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 3.5; 95% CI 1.2&ndash;10.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/179\" class=\"abstract_t\">179</a>]. Subsequent studies suggest that penile HPV infection is also a risk factor for subsequent HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/180\" class=\"abstract_t\">180</a>]. HIV-uninfected men in Kenya (n = 2168) who were participating in a randomized trial of male circumcision underwent HPV DNA sampling of their <span class=\"nowrap\">glans/coronal</span> sulcus and were followed up for 42 months for evidence of HIV acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/180\" class=\"abstract_t\">180</a>]. Approximately 50 percent of the men had evidence of HPV DNA at baseline. After controlling for subsequent circumcision status, baseline herpes simplex virus type 2 serostatus, and other sexual risk factors, those men who were infected with HPV at baseline had a significantly higher risk of HIV acquisition compared with men without HPV infection (HR 1.8; 95% CI 1.1-2.9).</p><p>In contrast, in a case-control study of 44 men who acquired HIV infection and 787 HIV-uninfected men who had been followed in a circumcision trial, penile HPV acquisition was not associated with HIV acquisition after controlling for other HIV transmission risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/181\" class=\"abstract_t\">181</a>]. However, an association between clearance of HPV infection and subsequent HIV infection was observed in this study and postulated to be related to changes in local immune responses that might predispose to HIV infection.</p><p>The presence of HPV infection also appears to be associated with an increased risk of HIV acquisition among women. In a meta-analysis of prospective studies of women who underwent HPV testing, HIV acquisition was associated with baseline HPV infection of any type and high-risk type (HRs 2.06 [95% CI 1.44-2.94] and 1.99 [95% CI 1.54-2.56], respectively) when compared with no baseline HPV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/182\" class=\"abstract_t\">182</a>]. Of note, several included studies did not assess or adjust for sexual behavior or other coincident sexually transmitted infections, which are significant potential confounders in the association between HPV and HIV. In a separate study of women from Zimbabwe, clearance of cervical HPV infection was associated with risk of HIV acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations/abstract/183\" class=\"abstract_t\">183</a>], similar to the association with clearance of penile HPV infection described in the study above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

HPV can be transmitted from one epithelial surface to another. Most infections typically resolve within 12 months. However, persistent infection with high-risk HPV types can increase the risk of precancerous or cancerous lesions.

Mucocutaneous infection with HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 is associated with genital warts and precancerous and cancerous lesions of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, and oropharynx. Evidence linking HPV to cervical carcinoma is extensive, with HPV 16 accounting for approximately 50 percent of invasive cervical cancers, and HPV 18 for 20 percent.

Penile HPV infection is also highly prevalent among males, and anal infection is common among females and men who have sex with men.
