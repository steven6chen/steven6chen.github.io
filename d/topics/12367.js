The major symptom associated with this dysfunction is diplopia. The evaluation of neuromuscular diplopia is reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three pairs of extraocular muscles move each eye in three directions: vertically (superior and inferior), horizontally (medial and lateral), and torsionally (intorsion when the eye rotates toward the patient's nose and extorsion when the eye rotates toward the patient's shoulder). The following muscles are responsible for these movements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72952\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72952 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75770\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75770 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F58849\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58849 \">figure 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The superior rectus and inferior oblique muscles are responsible for upward vertical movements.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESENTATION/HISTORY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Diplopia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Be sure to determine that the diplopia is present only with both eyes open and absent when either eye is closed (binocular diplopia). Binocular diplopia suggests that the underlying problem is due to ocular misalignment; generally, patients will choose to close the eye with the dysfunctional muscle unless that is the eye with much better vision. Monocular diplopia (persists with one eye closed) suggests local eye disease or refractive error; this is generally a problem that should be referred to an ophthalmologist and is not discussed further here. Triple vision or triplopia is a rare complaint in patients with extraocular paresis, usually as a transient phenomenon in patients with superimposed nystagmus or oscillopsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Multiple images with one or both eyes is also a common complaint in patients with nuclear sclerotic cataract.</p><p>Important questions to ask the patient with binocular diplopia include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In which field of gaze is the double vision worst? The worst position of gaze represents the field of action of a paretic muscle (eg, with a right lateral rectus palsy, diplopia is greatest on right lateral gaze). If a muscle is restricted however, as in thyroid disease, the double vision is worst when trying to stretch the muscle, that is, opposite to its field of action. Thus, a patient with thyroid ophthalmopathy cannot look up because the inferior rectus is tight, not because the superior rectus is weak.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In which field of gaze are the double images closest together?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the separation of images vertical, horizontal, or oblique?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there any corrective head position that makes the double vision tolerable?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the double vision worse at a distance (typical of a sixth nerve palsy) or is it worse at near (typical of a medial rectus palsy)?</p><p/><p>Some patients lack diplopia despite obvious ocular misalignment. There may be a number of explanations for this finding:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vision may be suppressed in one eye because of an old strabismus. Some patients with strabismus can develop a type of peripheral double vision if they have anomalous retinal correspondence, which is then followed by the original angle of the double vision changing because of neuromuscular disease or a change in the angle of the strabismus with age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may have decreased vision in one eye, in which case the double vision will only be for objects large enough to see by the eye with poor vision.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients have such a wide separation of the images that they are able to ignore one of the images because it is far out of alignment with the true straight-ahead image.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients have such a minimal separation of the images that they cannot appreciate that they are seeing two images. They complain, instead, of &quot;blurred vision&quot;, which is really a combination of two images.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients will have a misalignment only when the eyes are moving. However, vision is suppressed when the eyes are moving so that they are not aware of a double vision.</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ask the patient about the presence or absence of any ocular, orbital, or periorbital pain and request that the patient point to the location of the pain. Painful ophthalmoplegia has a specific differential diagnosis that is distinct from painless ophthalmoplegia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77825\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77825 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffuse intracranial pathology is suggested by complaints of a generalized headache or pain in the area of the temple. In contrast, it is most likely that the patient has an isolated lesion of one of the cranial nerves if the pain is localized to the area just above the eyebrow on the side of the weak muscle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intraorbital pathology should be considered in patients with pain localized directly to the eye.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden onset of head pain described as the worst ever experienced should be a cause for concern and suggests an intracranial aneurysm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another worrisome type of pain is one that is severe, requires heavy opiate-type medication, and is distributed to the area of the first or second division of the fifth cranial nerve. It is important in such cases to carefully test for sensory loss in the area of the forehead and cheek; such a symptom often indicates that there is a tumor pressing on the fifth cranial nerve as well as the affected nerve to the eye muscle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain on eye movement suggests a myopathy or an orbital process. Pain on eye movement but without double vision is also typical of optic neuritis.</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Tempo of the problem</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ask the duration of the problem. Sometimes old photographs are useful in doubtful cases. Old photographs are particularly helpful in cases of lid ptosis, fourth nerve palsy, and pupillary abnormalities.</p><p>Was the onset sudden and has now plateaued, or gradual with steady worsening? Did the pain precede the palsy and resolve shortly after the palsy started? This is a particularly good sign; it is typical of idiopathic or ischemic etiologies (eg, due to diabetes mellitus).</p><p>Does the motility problem change as the day goes on? This is a typical sign of myasthenia gravis but myasthenia gravis is not necessarily the only cause of this symptom.</p><p>Finally, one should ask a broad question about any other symptoms, particularly neurologic symptoms, that occurred with the double vision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EXAMINATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Pupil</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the parasympathetic fibers of the third nerve are involved, resulting in pupillary dilation in association with other dysfunction of the third cranial nerve, it is a warning sign of a compressive lesion of the third nerve, typically an aneurysm or, less commonly, a tumor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-anisocoria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with anisocoria&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Other cranial nerves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The second important observation is the possible involvement of any other cranial nerves. Mononeuropathies (dysfunction of only one cranial nerve) are often idiopathic. However, polyneuropathies require a full and extensive neuroradiologic and laboratory workup. Of particular importance are processes that involve the nerves near the third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves. As examples: the second cranial nerve is concerned with vision, the pupillary light reaction, and visual fields; the fifth cranial nerve is responsible for facial and corneal sensation; abnormalities of the seventh cranial nerve may cause facial droop or weakness of the orbicularis oculi muscle; pathology of the eighth cranial nerve can be suggested by dizziness or loss of hearing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;, section on 'Cranial nerve examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Globe</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another important associated observation is the presence or absence of any forward protrusion of the eye, exophthalmos (suggestive of Grave's disease). To assess for the presence of exophthalmos, I like to have the patient look down while I retract the upper lids and I look down past the patient's brow to compare the forward location of the two corneas. A small amount of upper lid ptosis, often present in these cases, will mask the appearance of exophthalmos as viewed from straight ahead. In testing for orbital resiliency, that is how easily can one retroplace the globe digitally, I stand to the side of the patient and observe the eye going back when I press with my finger. This gives me a visual and tactile input.</p><p>Observe whether the eyeball is congested. Ask the patient to assume the head position that maximizes the double vision and the one that minimizes the double vision. Is there any droopiness of the lid?</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Ocular motility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Details of the neurologic examination with regard to eye movements are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is often enough merely to observe the eye movement in the right, left, up, and down gaze (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F58849\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58849 \">figure 2</a>). In the more profound expressions of ocular motility disturbance, the astute observer can determine which muscle is dysfunctional by making these observations alone. The following are some simple rules:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the double vision is worse on looking to one side and better looking to the other, and if the eyes appear crossed, the problem is most likely that the lateral rectus muscle is not working. Usually this is due to a sixth nerve palsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is some droopiness of the lid and if any combination of the following things is present &mdash; poor inward turning, poor elevation, or poor depression of the eye, then there is probably at least a partial third nerve palsy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient likes to tilt his head to get better vision and if the double vision is primarily vertical and worst looking to one side and down, there is probably a fourth nerve palsy.</p><p/><p>With most patients one can hold a finger vertically or horizontally and move it into different fields of gaze asking in which field of gaze the image separation is the worst and in which it is the best. While you hold the finger in the field of gaze with the worst double vision, cover one eye and ask which image disappears. With a vertical diplopia, when the higher image disappears the eye you covered is lower in position than its partner is and vice-versa. With horizontal diplopia, when the image to the right of the other image disappears, the eye you covered is pointed to the left of its partner. Crossed diplopia means uncrossed eyes and vice-versa.</p><p>A relatively simple office test that can be helpful is use of a red glass over one eye. This device helps the patient identify the two images more clearly and helps the clinician identify from which eye each image is coming. However, the results of this test should be interpreted with caution; some patients seem to be able to fuse the red and white light with effort. Also, some patients give interpretations which I find confusing, saying for instance, that they see one light on top of the other when they mean that the lights are superimposed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Restrictive ophthalmoplegia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a patient has a tight and fibrous or entrapped muscle, attempted gaze in the direction away from the field of action of the muscle will result in a rise in intraocular pressure. A rise of 7 mmHg is considered diagnostic of restrictive ophthalmopathy. On examination, the patient will appear to have a weakness of the opponent muscle due to failure of relaxation of the restricted muscle. A patient with Graves' disease will frequently have this problem due to fibrosis of the inferior rectus muscle. In such cases, on attempted upward gaze the intraocular pressure will rise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Quantitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several ways to precisely measure the amount of eye deviation. Prism measurements are commonly used since this number is necessary if the ultimate goal is to correct the deviation with a prism in the glasses, or at least to help the patient with a prism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY/DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuromuscular diplopia may arise due to a number of causes, including a neurogenic lesion (supra-, inter-, or infranuclear), a neuromuscular transmission defect, myopathy, or mechanical restriction in the orbit. An exhaustive summary of these etiologies is the subject of other reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Some helpful clues in patients with vertical or horizontal diplopia and some of the more common acquired causes of diplopia are discussed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Vertical diplopia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with vertical diplopia complain of seeing two diagonally displaced images, one atop the other. There are many causes of vertical diplopia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F52647\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52647 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Vertical diplopia in primary gaze suggests underactivity of the right or left inferior rectus, superior rectus, inferior oblique, or superior oblique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. If vertical separation is worse on right gaze, the right superior or inferior rectus or the left inferior or superior oblique may be underactive; separation that is worse looking to the right and down suggests underactivity of the right inferior rectus or left superior oblique. Torsional abnormalities due to oblique muscle involvement should be suspected in patients who complain of image separation that worsens or improves with left or right head tilt.</p><p>The direction of compensatory head tilt may provide further diagnostic clues. Underaction of the superior or inferior rectus muscles is compensated by chin flexion or extension. Torsional diplopia due to underaction of the oblique muscles may be associated with an angular head tilt.</p><p>Hypertropia refers to an upward vertical displacement of one eye in primary gaze. A right hypertropia occurs with paresis of the right eye depressors (right inferior rectus or superior oblique) or left eye elevators (left superior rectus or inferior oblique). If the right hypertropia increases in left gaze, either the right superior oblique or the left superior rectus muscle is underacting. If the vertical deviation increases with right head tilt, the right superior oblique muscle is weak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>A skew eye deviation presenting with hypertropia and vertical diplopia can result from an imbalance in the vestibular system. In such patients, the diplopia typically does not match ocular muscle function and the deviation changes when the patient is tested sitting versus lying down. These features can distinguish a skew eye deviation from extraocular paresis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Horizontal diplopia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Horizontal diplopia is usually due to disease processes that affect the medial or lateral rectus muscles or the innervation of these muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The images appear side by side; as mentioned above, image separation that is worse at a distance is typical of a sixth nerve palsy, while image separation that is worse at near is typical of a medial rectus palsy. An esotropia refers to a medial deviation of the eye at primary gaze, an exotropia refers to lateral deviation in primary gaze. There are many causes of horizontal diplopia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56887\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56887 \">table 4</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Fourth cranial nerve palsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cranial nerve IV palsy is a common cause of vertical diplopia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Most fourth nerve palsies are either traumatic or idiopathic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Congenital</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with congenital fourth nerve palsy are often able to compensate for the double vision with a head tilt that minimizes symptoms. Over time, however, they may have increasing difficulty controlling the symptoms and present with diplopia. The patient may insist that this is a new problem, although old photos frequently demonstrate a head tilt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A peculiar feature of congenital fourth nerve palsy is that the amount of hypertropia in the primary position is very large (deviations as high as 20 or 30 prism diopters). A true acquired fourth nerve palsy of recent onset will have a hypertropia that measures prism diopters in the mid-teens in the primary position at the most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Traumatic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traumatic fourth nerve palsies, in contrast to traumatic third and sixth nerve palsies, may occur with a relatively mild blow to the head that is not associated with loss of consciousness or a skull fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Some traumatic fourth nerve palsies improve with time, but most do not. Careful examination is important to exclude bilateral fourth nerve palsies which can be very asymmetrical; it is unfortunate for a surgeon to have corrected a fourth nerve palsy by weakening the ipsilateral inferior oblique muscle, only to find a contralateral fourth nerve palsy now uncovered and obvious to the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Idiopathic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Idiopathic fourth nerve palsies, like idiopathic third and sixth nerve palsies, often present with pain over the eyebrow of the affected eye that stops shortly after the diplopia starts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. When asked to point to the pain, patients usually indicate an area just above the brow on the side of the muscle weakness. Rarely does the pain require medication. The best time to diagnose a third, fourth, or sixth nerve palsy is early in its course. If the palsy does not resolve there is a tendency for the deviation to become more &quot;comitant.&quot; This means the hypertropia, esotropia, or exotropia that was once limited largely to one field of gaze will creep into the opposite field due to the contraction and thus overaction of the antagonistic muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely a fourth nerve palsy can be due to raised intracranial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It is important to look carefully at the optic nerve head to be sure that there is no papilledema.</p><p>The fourth nerve exits from the dorsum of the brainstem. Thus, neurologic signs of cerebellar disease may be present if a tumor in that region is causing the fourth nerve palsy.</p><p>Most fourth cranial nerve palsies are either idiopathic or traumatic. The idiopathic ones usually resolve in a few weeks. I typically postpone neuroradiologic testing until two months have passed without improvement as long as the other cranial nerves are normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Third cranial nerve palsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Third cranial nerve palsies may cause both vertical and horizontal diplopia. Patients with a complete unilateral third nerve palsy have ptosis, a large unreactive pupil, and paralysis of adduction, elevation, and depression; the eye rests in a position of abduction, slight depression, and intorsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The asymmetry of pupil size is greater in the light than in the dark.</p><p>Absence of pupillary involvement suggests a benign process that can be observed over a couple of weeks. A fixed, dilated pupil requires extensive neurologic evaluation. Partial involvement of the pupil (defined in one report as anisocoria greater than 0.5 but less than 2.0 mm in room light, and whose affected pupil maintained reactivity to light) may be associated with either serious or benign underlying pathologies; neuroimaging is indicated in these individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>This topic is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=third-cranial-nerve-oculomotor-nerve-palsy-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Third cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve) palsy in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Sixth nerve palsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with sixth cranial nerve palsies primarily complain of horizontal diplopia, although they may also complain of slight vertical diplopia. On examination there is an esotropia (inward deviation) that is worsened with gaze into the field of the weak lateral rectus muscle. To limit diplopia, patients may assume a compensatory face turn in the direction of the paralyzed muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Abduction is commonly limited on the side of the lesion.</p><p>Patients with idiopathic sixth nerve palsy often present with the sudden onset of horizontal diplopia that is better at near and worse at a distance. There may be minor pain over the affected eyebrow at the onset of the double vision, but no disturbing pain distributed over the forehead or face. The remainder of the neurologic examination is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Poorly controlled diabetes is a predisposing factor, and one population-based study found that patients with isolated six nerve palsy had a six-fold increase in the odds of diabetes compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Other causes of sixth nerve palsy are shown in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80526\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80526 \">table 5</a>). </p><p>A sudden onset distinguishes idiopathic sixth cranial nerve palsies from tumor or myasthenia gravis. Spontaneous improvement over several weeks to months is expected, and failure to improve suggests more serious intracranial pathology. As an example, in a study of 213 patients with unilateral isolated sixth nerve palsies in whom trauma was excluded, 78 percent experienced spontaneous recovery of their palsy, 37 percent recovering by 8 weeks and 74 percent by 24 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Only 16 percent failed to recover; of this group, however, almost 40 percent had serious underlying pathology accounting for their palsy.</p><p>Patients with bilateral sixth nerve palsy will have progressive horizontal double vision as a presenting symptom. The point of least inward turn will always be to the side of the stronger lateral rectus. One may have to depend upon observation of the abducting eye to decide if both lateral recti are weak. This decision is very important. An ominous sign in any cranial nerve palsy is the involvement of any other cranial nerve, even its partner on the other side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The sixth nerve is a case in point because it has a long and relatively isolated course after it exits the brainstem, climbs up the clivus, and passes through the cavernous sinus. This allows certain tumors to affect both sixth nerves before any other parts of the brain are affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p>Other nerves to pay particular attention to when dealing with sixth nerve palsies are the fifth nerve, pointing to a lesion in the cavernous sinus, and papilledema, suggesting a mass lesion causing raised intracranial pressure and displacement of the brainstem and thus stretching of one or both sixth nerves. Involvement of cranial nerve V causes reduced facial sensation, often around the upper face and cornea. Despite the anesthesia in this area, however, patients with mass lesions may complain of severe pain around the eye (often requiring opiates).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Internuclear ophthalmoplegia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Internuclear ophthalmoplegia is a specific gaze abnormality characterized by impaired horizontal eye movement with weak adduction of the affected eye and abduction nystagmus of the contralateral eye. This results from a lesion (usually stroke or demyelination) in the medial longitudinal fasciculus in the dorsomedial brainstem tegmentum of either the pons or the midbrain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=internuclear-ophthalmoparesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Internuclear ophthalmoparesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Myasthenia gravis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extraocular eye muscles are often involved in myasthenia gravis (MG). The clinical manifestations vary from subtle blurring of vision to severe diplopia. MG-induced diplopia can mimic an internuclear ophthalmoplegia. Weakness of the eye muscles in MG can also produce ptosis, the degree of which is variable, switching from one eye to the other on separate examinations and occasionally increasing with sudden exposure to bright light. Most patients with MG do not complain of eye pain or headache. Fatigability and variability of clinical findings are characteristic.</p><p>Physical examination may reveal unusual eye movements that do not conform to the anatomy of one nerve or muscle. The pupils are always spared in MG, helping in the differentiation from other disorders such as botulism. The diagnosis and treatment of myasthenia gravis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ocular-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ocular myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Thyroid ophthalmopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid ophthalmopathy is a common cause of horizontal or vertical diplopia. Restriction of extraocular movement preferentially affects the inferior rectus, medial rectus, and superior rectus, in that order [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Because the process causes muscle tightness or restriction, the diplopia is worse in the direction opposite that of the involved muscle action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, hypertropia (upward vertical deviation) and esotropia (medial deviation) are common in patients with thyroid ophthalmopathy, but exotropia (lateral deviation) is uncommon because the lateral rectus muscle is usually not involved.</p><p>Limitation in elevation of one or both eyes with vertical misalignment is the most common defect of ocular motility in these individuals. The other characteristic signs of thyroid ophthalmopathy include proptosis and periorbital edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy (ophthalmopathy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Ophthalmoplegic migraine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ophthalmoplegic migraine is rare and most often seen in children and young adults. It is a diagnosis that should be made only after other disorders have been ruled out. It may affect the third (most common), fourth, or sixth cranial nerves. Extraocular muscle paralysis can occur with the first attack of headache or, rarely, precede it. Permanent damage to the third nerve has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Other causes of painful ophthalmoplegia (eg, aneurysm) should be excluded with neuroimaging studies.</p><p>Ophthalmoplegic migraine is now considered a cranial neuralgia because MRI gadolinium enhancement of the cisternal segment of the affected cranial nerve has been demonstrated in patients with a typical clinical presentation, suggesting that the condition may be a recurrent demyelinating neuropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Wernicke's syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wernicke's syndrome is caused by thiamine deficiency and is typically associated with alcohol abuse. Patients with Wernicke's encephalopathy may complain of vertical diplopia due to a supranuclear or nuclear lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wernicke-encephalopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wernicke encephalopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Orbital myositis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Orbital myositis is an idiopathic inflammation of an extraocular muscle. The diagnosis should be considered in patients who have seemingly isolated extraocular muscle dysfunction, especially in the distribution of cranial nerve III.</p><p>Patients present with acute or subacute orbital pain and horizontal diplopia; absence of pain suggests an alternate diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. On physical examination there may be conjunctival chemosis and injection, ptosis, and proptosis. The process can be unilateral or bilateral. Neuroimaging reveals a focal or diffuse inflammatory lesion. The disorder usually resolves with corticosteroids&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-diplopia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], particularly in severe cases, although in my experience corticosteroids tend to prolong the course of what might otherwise be a self-limited illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Tolosa-Hunt syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a rare syndrome, which is characterized by painful ophthalmoplegia and is caused by an idiopathic granulomatous inflammation of the cavernous sinus. This syndrome responds to corticosteroid therapy.</p><p>While considered a benign condition, permanent neurologic deficits can occur, and relapses are common, often requiring prolonged immunosuppressive therapy. Tolosa-Hunt syndrome must also be carefully differentiated from more commonly occurring malignancies and infections involving the cavernous sinus, a task made difficult by the lack of a specific diagnostic test abnormality.

Multiple possible etiologies exist, many of which can be serious. Some important caveats are helpful:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first rule is to determine if a single nerve is involved. Involvement of other nerves, even the opposite cranial nerve (eg, bilateral sixth nerve palsy), suggests a more serious underlying disorder and requires more extensive evaluation, including neuroimaging (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tolosa-hunt-syndrome#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tolosa-Hunt syndrome&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tolosa-hunt-syndrome#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tolosa-Hunt syndrome&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second question is whether there is a medical excuse for the problem. As an example, one is more likely to work up a young person with a sixth nerve palsy than an older person in his seventies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of improvement over time almost always means the process is benign. Isolated fourth or sixth never palsies can be observed for a few weeks. More extensive work-up should be done if the palsy does not resolve or if other symptoms appear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of severe headache of sudden onset demands an urgent evaluation for cerebral aneurysm.</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62881940\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Binocular diplopia (double vision with both eyes open and absent when either eye is closed) often results from dysfunction of one or more of the extraocular muscles. In contrast monocular diplopia, which persists when one eye is closed, suggests local eye disease or a refractive problem. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Presentation/history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three pairs of extraocular muscles move each eye in three directions: vertically (superior and inferior), horizontally (medial and lateral), and torsionally (intorsion when the eye rotates toward the patient's nose and extorsion when the eye rotates toward the patient's shoulder) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72952\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72952 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75770\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75770 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F58849\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58849 \">figure 2</a>).
