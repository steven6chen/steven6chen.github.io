The meninges consist of three parts: the pia, arachnoid, and dura mater. Meningitis reflects inflammation of the arachnoid mater and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in both the subarachnoid space and in the cerebral ventricles.</p><p>Suspected bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency, and immediate diagnostic steps must be taken to establish the specific cause so that appropriate antimicrobial therapy can be initiated. The mortality rate of untreated bacterial meningitis approaches 100 percent, and even with optimal therapy, morbidity and mortality may occur. Neurologic sequelae are common among survivors. <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> is one of the most common causes of acute bacterial meningitis.</p><p>This topic reviews meningitis caused by <em>S. pneumoniae</em> (pneumococcal meningitis).

Despite prompt and appropriate care, it remains an important cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> below.)</p><p>The incidence of pneumococcal meningitis declined significantly after the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was added to the universal infant immunization schedule in the United States and other developed countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-meningitis-in-children/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. Population-based surveillance data from the United States indicate that the greatest decline occurred in children younger than two years (from 10.2 to 3.7 cases per 100,000 between 1998-1999 and 2004-2005, a decline of 64 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-meningitis-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Pneumococcal meningitis may occur despite immunization with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, usually due to nonvaccine serotypes. After the introduction of the heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), there was an increase in the proportion of cases of pneumococcal meningitis caused by serotypes not contained in the vaccine, particularly among children younger than two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-meningitis-in-children/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]. In population-based surveillance (1998&ndash;2007), serotypes 19A, 7F, 10A, and 22F were the most common non-PCV7 serotypes isolated from children with pneumococcal meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-meningitis-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Approximately 60 percent of cases were caused by serotypes contained in PCV13 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77274\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77274 \">table 1</a>), which replaced PCV7 in the United States in 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-meningitis-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The impact of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on invasive pneumococcal disease, antibiotic resistance, and nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococcus is discussed separately.
