The rash usually lasts about 4 to 6 weeks, but in some people, it can last for months.</p><p>Pityriasis rosea is most common in older children and young adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26584910\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes pityriasis rosea?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause is not known. But it does not seem to be easily spread from person to person.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26584925\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of pityriasis rosea?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many people, the rash starts with one round or oval patch. This spot is about the size of a half dollar but might be larger. A day or two later, many smaller spots about the size of a dime appear. But not everyone gets the large spot before the rest of the rash.</p><p>If you have light skin, the spots are usually pink or salmon-colored. If you have dark skin, the spots can be a red-brown color or darker than your skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65314\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65314 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>The spots might be:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On the belly, back, chest, arms, and legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spread out in a &quot;Christmas tree&quot; pattern on the back</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itchy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A little scaly</p><p/><p>In children, the spots sometimes happen on the face and scalp.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26584940\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for pityriasis rosea?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor or nurse will often be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam. But he or she might gently scrape the rash or do a different test to get a sample of your skin. Tests on the skin sample can help the doctor tell if you have pityriasis rosea or a different disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26584955\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a special kind of bath called an oatmeal bath. Use lukewarm, not hot water.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use unscented moisturizing lotion or cream on your skin.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep your body cool.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26584970\"><span class=\"h1\">How is pityriasis rosea treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people do not need any treatment. If the symptoms bother you, your doctor might prescribe creams or ointments to help with itching. In rare cases, doctors prescribe other medicines or a special type of treatment that uses lights, called &quot;phototherapy.&quot;</p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
