Patients who should be considered for LP include those with symptoms suggesting CNS or ocular involvement and patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in systemic relapse. In patients with APL, LP should be deferred until correction of the coagulopathy and, in the absence of symptoms, can usually be done after a second complete response is achieved. Even if the cerebrospinal fluid examination is negative, many experts recommend prophylactic treatment with intrathecal chemotherapy in patients with APL in second remission. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbar-puncture-technique-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbar puncture: Technique, indications, contraindications, and complications in adults&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory acute promyelocytic leukemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most serious complication of LP is cerebral herniation. Patients with the following clinical risk factors should have a computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan of the head prior to LP to identify a possible mass lesion and other causes of increased intracranial pressure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altered mentation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal neurologic signs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Papilledema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizure within the previous week</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Every effort should be taken to avoid a traumatic LP in patients with leukemia since this can lead to seeding of the leukemic blasts into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In addition, there is concern about bleeding at the site of the LP with the potential for spinal cord impingement. Thus, the most experienced clinician available should perform the LP. Many centers now refer patients to radiology to have the procedures done with the aid of fluoroscopy, which will presumably decrease the incidence of local tissue injury, although data to this effect are lacking. Prior to LP, an effort should be made to correct any underlying coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. We generally advise <strong>not</strong> performing an LP in patients with coagulation defects who are actively bleeding, have severe thrombocytopenia, or an INR &gt;1.4, without correcting the underlying abnormalities.</p><p>There is some controversy and relatively little data about the minimal platelet count at which an LP can be performed safely. A large study in children demonstrated the safety of LPs at platelet counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;10,000/microL,</span> although a larger study by the same group suggested that the rates of traumatic and bloody taps were higher with lower platelet counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/involvement-of-the-central-nervous-system-with-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Because of the concern about the introduction of circulating leukemia cells into the CSF, many centers routinely administer a dose of intrathecal chemotherapy when LPs are done in patients at diagnosis or in relapse.</p><p>It is difficult to extrapolate studies of children to adults because, unlike adults, most of the children were sedated during LP and because of physical differences between adults and children. Adults have a longer length of tissue that must be traversed to access the lumbar space. This general concern is magnified in the setting of obesity resulting in difficulties in the identification of the lumbar space. Based on an experience with 195 LPs in 66 patients with acute leukemia, it was suggested that a minimal platelet count of <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;20,000/microL</span> is desirable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/involvement-of-the-central-nervous-system-with-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These authors also noted an increase in the incidence of traumatic taps at lower platelet counts. A more recent review summarized the conundrum with the statement that &quot;40,000 x 10<sup>9</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/L</span> is a 'safe' count for lumbar puncture. It is likely that lower platelet counts may also be safe but there is insufficient published evidence to make recommendations for lower levels at this stage&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/involvement-of-the-central-nervous-system-with-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Up to 40 mL of fluid can safely be removed if needed. CSF should be sent for cell count and differential, protein and glucose concentrations, gram stain and culture (if infection is suspected), cytology (examination of stained cytospin slides) and flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry if needed to identify blasts that cannot be characterized with certainty by morphology.

Most patients have moderate elevations in CSF protein with a moderate decrease in glucose. Some patients with clinical signs of cranial nerve involvement or masses demonstrated by imaging studies can have relatively benign appearing CSF without detectable blasts, but treatment should not be delayed in such patients. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.) </p><p>After the administration of intrathecal therapy, cytocentrifuge preparations can demonstrate reactive ependymal cells that, particularly if the leukocyte count is low, can be difficult to distinguish from leukemic cells. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging studies used to evaluate a patient with suspected CNS involvement of AML are selected based upon the symptoms.

Most of the evidence comes from clinical experience, retrospective analyses, and the extrapolation of data from other types of carcinomatous meningitis.</p><p>For patients with involvement of the CNS with AML without signs of cranial nerve impairment, we suggest initial treatment with intrathecal chemotherapy rather than cranial radiation or systemic chemotherapy designed to penetrate the blood brain barrier. This preference is largely based upon the known ability of intrathecal chemotherapy to clear cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) involvement in most patients relatively quickly and a desire to avoid the potential acute and long-term complications of cranial irradiation. Radiation therapy is administered in addition to intrathecal chemotherapy for patients with cranial nerve involvement or with a tumor mass that impinges on important structures (eg, the spinal cord). Radiation therapy may also be given to patients who fail to respond completely to intrathecal chemotherapy.</p><p>Patients who develop CNS and systemic relapse simultaneously require both CNS directed therapy and systemic chemotherapy. However, even when there is no evidence of systemic relapse, systemic disease will inevitably develop if systemic therapy is not delivered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrathecal chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy involves the injection of chemotherapy into the CSF, either directly into the lateral ventricle through a subcutaneous reservoir and ventricular catheter (eg, an Ommaya reservoir) or into the lumbar thecal sac by lumbar puncture (LP). If possible, CSF pressures should be measured in patients receiving therapy in the lumbar space. As fluid is removed, many patients will have a rapid relief of symptoms that were related to increased intracranial pressure.</p><p>An Ommaya reservoir is often placed, either because of difficulties in performing repeated lumbar punctures or because of concern that the CSF flow does not deliver sufficient amounts of the drug from the lumbar space to the entire CNS in some individuals. Typically, the flow of CSF is from the choroid plexus in the lateral ventricles down through the aqueduct to the base of the spine and then back up along the spinal cord until it is reabsorbed over the surface of the brain. Usually the dose of chemotherapy is reduced when given directly into the ventricles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65446\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65446 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>There have been no prospective trials comparing chemotherapy agents in this setting. Either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dose</span> when administered via an LP or 12 mg when administered via an Ommaya) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dose</span> via LP or 40 mg via Ommaya) can be used as the initial IT chemotherapy in an adult with a planned crossover to the other agent in the event of refractory disease or relapse. Young children may need a dose calculated on body weight.</p><p>A typical schedule includes treatment two to three times per week until the CSF has cleared of leukemic cells, generally occurring after a few injections. Treatment is then given at weekly intervals for two more doses, to be followed by monthly administration, for a total of one year.

Careful attention must be paid to minimizing any change in CSF volume. Thus, equivalent volumes of CSF (usually 7 to 10 mL) should be removed prior to instilling IT chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Methotrexate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrathecal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) is administered at a fixed dose of 15 mg (12 mg if administered via Ommaya), initially two to three times weekly.

We generally reserve radiation therapy (RT) for patients with cranial nerve involvement (CNI) or with a tumor mass that impinges on important structures (eg, the spinal cord) or for patients who fail to respond completely to intrathecal chemotherapy. Failure should be suspected if the CSF does not clear after four to five injections or if there are increasing numbers of blasts with or without worsening symptoms. Usually, an alternative intrathecal chemotherapy agent is attempted prior to adding external beam RT.</p><p>To avoid excess myelosuppression, cranial rather than craniospinal RT is preferred. It is important that the treatment field include the base of the brain (typically down to C2) in order to adequately cover the foramina for the cranial nerves. Patients with lower extremity weakness, or bladder or bowel dysfunction, may receive lumbosacral spine irradiation in addition to cranial irradiation, particularly if an MRI demonstrates nerve involvement at this level.</p><p>For patients with CNI or a tumor mass that impinges on important structures, we suggest initial RT rather than intrathecal chemotherapy alone. We initiate RT (18 to 25 Gy for the brain) as soon as CNI is suspected because the effect of intrathecal therapy alone on CNI is unpredictable and the chance of nerve recovery decreases substantially the longer the deficit has been present. Magnetic resonance imaging can be helpful in confirming the presence of CNI, but treatment should not be delayed if there is a strong clinical suspicion and the imaging study cannot be obtained expeditiously.</p><p>While cranial radiation is an effective form of CNS-directed therapy, its use is limited by acute and long-term toxicities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/involvement-of-the-central-nervous-system-with-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>].

Long-term toxicities include secondary neoplasms, endocrine diseases, neurocognitive dysfunction, neurotoxic effects, and growth retardation in children.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed complications of cranial irradiation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The efficacy of cranial RT for the treatment of CNS leukemia was assessed in a single-center retrospective study of 163 adults with CNS leukemia treated between 1996 and 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/involvement-of-the-central-nervous-system-with-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Sixty-six patients had AML and some received concurrent intrathecal treatment with chemotherapy. The most common CNS-related symptoms were headache (49 percent), cranial nerve VII deficit (28 percent), and cranial nerve II deficit (27 percent). Following RT, symptoms were resolved in 16 percent, improved in 54 percent, and stable in 15 percent. Patients received either whole brain, craniospinal, or base of skull ports. The doses administered were not mentioned. Because it is not clear how a particular port was chosen for individual patients, it is not possible to draw conclusions about which ports are appropriate for different clinical presentations. The median survival after radiation was 3.8 months. These results suggest that cranial RT often relieves symptoms, but is not sufficient treatment by itself.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic chemotherapy that penetrates the CNS can serve as an adjunct to intrathecal treatment. High dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> have been reported to achieve clearance of the CNS tumor load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/involvement-of-the-central-nervous-system-with-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18</a>]. Unfortunately, the relapse rate, even after initially rapidly successful therapy, is high, either in association with bone marrow relapse or independently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/involvement-of-the-central-nervous-system-with-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with ocular involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct involvement of the eye or vitreous is uncommon in AML.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

The incidence of CNS involvement is higher at the time of relapse of AML. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Routine evaluation of the CNS is not recommended for asymptomatic adult patients and children (&gt;1 year old) with AML. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">All infants (&le;1 year old) with a diagnosis of AML and adults with acute promyelocytic leukemia in second remission should undergo routine evaluation of the CNS because of the higher incidence of CNS involvement. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with CNS involvement are usually symptomatic, but may be asymptomatic. The great majority of asymptomatic patients with AML do not have CNS involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If CNS involvement is suspected, evaluation should include a lumbar puncture. The diagnosis of CNS leukemia is confirmed by the identification of leukemic blasts on cytocentrifuge preparations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Flow cytometry <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> molecular genetic analysis can confirm the presence of malignant cells, if diagnostic abnormalities are present. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Imaging studies are selected based upon the nature of symptoms present. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of CNS leukemia consists of the administration of intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy, with the addition of cranial radiation in patients who do not respond fully to chemotherapy, or in whom cranial nerve involvement is present. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with involvement of the CNS with AML, we suggest initial treatment with IT chemotherapy rather than cranial radiation or systemic chemotherapy that can penetrate the blood brain barrier (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a>, depending upon the site of administration, can be used as the initial IT chemotherapy with crossover to the other agent in the event of refractory disease or relapse. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Intrathecal chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with cranial nerve involvement or a tumor mass that impinges on important structures, we suggest initial radiation therapy (18 to 25 Gy for the brain) followed by IT chemotherapy rather than IT chemotherapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
