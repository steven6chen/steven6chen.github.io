It articulates with the patella, tibia and fibula distally to form the knee joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78385\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78385 \">figure 3</a>). The distal femur is made up of the medial and lateral epicondyles, the medial and lateral condyles and the trochlea. It contains the distal femoral metaphysis, physis, and epiphysis.</p><p>The distal femoral epiphysis ossifies at 36 weeks gestation in normally developing children, and is present at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/6,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,15</a>]. It is the largest and fastest growing physis in the body contributing 70 percent of femur growth and 40 percent of overall lower extremity growth. It closes between 14 and 16 years of age in girls and 16 to 18 years of age in boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Several important muscles and ligaments of the lower extremities have their proximal insertion sites on the distal femur: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The heads of both the gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles attach on the posterior distal femoral metaphysis, just proximal to the physis.

Excessive varus (force applied medially to move the joint away from midline) or valgus stress (force applied laterally to move the joint toward from midline) is absorbed by the collateral ligaments and transferred to the distal femoral physis. In growing children, the ligaments are stronger than the bones and this force will result in injury to the physis without injury to the collateral ligaments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/6,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,15</a>]. Alternatively, the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) both attach to the distal femoral epiphysis and can be injured with a distal femoral epiphyseal or physeal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/2,6,8,9,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,8,9,16</a>].</p><p/><p>The popliteal fossa is an important anatomic landmark as it contains key neurovascular structures that can be injured following distal femur fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83190\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83190 \">picture 1</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The femoral artery travels just above the distal femoral metaphysis and then courses posteriorly behind the popliteal fossa. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The popliteal artery runs directly posterior to and trifurcates at the distal femur, making it prone to injuries with displaced fractures, most often with hyperextension injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The knee has poor surrounding collateral circulation, so a popliteal artery injury is important to diagnosis and management since it can result in loss of limb viability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The posterior tibial nerve lies adjacent to the popliteal artery.

They can be initially undiagnosed until callous formation becomes apparent two to three weeks after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infants and toddlers </strong>&ndash; For infants and toddlers, high-energy falls and child abuse remain the leading causes of distal femur fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/6,11,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,17</a>]. Femur fractures in children too young to walk independently should heighten awareness for abusive injury, particularly &ldquo;corner fractures&rdquo; of the distal femur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79186\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79186 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83116\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83116 \">image 4</a>). &ldquo;Corner fractures&rdquo; represent Salter-Harris type II fractures in which the corners of the metaphysis are displaced from the rest of the metaphyseal flare. These fractures are highly suggestive of child abuse.

For example, when a valgus-type force is applied directly to the lateral side of the distal femur, as with football injuries, it generally results in a Salter-Harris Type II or III fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83180\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83180 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16</a>]. Anterior cruciate ligament tears can occur in association with Salter-Harris III fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Alternatively, a hyperextension injury of the distal femur can result in the anterior displacement of the epiphyses. In this situation, the proximal fracture fragment can be driven posterior into the popliteal fossa where it can damage popliteal vessels and the common peroneal or posterior tibial nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10435807\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES AND EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of a distal femur fracture will usually be suspected based on the history of a high-energy mechanism with physical examination findings of pain and swelling around the distal femur and knee (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83181\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83181 \">picture 2</a>). Patients with distal femur fractures will often be in severe pain and unable to bear weight. Associated hamstring muscle spasms will cause the knee to be flexed with resultant obvious knee deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The skin may be bruised indicating location of direct force.

The frequency and timing of follow-up is determined by the treating surgeon based upon several factors including patient age, whether closed reduction alone was performed, and the type of operative repair. Significant healing of distal femur fractures usually occurs by six weeks of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. As such, treatment by casting, splinting, traction or external fixation rarely exceeds this time frame. </p><p>All patients with femur fractures have early limitations to their mobility. Physical therapy is required in patients who are old enough to navigate with crutches or a walker. A wheelchair is provided for all patients to facilitate longer distances. Once ambulatory, physical therapy is rarely necessary. Full weightbearing, with rare exception, is expected by six weeks after initiation of treatment.</p><p>Patients with injuries to the growth plate require monitoring for at least one year after surgery for the development of growth arrest. Patients with growth arrest require longer follow-up care. Injuries away from the growth plate are typically resolved by 6 to 12 months after injury. </p><p>For children treated with internal or external fixation, early mobilization is facilitated by a physical therapist prior to discharge from the hospital, but typically physical therapy is not required subsequently. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10435772\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a rule, complications in the treatment of pediatric femur fractures are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. Many undesired outcomes can be overcome through the resiliency of childhood and growth. Complications from femur fractures can be broken down into two general categories: perioperative and remote. Perioperative complications are those encountered early and are associated with the significant energy required to result in a femur fracture. Remote complications are most common with physeal fractures. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Perioperative</strong> &ndash; Perioperative complications include neurovascular injury, compartment syndrome and infection. They are often associated with higher energy trauma such as motor vehicle accidents and falls from extreme heights. Nerve injuries are often transient, but if severe enough can result in permanent nerve palsy. Vascular injuries warrant further evaluation with angiography or Doppler studies, and require urgent treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The presence of vascular compromise necessitates exploration and skeletal fixation. Infection can occur with operative fixation, and typically presents approximately a week postoperatively with erythema, drainage from the operative site, and fever, but can be delayed by several weeks (low grade infections may manifest as nonunion, months after initial treatment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stiffness </strong>&ndash; Most children have early stiffness of the knee as a result of these injuries, particularly when treated in a cast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This stiffness typically resolves spontaneously over time. Most children recover full range of motion without formal intervention. Physical therapy may be a useful adjunct in recalcitrant cases of stiffness, or in patients where more rapid return to sports is desired.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Growth arrest and leg-length discrepancy</strong> &ndash; Growth disturbance and subsequent leg-length discrepancies or angular deformity are common remote complications after distal physeal femoral fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 16 series encompassing 564 pediatric distal femur fractures, 50 percent of distal femoral fractures involving the growth plate developed growth disturbance and 22 percent resulted in a leg-length discrepancy &gt;1.5 cm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Minor discrepancies in length, rotation and angular deformity from malunion are generally well tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. In younger children, these abnormalities often resolve spontaneously with growth, due to their proximity to the growth plate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In the case of symptomatic angular deformity, corrective osteotomy is an effective treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. When this is due to partial physeal arrest, bar resection may be required as well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For predicted leg-length difference at maturity of less than 2 cm, shoe inserts (or nothing) are the recommended treatment of choice. For predicted differences of 2 to 5 cm, contralateral epiphysiodesis (growth plate obliteration) can be performed prior to reaching skeletal maturity, resulting in equalization of leg-lengths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. If the child has already reached skeletal maturity, then femoral shortening with intramedullary fixation is the recommended treatment of choice. Patients with a predicted leg-length difference greater than 5 cm are typically treated with femoral lengthening via distraction osteogenesis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Non-union</strong> &ndash; Non-union in children is very uncommon, especially in the metaphyseal bone of the distal femur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/distal-femoral-fractures-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. It is typically associated with infections or cases in which significant soft tissue injury or bone loss has occurred. Evaluation for infection should always occur in the face of fracture nonunion, including cultures of blood and bone and measurement of inflammatory markers such as white blood cell count, C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In most instances, open treatment with curettage of fibrous nonunion and bone grafting with either autograft (gold standard) or demineralized bone matrix are warranted.
