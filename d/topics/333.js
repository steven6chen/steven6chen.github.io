Damage to cardiac valves may be chronic and progressive, resulting in cardiac decompensation.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of ARF are reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of this disorder are presented separately.

The possible major and minor manifestations are reviewed here. These manifestations are used for diagnosis (Revised Jones Criteria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The diagnostic criteria are reviewed below. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The five major manifestations (and percent of patients with each) are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carditis and valvulitis (eg, pancarditis) that is clinical or subclinical &ndash; 50 to 70 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthritis (usually migratory polyarthritis predominantly involving the large joints) &ndash; 35 to 66 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central nervous system involvement (eg, Sydenham chorea) &ndash; 10 to 30 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subcutaneous nodules &ndash; 0 to 10 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythema marginatum &ndash; &lt;6 percent</p><p/><p>The four minor manifestations are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthralgia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP])</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged PR interval on electrocardiogram</p><p/><p>There are two primary forms of presentation for ARF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F111437\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111437 \">table 1</a>). The more common form (approximately 70 to 75 percent of patients) is an acute febrile illness with joint manifestations and often carditis. The less common form is a <span class=\"nowrap\">neurologic/behavioral</span> disorder with Sydenham chorea. Joint manifestations are usually absent, and carditis, when present, is often subclinical.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1205759150\"><span class=\"h3\">Major manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major manifestations of ARF include arthritis, carditis, Sydenham chorea, subcutaneous nodules, and erythema marginatum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">Arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arthritis usually is the earliest symptomatic manifestation of ARF, generally presenting within 21 days of GAS infection, although asymptomatic carditis may develop first. It is more common and more severe in teenagers and young adults than in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Joint pain typically is more prominent than objective signs of inflammation and is almost always transient. However, the arthritis may be severe enough to severely limit movement.</p><p>Generally, the inflammation affects several joints in quick succession, and each joint is inflamed for a day or two to a week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists are most commonly affected, with the leg joints typically involved first. The onset of arthritis in different joints usually overlaps, giving the appearance that the disease &quot;migrates&quot; from joint to joint. Thus, the terms &quot;migrating&quot; or &quot;migratory&quot; are used to describe the polyarthritis of ARF, and it is also regarded as an additive polyarthritis. The arthritis resolves without treatment in approximately four weeks, and there is no long-term joint deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The natural history of arthritis in ARF is altered by empiric treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or glucocorticoids. In such cases, arthritis subsides quickly in the joint(s) affected and does not &quot;migrate&quot; to new joints. The diagnosis of ARF should be reconsidered if joint symptoms do not respond to NSAID treatment within 48 hours.</p><p>Patients treated with NSAIDs early in the course of ARF, particularly before the other signs and symptoms of ARF become distinct, may appear to have monoarthritis rather than polyarthritis. As an example, involvement of a single large joint was common in one series of patients with ARF who were treated for associated arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In another series including 555 Aboriginal patients in Australia, aseptic monoarticular arthritis was also described in 17 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The presence of monoarthritis rather than polyarthritis can make it difficult to establish the diagnosis of ARF and determine the need for secondary ARF prophylaxis. Commencement of NSAID therapy can be delayed if the diagnosis of ARF is suspected but only a single joint is involved, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> used for analgesia in the meantime, since there is no evidence that temporarily withholding such therapy has any adverse effects. NSAIDs may be commenced once a second joint is involved and the diagnosis is clear.</p><p>Radiography of an affected joint may demonstrate a slight effusion but is usually unremarkable. Thus, radiographic evaluation of affected joints is not routinely performed. Joint aspiration and synovial fluid evaluation, including culture, is indicated if there is significant effusion of one joint or septic arthritis is suspected. Analysis of the synovial fluid generally demonstrates sterile inflammatory fluid in patients with ARF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Carditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The carditis associated with ARF is classically considered to be a pancarditis that can involve the pericardium, epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. While myocarditis and pericarditis may occur in ARF, the predominant manifestation of carditis is involvement of the endocardium presenting as a valvulitis, especially of the mitral and aortic valves. It usually presents within three weeks of GAS infection. The presence of valvulitis is established by auscultatory findings together with echocardiographic evidence of mitral or aortic regurgitation. The Carey Coombs murmur, a short mid-diastolic murmur heard loudest at the apex, is an indicator of moderate-severe mitral regurgitation as a result of increased blood flow across the mitral valve during left ventricular filling. Subclinical carditis can be diagnosed by <span class=\"nowrap\">echocardiography/Doppler</span> studies that reveal mitral or aortic regurgitation in the absence of ausculatory findings (either because the clinical exam findings are absent or are not recognized). Damage to cardiac valves may be progressive and chronic, resulting in cardiac decompensation. Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of carditis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease#H16376507\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease&quot;, section on 'Rheumatic carditis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease#H3671887655\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis of rheumatic carditis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease#H10512862\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease&quot;, section on 'Transition from acute to chronic disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease#H23709418\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease&quot;, section on 'Chronic valve disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Sydenham chorea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sydenham chorea (also known as chorea minor or &quot;St. Vitus dance&quot;) is a neurologic disorder consisting of abrupt, nonrhythmic, involuntary movements, muscular weakness, and emotional disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Chorea has a longer latent period than other rheumatic manifestations, typically presenting one to eight months after a GAS infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and may occur as an isolated finding. It is more common in girls and may present as refusal to go to school and self-isolation due to shame and embarrassment. Recurrence of rheumatic chorea is not uncommon, sometimes associated with pregnancy or the oral contraceptive pill. Most patients with Sydenham chorea recover fully within six weeks and nearly all within six months, with only rare cases described lasting longer than that. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sydenham-chorea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sydenham chorea&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The choreiform movements frequently are more marked on one side, are occasionally unilateral (hemichorea), and cease during sleep. The movements may be subtle and intermittent, sometimes only seen after a 10- to 15-minute period of quiet observation. Muscle weakness is best demonstrated by asking the patient to squeeze the examiner's hands. The pressure of the patient's grip increases and decreases capriciously, a phenomenon known as relapsing grip or &quot;milk maid's sign.&quot; The head is often involved, with erratic movements of the face that resemble grimaces, grins, and frowns. The tongue, if affected, can resemble a &quot;bag of worms&quot; when protruded, and protrusion cannot be maintained. Chorea disappears with sleep and is made more pronounced by purposeful movements. Diffuse hypotonia may be present. Neurologic examination fails to reveal sensory losses or involvement of the pyramidal tract.</p><p>Emotional changes manifest with outbursts of inappropriate behavior including crying and restlessness. Some patients have features of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Halting and jerky speech patterns are also sometimes seen. In rare cases, psychologic manifestations are severe and may result in transient psychosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Erythema marginatum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Erythema marginatum is an evanescent, pink or faintly red, nonpruritic rash involving the trunk and sometimes the limbs but not the face [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. When present, it usually occurs early in the course of ARF, but, in some cases, the lesions are first noticed late in the illness or even during convalescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In some instances, it persists or recurs after all other manifestations have resolved. Erythema marginatum most commonly occurs in patients with acute carditis but has been reported in patients with chronic carditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It rarely occurs as the sole manifestation of ARF.</p><p>The lesion extends centrifugally, with return of the skin in the center to a normal appearance. The outer edge of the lesion is sharp; the inner edge is diffuse. The lesion is also known as &quot;erythema annulare&quot; since the margin of the lesion is usually continuous, making a ring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F50841\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50841 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F71804\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71804 \">picture 2</a>). Individual lesions may appear, disappear, and reappear in a matter of hours. A hot bath or shower may make them more evident.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h4\">Subcutaneous nodules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subcutaneous nodules in ARF are firm, painless lesions ranging from a few millimeters to 2 cm in size. They are smaller and shorter lived than the nodules of rheumatoid arthritis. Subcutaneous nodules associated with ARF generally appear after the first weeks of illness, usually in patients with relatively severe carditis. They rarely appear as the only manifestation of ARF. Typically, nodules are present for one or more weeks, but they rarely persist for more than a month.</p><p>The nodules are usually located over a bony surface or prominence or near tendons (usually extensor surfaces) and are usually symmetric. The elbows are involved most frequently in both ARF and rheumatoid arthritis. However, ARF nodules occur most commonly on the olecranon, whereas rheumatoid nodules are usually found 3 to 4 cm distally. The overlying skin is not inflamed and usually can be moved over the nodules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F54984\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54984 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The number of nodules varies from a single lesion to a few dozen; the average number is three to four.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14473114\"><span class=\"h3\">Minor manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The minor manifestations of ARF include fever, arthralgia, elevated ESR and CRP, and prolonged PR interval on electrocardiogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fever </strong>&ndash; Fever associated with ARF is usually &ge;38.5&deg;C orally (101.3&deg;F). However, low-grade fever (&ge;38&deg;C [100.4&deg;F]) is more common in high-risk groups, such as the Indigenous Australian population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Arthralgia</strong> &ndash; Arthralgia usually involves several joints (polyarthralgia) when it occurs in patients with ARF. However, it is a common manifestation in many other rheumatologic disorders and therefore is highly nonspecific.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Elevated acute phase reactants </strong>&ndash; Acute phase reactants are almost always elevated in patients with ARF, except in some patients with isolated chorea or in those treated with antirheumatic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Typical elevations of acute phase reactants seen in ARF include an ESR &ge;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour</span> and CRP &ge;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. As with fever, lower levels (ie, ESR &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour)</span> can be seen in high-risk groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prolonged PR interval on electrocardiogram</strong> &ndash; Interpretation of PR prolongation depends upon age and heart rate and is &gt;0.2 seconds in adults. It is important to note that up to one-third of children with uncomplicated streptococcal infections have a prolonged PR interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Abnormal atrioventricular conduction is common in ARF, with first degree block the most common abnormality observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Severe first-degree block can occasionally lead to a junctional rhythm, and second-degree and complete heart block can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3040383126\"><span class=\"h3\">Additional features</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Family history</strong> &ndash; A family history of ARF should heighten the suspicion for ARF in the setting of suggestive features.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other findings</strong> &ndash; Other clinical features seen in patients with ARF include abdominal pain, precordial pain, malaise, epistaxis, rapid sleeping pulse rate, and tachycardia out of proportion to fever. Laboratory findings include leukocytosis and mild normochromic, normocytic anemia of chronic inflammation. Complement levels are usually normal in ARF. In contrast, hypocomplementemia is typically observed in the setting of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Late sequelae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is the most common and severe sequela of ARF. Jaccoud arthropathy is a rare complication associated with recurrent episodes of ARF with polyarthritis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100642828\"><span class=\"h3\">Rheumatic heart disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RHD usually occurs 10 to 20 years after the original illness, although it may present earlier after a severe or recurrent episode of ARF. It is the most common cause of acquired valvular disease in the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The mitral valve is more commonly involved than the aortic valve, and mitral regurgitation is the most common finding of RHD. This may progress to mitral stenosis in severe cases due to fibrosis and calcification of the mitral valve. In general, valvular damage manifesting as a murmur later in life occurs in approximately 50 percent of patients who had carditis during the initial episode of ARF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. RHD is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100642846\"><span class=\"h3\">Jaccoud arthropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Jaccoud arthropathy is a benign, chronic arthropathy that involves loosening and lengthening of periarticular structures and tendons in the hands <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> feet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F105695\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105695 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The deformities are painless, &quot;correctable&quot; with manipulation, and do not cause functional impairment. The arthropathy is not associated with active joint inflammation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ARF is characterized by group A streptococcal (GAS) infection followed by the clinical manifestations outlined above (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Acute illness'</a> above). The diagnosis of ARF is established on clinical grounds using the 2015 Jones Criteria, which are stratified based upon whether the patient is from a low-risk or a moderate- to high-risk population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The diagnostic evaluation includes studies to establish the diagnosis of GAS infection, evaluate acute phase reactants, and assess cardiac function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100642919\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial description of clinical manifestations in 1944, known as the Jones Criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>], was used by the American Heart Association (AHA) to establish guidelines for the diagnosis of ARF. These guidelines have been modified over time, most recently in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,26,27</a>].</p><p>The 2015 revision of the criteria provides two different sets of criteria: one for low-risk populations (ie, those with a rheumatic fever incidence &le;2 per 100,000 school-aged children per year or all-age rheumatic heart disease [RHD] prevalence &le;1 per 1000 population) and one for moderate- to high-risk populations.</p><p>The major and minor manifestations included in the Jones Criteria are reviewed above (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Acute illness'</a> above).

It may be difficult to establish a diagnosis of acute carditis during an acute attack in the absence of pericarditis or involvement of a new valve. Thus, a presumptive diagnosis of recurrent ARF may be made with one major or two minor criteria if there is evidence of a recent GAS infection. Caution against using a single clinical finding (eg, monoarthritis, fever, arthralgia) as a criterion for the diagnosis of recurrent disease is suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100642996\"><span class=\"h3\">Moderate/high-risk populations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strict adherence to the Jones Criteria in areas of higher prevalence (defined as ARF incidence &gt;2 per 100,000 school-aged children per year or all-age RHD prevalence of &gt;1 per 1000 population) may result in under-diagnosis. This was illustrated in a report of 555 cases of confirmed ARF among Aboriginal Australians in whom monoarthritis and low-grade fever were important manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Polyarthralgia should only be considered as a major manifestation after exclusion of other causes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The minor criterion for joint involvement is monoarthralgia rather than polyarthralgia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lower cutoff for fever is used (&ge;38&deg;C [100.4&deg;F] rather than &ge;38.5&deg;C [101.3&deg;F]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lower cutoff for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is used (&ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour</span> rather than &ge;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour),</span> although the C-reactive protein (CRP) cutoff is unchanged (&ge;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100643063\"><span class=\"h2\">Evidence of preceding GAS infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Confirmation of group A streptococcal (GAS) infection is helpful but not necessary to make the diagnosis of ARF. A high index of suspicion of ARF is important, particularly in children or young adults presenting with signs of arthritis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> carditis, even in the absence of a documented episode of pharyngitis. Laboratory confirmation is required because the clinical documentation of an antecedent pharyngitis is unreliable and has an age-related variability. One study, for example, noted that the recollection of pharyngitis approached 70 percent in older children and young adults versus only 20 percent in younger children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In one Australian study, a recent sore throat (suggestive of streptococcal pharyngitis) was reported in 30 percent (39 of 131) of Indigenous children with ARF, whereas it was reported in 55 percent (10 of 20) of non-Indigenous children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>Therefore, evidence of prior GAS infection may be sought in one of the following ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive throat culture for group A beta-hemolytic streptococci</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive rapid streptococcal antigen test</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated or rising antistreptococcal antibody titer &ndash; Either antistreptolysin O (ASO) or antideoxyribonuclease B (ADB)</p><p/><p>Streptococcal serology is most helpful in the diagnosis of ARF because of the delayed nature of the disease following GAS infection. Antibody titers are elevated, while culture or detection of the organism is usually no longer possible by the time ARF presents. Throat cultures are negative in approximately 75 percent of patients by the time manifestations of ARF appear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The rapid streptococcal antigen test is also commonly negative.</p><p>During an infection with GAS, there is a broad immune response to multiple cellular antigens. However, measurement of the antibody response to streptolysin O <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> deoxyribonuclease B is used most in clinical practice.</p><p>Antistreptococcal antibodies have a high sensitivity for the documentation of streptococcal infection in the setting of ARF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Titers vary with age, season, and geography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], but published normal values are available for children in the US and children in tropical settings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F109547\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109547 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F109548\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109548 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Healthy children of elementary school age often have titers of 200 to 300 Todd <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> because GAS tonsillopharyngitis is common in this age group, whereas older children and adults who are asymptomatic pharyngeal GAS carriers tend to have low titers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>ASO and ADB titers may be interpreted either by comparison of acute with convalescent titers or against a reference upper limit of normal (ULN). An increase in titer from acute to convalescent (at least two weeks apart) is considered the best evidence of antecedent GAS infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The antibody response of ASO peaks at approximately three to five weeks following GAS pharyngitis, which usually is during the first to third week of ARF, while ADB titers peak at six to eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Antibody titers fall off rapidly in the next several months and, after six months, have a slower decline. For these reasons, it may be useful to collect one specimen when the diagnosis of ARF is first suspected and another two weeks later.</p><p>Approximately 80 percent of patients with documented ARF demonstrate a rise in ASO titer above the ULN value for age, defined by the 80<sup>th</sup> centile, although this cannot be used as a measure of rheumatic activity. In a study in Australia, diagnosis of poststreptococcal syndromes using an ULN value for ASO had a sensitivity of 73 percent, but the sensitivity increased to &gt;95 percent when ADB was added to ASO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In the center of one author (AS), an ASO titer is measured first, and, if negative, measurement of ADB is added.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100643075\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory studies obtained during the initial evaluation include measurement of CRP or ESR to seek evidence of systemic inflammation and a complete blood count with differential to look for anemia and leukocytosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100643069\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrocardiogram and echocardiogram are performed as part of the initial screening.

This disorder has been called poststreptococcal reactive arthritis (PSRA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/42-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-47</a>]. However, an unusual clinical course should not be sufficient to exclude the diagnosis of ARF. Migratory arthritis without evidence of other major Jones Criteria, if supported by two minor manifestations, must still be considered ARF, especially in children. Defining this reactive arthritis as an ARF variant has important implications for secondary prophylactic treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-arthritis#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive arthritis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The following observations have been used to support the notion that PSRA is a separate disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The latent period between the antecedent streptococcal infection and the onset of migratory arthritis is shorter (one to two weeks) than the two to three weeks usually seen in classic ARF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The response of the arthritis to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and other nonsteroidal medications is poor in comparison to the dramatic response seen in classic ARF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of carditis is not seen in these patients, and the severity of the arthritis is quite marked.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extra-articular manifestations, such as tenosynovitis and renal abnormalities, often are seen in these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute phase reactants (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP]) tend to be lower than in the setting of ARF.</p><p/><p>However, these patients may actually have ARF, with the above observations being explained by other genetic or environmental factors. As an example, variations in the response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> in affected adults may be caused by variations in salicylate levels. Even when patients with PSRA do not fulfill the Jones Criteria, some investigators regard it as a <em>forme fruste</em> of rheumatic fever requiring similar secondary prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Both the 1992 guidelines and the 2002 update reached the following conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/25,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,32</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the relationship between PSRA and ARF remains unresolved, patients who fulfill the Jones Criteria should be considered to have ARF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients who do not fulfill the Jones Criteria, the diagnosis of PSRA should be made only after excluding other rheumatic diseases such as Lyme disease and rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p/><p>Treatment of poststreptococcal reactive arthritis is discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The five major manifestations (major Jones Criteria) of ARF are migratory arthritis (predominantly involving the large joints), carditis and valvulitis (eg, pancarditis), central nervous system involvement (eg, Sydenham chorea), erythema marginatum, and subcutaneous nodules. The four minor manifestations (minor Jones Criteria) are arthralgia, fever, elevated acute phase reactants, and prolonged PR interval on electrocardiogram. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Acute illness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of ARF is established on clinical grounds. The probability of ARF is high in the setting of GAS infection followed by two major criteria or one major and two minor criteria. The criteria are modified slightly for patients in moderate- to high-risk populations. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthritis usually is the earliest symptomatic manifestation of ARF. The natural history consists of inflammation affecting several joints in quick succession with overlapping onset, giving the appearance that the disease &quot;migrates&quot; from joint to joint. Joint pain usually is more prominent than objective signs of inflammation and is almost always transient. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Arthritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ARF causes a pancarditis, affecting the pericardium, epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium, with valvulitis being the most common clinical presentation. However, the carditis can be subclinical. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Carditis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sydenham chorea (also known as chorea minor or &quot;St. Vitus dance&quot;) is a neurologic disorder consisting of abrupt, nonrhythmic, involuntary movements; muscular weakness; and emotional disturbances. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Sydenham chorea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythema marginatum is an evanescent, pink or faintly red, nonpruritic rash involving the trunk and sometimes the limbs but not the face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F50841\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50841 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F71804\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71804 \">picture 2</a>). The lesion extends centrifugally, with return of the skin in the center to a normal appearance. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Erythema marginatum'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subcutaneous nodules are firm, painless lesions ranging from a few millimeters to 2 cm in size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F54984\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54984 \">picture 3</a>). The nodules are usually located over a bony surface or prominence or near tendons (usually extensor surfaces) and are usually symmetric. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Subcutaneous nodules'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common sequela of ARF is rheumatic heart disease (RHD). RHD usually occurs 10 to 20 years after the original illness and is the most common cause of acquired valvular disease in the world. (See <a href=\"#H100642828\" class=\"local\">'Rheumatic heart disease'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some cases of arthritis occurring after a streptococcal infection are not accompanied by sufficient additional Jones Criteria to meet diagnostic requirements for ARF.
