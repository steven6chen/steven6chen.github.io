Adverse food reactions are common and may be secondary to food allergy or to a wide variety of other disorders.</p><p>This topic reviews the history and physical examination in patients with possible food allergy. The clinical manifestations and diagnostic testing modalities are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2214254\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adverse food reactions can be subdivided into allergic and nonallergic reactions. Food allergy (or hypersensitivity) is defined broadly as an immunologic reaction to food and can be further distinguished into immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated mechanisms and non-IgE-mediated mechanisms. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of food allergy in the United States define food allergy as &quot;an adverse health effect arising from a specific immune response that occurs reproducibly on exposure to a given food&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The history is of critical importance in the evaluation of a patient with possible food allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Primary goals of the history are to determine if food allergy could be present and, if so, what type and which food may be responsible. The history is subsequently used to guide testing and interpret results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Food allergy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Food allergy is due to an abnormal immunologic response following exposure (usually ingestion) to a food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. <strong>Allergy</strong> and <strong>hypersensitivity</strong> are used interchangeably in these sections to refer to these abnormal immunologic reactions. However, the term &quot;hypersensitivity&quot; is sometimes used more liberally in other literature to describe all exuberant adverse reactions to food, including lactose intolerance, for example [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>True food allergy appears to be present in only 6 to 8 percent of children and 3 to 4 percent of adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. Despite a relatively low prevalence, food allergy is the primary cause of anaphylaxis presenting to emergency departments and accounts for many outpatient visits following less severe reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-in-children-prevalence-natural-history-and-monitoring-for-resolution#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food allergy in children: Prevalence, natural history, and monitoring for resolution&quot;, section on 'Prevalence of childhood food allergy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-induced-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food-induced anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonimmunologic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonimmunologic adverse food reactions are far more common than food allergy and, as implied by the term, arise from nonimmunologic reactions to food ingestion. Examples include lactose intolerance, auriculotemporal syndrome (or Frey syndrome, a gustatory flushing appearing on the skin below the ear and along the jaw line), and disorders resulting from anatomic abnormalities, enzymatic deficiencies, metabolic diseases, toxins, gastrointestinal infections, and a host of other processes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F51225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51225 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of the history in evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical history is an essential component of the evaluation of a patient with possible food allergy. This topic review discusses how the history, supported by the physical exam, is used to accomplish specific goals:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distinguish food allergy from a host of other adverse food reactions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distinguish among different types of food allergy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify a possible culprit food</p><p/><p>The history is also used to determine what type of testing should be performed and how that testing is interpreted, particularly for IgE-mediated food allergy. An extremely important point is that a positive result on skin testing or in vitro testing indicates sensitization (IgE antibody specific for the tested food) and is not necessarily equivalent to a clinical allergy. The information obtained from the clinical history is used to assess the patient's pretest probability of having food allergy. Testing for specific allergic conditions is then performed and interpreted in the context of this assessment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF FOOD ALLERGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Food allergy can be subdivided into various types, depending upon the underlying pathogenic mechanism. A primary distinction is between food allergy caused by immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated mechanisms and food allergy caused by other immunologic mechanisms. This distinction is critical because IgE-mediated reactions may progress to life-threatening anaphylaxis and must be properly identified and managed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-induced-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food-induced anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IgE-mediated reactions are characterized by stereotypical signs and symptoms that develop rapidly following exposure (usually ingestion).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IgE-mediated food allergy presents with some combination of the following signs and symptoms: nausea; vomiting; cramping; diarrhea; flushing; pruritus; urticaria; swelling of the lips, face, or throat; wheezing; lightheadedness; or syncope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79448\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79448 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>A patient may present with only one or two of these symptoms or virtually all of them. In children, a classic presentation is vomiting and urticaria. In adults, reactions frequently involve urticaria, angioedema of the lips and face, and abdominal symptoms. Extragastrointestinal symptoms are common and may be the only symptoms present (eg, urticaria).</p><p>A more detailed discussion of the different presentations of IgE-mediated food allergy is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IgE-mediated reactions occur rapidly after ingestion of the culprit food (ie, within seconds to minutes). Uncommonly, reactions up to two hours and beyond can also occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Common culprit foods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IgE-mediated food allergy occurs most often in association with certain foods, although any food has the potential to cause allergy. In young children, 90 percent of IgE-mediated allergies are caused by cow's milk, egg, soy, peanut, wheat, tree nuts, and fish and shellfish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In adolescents and adults, the most common culprit foods causing systemic reactions are peanut, tree nuts, shellfish, and fish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Allergies to fresh fruits and vegetables are common but usually less severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-oral-allergy-syndrome-pollen-food-allergy-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of oral allergy syndrome (pollen-food allergy syndrome)&quot;</a>). Allergies to various seeds (sesame, poppy, canola) appear to be increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy/abstract/14,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Related allergic conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be questioned about symptoms of other allergic diseases, such as eczema (atopic dermatitis), allergic rhinitis, and asthma, as patients with these conditions are more likely to have food allergy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Other forms of food allergy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast with IgE-mediated disorders, food allergies caused by other mechanisms present with more subacute and chronic reactions. These disorders commonly affect the gastrointestinal tract <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> skin and are most frequent in infants and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of these food allergy disorders may involve antigen-antibody complex (Type III) and cell-mediated (Type IV) hypersensitivity, although solid evidence supporting these mechanisms is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. There are several groups of disorders that are classified as non-IgE or cell-mediated food allergy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, which are food related in some patients (particularly eosinophilic esophagitis in children)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dietary protein-induced disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Celiac disease and the associated skin disorder, dermatitis herpetiformis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atopic dermatitis, which is food related in some patients</p><p/><p>These conditions are rarely associated with severe acute reactions, with the important exception of dietary protein-induced enterocolitis of infancy, in which infants can develop dehydration, hypotension, and acidemia. Each of these disorders is presented in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eosinophilic-gastroenteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eosinophilic gastroenteritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of allergy in atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-IgE-mediated food allergies usually involve isolated gastrointestinal symptoms, such as reflux, nausea, vomiting, cramping, and diarrhea. These types of food allergies should also be considered in infants in the first year of life with varying degrees of blood and mucus in the stool.</p><p>Patients with these forms of food allergy usually appear well. An exception to this statement, as mentioned previously, is seen in the infantile syndrome of dietary protein-induced enterocolitis, in which infants can present with dehydration or failure to thrive and also develop severe hypotension upon food re-exposure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because the symptoms of non-IgE-mediated allergic disorders are nonspecific, the history and physical alone are rarely sufficient to distinguish them from nonallergic disorders unless they present as one of several, well-recognized syndromes. Gastroenterologic tests, including blood tests, stool examinations, endoscopy, colonoscopy, and mucosal biopsy, may be required for diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-IgE-mediated reactions have a subacute <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chronic course and generally present hours to days after the food is ingested. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC KEY QUESTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history is of critical importance in the evaluation of a patient with suspected food allergy. A primary goal is to determine if an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy is probable as this type of reaction can pose an immediate threat to the patient if undetected and can be identified by specific signs and symptoms in most cases. Eliciting or augmenting factors should also be sought [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The following specific questions should be asked when evaluating a patient for possible food allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy/abstract/1-3,19,24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,19,24-27</a>]:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Questions related to the suspected food allergen</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What particular food was suspected to have provoked the reaction? Peanut, tree nuts, shellfish, fish, milk, egg, wheat, and soy account for the majority of serious IgE-mediated food allergies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>It is more likely that a food eaten rarely is the trigger of an acute allergic reaction, rather than a food that is a routine component of the diet. Questions should be directed to disclose ingredients that are uncommon in the patient's diet.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The possibility that a known allergen for a patient is present as a &quot;contaminant,&quot; for example through cross-contact in preparation, should be considered in an individual with known food allergies who experiences a reaction associated with ingestion of a meal comprised of previously tolerated foods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much of the suspected food was ingested? IgE-mediated reactions can be triggered by minute amounts of food proteins. However, threshold doses required to trigger a reaction vary. Some individuals are less sensitive, and larger amounts of allergen must be ingested before a reaction occurs. Other disorders (eg, lactose intolerance) more typically require larger portions to induce symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What other foods were ingested at the time? Patients will typically recount the main dish or food eaten prior to a reaction. However, sauces, dressings, breads, beverages, and side dishes should also be reviewed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are all of the ingested ingredients known? There may be hidden ingredients in commercially processed foods that will only be apparent with review of labels. Processed foods also may be mislabeled or contain undeclared allergens. Packaged meat, egg, and poultry products are exempt from the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act. Food labels may be vague (eg &quot;natural flavorings&quot;). In some cases, the patient or clinician will need to contact the manufacturer to obtain more specific information. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-avoidance#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Avoidance&quot;, section on 'Food labeling'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How was the food prepared and served? Exposure to food allergens via cross-contact should be considered (eg, deep-fried food, food served in a buffet). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-avoidance#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Avoidance&quot;, section on 'Restaurant meals'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-food-allergy-avoidance#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of food allergy: Avoidance&quot;, section on 'Home-meal preparation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Questions related to symptoms</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What specific symptoms were involved? The patient should be questioned about systemic, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and respiratory symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Were any of the signs and symptoms of an IgE-mediated reaction present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79448\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79448 \">table 2</a>)? If present, an IgE-mediated allergy must be considered. If absent, other forms of food allergy or intolerance are more likely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did similar symptoms develop on other occasions when the food was eaten (ie, reproducibility)? IgE-mediated allergies cause symptoms with every ingestion, although there may be a threshold amount that is required. Was the food prepared in a different manner or consumed in much larger amounts? As examples, a patient may react to raw salmon in sushi but not to canned salmon or to scrambled egg but not egg in baked goods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has the patient reacted with cutaneous or inhalation exposure to the suspected food allergen? Contact urticaria upon exposure to raw or lightly cooked egg is common in children with egg allergy. Respiratory symptoms may develop upon inhalation of food allergens that are aerosolized during the cooking process. Some, but not all, food allergens are aerosolized during cooking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-manifestations-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory manifestations of food allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much time elapsed between ingestion of the food and the development of symptoms? Different types of food allergy have characteristic times to onset of symptoms. IgE-mediated reactions typically occur within minutes, whereas cell-mediated reactions are more indolent and may take several hours to days to manifest. One exception is that IgE-mediated allergic reactions to meat can be relatively delayed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-to-meats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergy to meats&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have a history of avoiding or refusing to eat the suspected food? Young children sometimes display dislike for, or refusal to ingest, foods that are later confirmed as allergens. This presumably occurs due to mild reactions that they experience when trying the food. Although young children are often picky eaters, attention should be paid to this behavior when allergies are suspected, especially when common allergenic foods (eg, peanut, egg) are rejected. However, an underlying eating disorder should be considered in patients who avoid or refuse to eat multiple foods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How was the reaction treated? Did it resolve spontaneously, or were medications administered that may have curtailed the development of other symptoms? How long were the medications continued, and were there any later symptoms?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Questions related to contributory factors</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Was the patient involved in exercise or other exertion in proximity to the reaction? Allergic reactions to food may only occur in some patients if there is <span class=\"nowrap\">exercise/exertion</span> just after ingestion or may be more severe with exertion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-induced-anaphylaxis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-induced anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Were any medications (including nonprescription anti-inflammatory medications) or alcohol ingested in proximity to the reaction? These agents are believed to increase the rate of allergen absorption. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-induced-anaphylaxis#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food-induced anaphylaxis&quot;, section on 'Factors affecting presentation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other variables between reactions that may influence severity? Phase in the menstrual cycle, occurrence during a pollen season, or climactic conditions (especially heat and humidity) are factors that influence reactions in a small number of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has the patient received a recent transfusion or undergone solid organ or bone marrow transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]? There are rare reports of patients acquiring food allergies following transfusion of a blood product [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>] or after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy/abstract/33-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-47</a>]. In the former case, the allergy is transient and is due to food-specific IgE in the blood product. In the latter case, the potential mechanism depends upon the type of transplant and can range from temporary allergy due to transferred activated mast <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/basophils</span> or allergen-specific IgE to longer-lasting or permanent allergy due to transfer of food allergen-specific lymphocytes or hematopoietic stem cells from the donor. Alternatively, an allergic reaction to a food can occur in an allergic patient after receiving a blood product that contains intact allergen consumed by the donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p/><p>Records of acute care provided on site, in emergency departments, or in urgent care clinics should be retrieved and reviewed if needed. These can provide documentation of key physical findings, such as flushing, urticaria, wheezing, tachycardia, or hypotension, of which patients themselves may not be aware.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination should focus on physical findings of allergic reactions if the patient is evaluated acutely or stigmata of allergic disease if the patient presents with chronic symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergic reactions are suggested by characteristic signs and symptoms, such as urticaria and angioedema, and respiratory, gastrointestinal, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiovascular symptoms that develop in minutes to an hour after food ingestion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79448\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79448 \">table 2</a>). Another important disorder that may present acutely with severe vomiting progressing to dehydration and hypotension, usually one to three hours after food ingestion, is dietary protein-induced enterocolitis, which is not associated with IgE antibodies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain symptoms of chronic disease should prompt consideration of food allergy as a cause or contributor. Atopic dermatitis is associated with food allergy in approximately 40 percent of <span class=\"nowrap\">infants/children</span> with moderate to severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Patients who display stigmata of other allergic diseases, such as allergic rhinitis (eg, &quot;allergic shiners,&quot; pale and swollen nasal mucosa) are more likely to have concomitant IgE-mediated food allergy.</p><p>Chronic gastrointestinal symptoms and failure to thrive can also be associated with food allergy in a subset of patients, usually <span class=\"nowrap\">infants/children</span>.

Food allergy (or hypersensitivity) is defined broadly as an immunologic reaction to food and can be further distinguished into immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated mechanisms and non-IgE-mediated mechanisms. IgE-mediated reactions may progress to life-threatening anaphylaxis and must be properly identified. (See <a href=\"#H2214254\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The history is of critical importance in the evaluation of a patient with possible food allergy. Primary goals of the history are to determine if food allergy may be present and, if so, what type of allergy and which food may be responsible. The history is subsequently used to guide testing and interpret results. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Role of the history in evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IgE-mediated reactions are characterized by stereotypical signs and symptoms that develop rapidly after food ingestion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79448\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79448 \">table 2</a>). Symptoms beyond the gastrointestinal tract are common and may be the only symptoms present (eg, urticaria). Combinations of the following signs and symptoms are typical: nausea; vomiting; cramping; diarrhea; flushing; pruritus; urticaria; swelling of the lips, face, or throat; wheezing; lightheadedness; or syncope. Although any food can cause IgE-mediated allergy, a few foods cause most of these reactions. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-IgE-mediated food allergies usually involve subacute or chronic symptoms that are isolated to the gastrointestinal tract, such as nausea, vomiting, cramping, and diarrhea. History is often not sufficient to distinguish them from nonallergic disorders unless they present as one of several well-recognized syndromes. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Other forms of food allergy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain questions are particularly useful for obtaining important information about food allergy. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Specific key questions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physical examination should focus on physical findings of allergic reactions if the patient is evaluated acutely or stigmata of allergic disease if the patient presents with chronic symptoms.
