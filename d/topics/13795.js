Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is frequently used interchangeably to include bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia, or any combination of the three. For the purposes of this review, pneumonia will be defined as a condition typically associated with fever, respiratory symptoms, and evidence of parenchymal involvement, either by physical examination or the presence of infiltrates on chest radiography.

The lower respiratory tract air spaces fill with white blood cells (WBC), fluid, and cellular debris. This process reduces lung compliance, increases resistance, obstructs smaller airways, and may result in collapse of distal air spaces, air trapping, and altered ventilation-perfusion relationships [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-in-children-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Severe infection is associated with necrosis of bronchial or bronchiolar epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-in-children-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulmonary parenchyma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-in-children-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Acquisition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The agents that cause lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) are most often transmitted by droplet spread resulting from close contact with a source case. Contact with contaminated fomites also may be important in the acquisition of viral agents, especially respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).</p><p>Most typical bacterial pneumonias are the result of initial colonization of the nasopharynx followed by aspiration or inhalation of organisms. Invasive disease most commonly occurs upon acquisition of a new serotype of the organism with which the patient has not had previous experience, typically after an incubation period of one to three days. Occasionally, a primary bacteremia may precede the pneumonia. Atypical bacterial pathogens attach to respiratory epithelial membranes through which they enter cells for replication.</p><p>The viral agents that cause pneumonia proliferate and spread by contiguity to involve lower and more distal portions of the respiratory tract.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal host defense</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pulmonary host defense system is complex and includes anatomic and mechanical barriers, humoral immunity, phagocytic activity, and cell-mediated immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-in-children-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>], as discussed below, with a focus on bacterial infection. The host response to respiratory viral infection is beyond the scope of this review; more information can be obtained from reference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-in-children-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anatomic and mechanical barriers &ndash; Anatomic and mechanical barriers in the upper airway form an important part of the host defense. Particles greater than 10 microns are efficiently filtered by the hairs in the anterior nares or impact onto mucosal surfaces. The nasal mucosa contains ciliated epithelium and mucus-producing cells. The cilia beat synchronously, clearing the entrapped organisms through the nasopharynx via expulsion or swallowing. In the oropharynx, salivary flow, sloughing of epithelial cells, local production of complement and immunoglobulin A (IgA), and bacterial interference from the resident flora serve as important factors in local host defense.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An intact epiglottic reflex helps to prevent aspiration of infected secretions, and the cough reflex helps to expel materials that may be aspirated. The sharp angles at which the central airways branch cause 5 to 10 micron particles to impact on mucosal surfaces, where they are entrapped in endobronchial mucus. Once entrapped, the ciliary system moves the particles upward out of the airways into the throat, where they are normally swallowed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Humoral immunity &ndash; Secretory IgA is the major immunoglobulin produced in the upper airways and accounts for 10 percent of the total protein concentration of nasal secretions. Although it is not a very good opsonizing agent, it does possess antibacterial and antiviral activity. IgG and IgM enter the airways and alveolar spaces predominantly via transudation from the blood and act to opsonize bacteria, activate complement, and neutralize toxin. Immunoglobulins, surfactant, fibronectin, and complement act as effective opsonins to help eliminate microorganisms (0.5 to 1 micron particles) that reach the terminal airways and alveoli. Free fatty acids, lysozyme, and iron-binding proteins also are present and may be microbicidal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phagocytic cells &ndash; There are two populations of phagocytic cells in the lung: polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) from the blood and macrophages. There are several distinct populations of macrophages, which vary in their location and function:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The alveolar macrophage is located in the alveolar fluid and is the first phagocyte encountered by inert particles and potential pathogens entering the lung. If this cell is overwhelmed, it has the capacity to become a mediator of inflammation and produce cytokines that recruit neutrophils.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Interstitial macrophages are located in the lung connective tissue and serve both as phagocytic cells and antigen-processing cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The intravascular macrophage is located in capillary endothelial cells and phagocytizes and removes foreign material entering the lungs via the bloodstream.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cell-mediated immunity &ndash; Cell-mediated immunity is especially important against certain pathogens, including viruses and intracellular microorganisms that can survive within pulmonary macrophages. Although relatively few in number (5 to 10 percent of the total lung parenchyma cell population), lymphocytes play three critical roles: the production of antibody, cytotoxic activity, and the production of cytokines.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Patterns of pneumonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are five patterns of bacterial pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumonia-in-children-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-etiology/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lobar pneumonia &ndash; Involvement of a single lobe or segment of a lobe.

Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or email these topics to your patients.

Risk factors for pneumonia include environmental crowding, having school-aged siblings, and underlying cardiopulmonary and other medical disorders. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Pneumonia can be caused by a large number of microorganisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54228%7EPEDS%2F71263\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54228 graphicRef71263 \">table 1A-B</a>). The agents commonly responsible vary according to the age of the child and the setting in which the infection is acquired. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Etiologic agents'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children younger than five years, viruses are most common. However, bacterial pathogens, including <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, and <em>S. pyogenes</em>, also are important. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'In children &lt;5 years'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In otherwise healthy children older than five years, <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, <em>M. pneumoniae</em>, and <em>Chlamydia</em> <em>pneumoniae</em> are most common. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'In children &ge;5 years'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Community-associated methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (CA-MRSA) is an increasingly important pathogen in children of all ages, particularly in those with necrotizing pneumonia. <em>S. pneumoniae</em> is another frequent cause of necrotizing pneumonia. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspiration pneumonia is usually caused by anaerobic oral flora. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Aspiration pneumonia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Health care-associated pneumonia is usually caused by gram-negative bacilli or <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.
