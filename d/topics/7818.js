Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 1 diabetes, the mechanism by which hyperglycemia might cause these complications, and an overview of the treatment of diabetes are discussed separately.

This has been shown in several observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In addition, improving glycemic control improves microvascular outcomes, as illustrated by the findings of a meta-analysis of randomized trials (34,912 participants) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There was a reduction in the risk of microvascular complications (a composite outcome including progression of nephropathy, manifestation and progression of retinopathy, and retinal photocoagulation) in the intensive compared with standard glycemic control group (relative risk [RR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.82-0.95). There were significant reductions in risk for each of the individual components.</p><p>In other meta-analyses of trials (over 28,000 adults) evaluating the benefits of intensive versus conventional glycemic control specifically on renal outcomes, there was a statistically significant reduction in the risk of microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria in patients randomly assigned to intensive glycemic control (risk ratios of 0.86 and 0.74, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The reduction in risk of end-stage renal disease did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.46-1.05). There was no reduction in the risk of doubling of the serum creatinine level or death from renal disease (RRs 1.06 and 0.99, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Of note, the majority of the trials in the meta-analyses were not of long enough duration to show a beneficial effect of glycemic control on end-stage renal disease, which typically manifests after 10 to 20 years of diabetes duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In the trials included in the meta-analyses, the absolute rates of severe renal outcomes were low in both the intensive- and conventional-therapy groups, reducing the ability of the analysis to demonstrate a benefit, if one exists. In the one trial with longer-term follow-up (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study [UKPDS] cohort followed for 22 years), there was a beneficial effect of intensive therapy on the development of more advanced clinical outcomes, including renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In the DCCT, for example, the incidence of new retinopathy was 12 percent with intensive therapy versus 54 percent with conventional therapy. One possible explanation for this difference is that the difference in A1C values was smaller between the intensive and conventional therapy groups in the UKPDS (7.0 versus 7.9 percent) compared with the DCCT (7.2 versus 9.1 percent).</p><p>A subset of 753 overweight patients (mean body mass index [BMI] 31 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> was included in a separate treatment arm in which intensive blood glucose control with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> was compared with conventional therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The comparison of metformin and dietary policy (control) in the overweight group showed a similar magnitude reduction in microvascular outcomes (specifically retinal outcomes or renal disease) as in the sulfonylurea and insulin-treated groups, but it did not achieve a statistical significance, perhaps due to poor power.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Post-trial monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following completion of the UKPDS in 1997, all surviving patients (n = 3277) entered a post-trial monitoring program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Subjects received care from community- or hospital-based clinicians with no attempt to maintain previously randomized therapy but with a universal goal of achieving lower levels of glucose and blood pressure. They were evaluated by annual UKPDS clinic visits for five years and by questionnaire in years 6 through 10.</p><p>Although mean A1C level (7.9 and 8.5 percent, respectively) was better in the intensive versus conventional therapy group at the beginning of the post-trial monitoring period, baseline differences were lost by one year. After five years of post-trial observation, there were no significant differences in A1C (approximately 7.8 percent), body weight, lipid levels, or blood pressure in patients previously assigned to intensive or conventional groups.</p><p>Reductions in the relative risk of diabetes-related endpoints and microvascular disease that had been noted in the intensively treated patients (sulfonylurea-insulin) during the intervention trial were maintained in the postinterventional period despite similar glycemic control. During the entire follow-up period (a median of 17 years), the risk of microvascular complications in the group formerly assigned to intensive treatment with sulfonylurea-insulin remained lower than those formerly assigned to conventional treatment (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64-0.89).</p><p>The long-term follow-up of the overweight subcohort assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> or dietary intervention during the active trial continued to show no statistically significant difference in microvascular outcomes, again perhaps related to limited power [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Kumamoto study</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a trial of 110 patients with type 2 diabetes from Japan, intensive therapy was also beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

After a median follow-up of 3.7 years, intensive therapy was stopped due to a higher number of total and cardiovascular deaths in subjects assigned to intensive therapy (median A1C 6.4 percent) compared with the standard-treatment group (median A1C 7.5 percent). Patients in the intensive-therapy arm were transitioned to standard therapy, and all patients were followed for microvascular outcomes, predefined secondary endpoints, until completion of the study (five years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The median A1C in the intensive group remained lower than in the standard-therapy group (7.2 versus 7.6 percent at study end). There were two composite microvascular outcomes. The first was dialysis or renal transplantation, high serum creatinine (&gt;3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [291.72 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]),</span> or retinal photocoagulation or vitrectomy to treat diabetic retinopathy (designed to be similar to the UKPDS microvascular aggregate outcome), and the second was peripheral neuropathy plus the first composite outcome. The difference in the number of patients experiencing either composite outcome at study transition or at study end was not significant (HR 0.95 for both composite outcomes at study end with 95% CIs 0.85-1.07 and 0.89-1.01 for the first and second outcomes, respectively). There was a significant decrease in the incidence of microvascular renal outcomes in the intensive-therapy group at study transition and study end (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77-0.94 for microalbuminuria at study end).</p><p>In a substudy of the ACCORD trial, the ACCORD Eye study, 2856 participants were evaluated for the effects of intensive (median A1C 6.4 percent) or standard (median A1C 7.5 percent) glycemia therapy on the progression of diabetic retinopathy measured by fundus photography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Progression of diabetic retinopathy was defined by three or more steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) Severity Scale or the development of proliferative retinopathy requiring photocoagulation or vitrectomy. At four years, there was a reduction in the proportion of patients with progression of retinopathy in the intensive-therapy group (7.3 versus 10.4 percent, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.51-0.87).

In the UKPDS, there was no evidence of a threshold effect for A1C; a 1 percent fall in A1C was associated with a 35 percent reduction in microvascular endpoints. In addition, the results of the post-trial monitoring phase of the UKPDS show that a sustained period of glycemic control in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes has lasting benefit in reducing microvascular disease.</p><p>The lack of benefit of intensive control in VADT may be secondary to the duration of diabetes in subjects participating in VADT (mean 11.5 years versus newly diagnosed in UKPDS) and the time required to show benefit (delayed benefit may require longer follow-up). In addition, aggressive treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia in all VADT participants may have contributed to the inability to show a microvascular benefit of intensive glucose control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MACROVASCULAR DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologic analyses (observational studies or secondary analyses of trials) suggest a correlation between higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic hyperglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-24</a>].

None show a benefit of intensive control, and results from ACCORD showed a significant increase in total (hazard ratio [HR] 1.22) and CVD (HR 1.35) mortality with intensive therapy.</p><p>In contrast to these trials, the UKPDS was designed to investigate the role of glycemic control on the complications of diabetes in newly diagnosed patients.

The A1C goal should be set somewhat higher (eg, &lt;8 percent) for older patients and those with a limited life expectancy. The American Geriatrics Society suggests an A1C target of 8 percent for frail older adults and individuals with life expectancy of less than five years.

The results of the ACCORD trial suggest that a target A1C of 7.0 to 7.9 percent (achieving a median of 7.5 percent) may be safer for patients with longstanding type 2 diabetes who are at high risk for CVD than a target A1C of 6.0 percent (achieving a median of 6.4 percent). This target is supported by the results of a retrospective cohort study of approximately 48,000 patients with type 2 diabetes, aged 50 years and older, whose treatment had been intensified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

However, these costs were largely offset by a reduction in the cost of complications and an increased time free of complications, similar to Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) results in type 1 diabetes.</p><p>A group of investigators developed a Markov type model with Monte Carlo simulation techniques to simulate the natural history of type 2 diabetes using assumptions based upon the best available published epidemiologic, natural history, and intervention studies (prior to publication of results from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes [ACCORD] and Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation [ADVANCE] trials) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. They used this model to estimate the cost effectiveness of treating type 2 diabetes intensively with the goal of normoglycemia and concluded that the incremental cost would be approximately USD $16,000 per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, this favorable estimate was based upon several important assumptions, particularly suboptimal treatment in the standard-care group. The cost per QALY would be considerably higher if the standard of care for conventional treatment were improved (eg, avoidance of smoking, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors, careful foot care) or if the intensive therapy were less successful or were applied to patients over age 55 years.</p><p>A second analysis using a Markov decision model found that interventions that reduce A1C values by 2 percent would be most cost effective if applied to patients who are younger or have higher A1C values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. As an example, if patients with an A1C value of 12 percent were targeted for the intervention to reduce their A1C value to 10 percent and keep it at that level for life, the number needed to treat to prevent one case of blindness would be 25. By comparison, if this intervention were applied to those whose A1C values were 9 percent (and would be reduced to 7 percent), the number needed to treat would be 181.</p><p>The authors of this study suggested that 84 percent of the potential benefit from such an intervention could be accomplished by targeting only 17 percent of patients with type 2 diabetes, using the following entry criteria: A1C value above 9 percent for patients who develop diabetes in their 40s, above 10 percent for patients who develop diabetes in their 50s, above 11 percent for those who develop diabetes in their 60s, and above 12 percent for those who develop diabetes in their 70s.

Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

In contrast, the results of the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) post-trial, observational follow-up study suggest that initial intensive control (glycated hemoglobin [A1C] 7.0 percent) in individuals with newly diagnosed diabetes has long-term benefit in decreasing the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), diabetes-related death, and overall death. In the aggregate, the clinical evidence supports initiating intensive therapy with the goal of lowering A1C levels to &lt;7.0 percent as early as possible in the course of diabetes. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Macrovascular disease'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Target A1C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) goals in patients with type 2 diabetes should be tailored to the individual, balancing the improvement in microvascular complications with the risk of hypoglycemia. A reasonable goal of therapy might be an A1C value of &le;7.0 percent for most patients (using an assay in which the upper limit of normal is 6.0 percent). Glycemic targets are generally set somewhat higher (eg, &lt;8 percent) for older patients and those with comorbidities or a limited life expectancy and little likelihood of benefit from intensive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Glycemic targets'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Multifactorial risk reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vigorous cardiac risk reduction (smoking cessation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, blood pressure control, reduction in serum lipids, preferably using a statin, diet, exercise, and, in high-risk patients, an angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor) should be a top priority for all patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>In spite of evidence that aggressive risk factor reduction lowers the risk of both micro- and macrovascular complications in patients with diabetes, the vast majority of patients do not achieve recommended goals for A1C, blood pressure control, and management of dyslipidemia.
