This can be achieved by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), usually with stenting, or fibrinolytic therapy. Primary PCI is preferred if it can be performed (door-to-balloon time) within 90 to 120 minutes of presentation to the hospital because of greater efficacy in achieving coronary perfusion and better clinical outcomes.

In addition, the secondary end point of major adverse cardiac events at six months was equivalent in the two groups (10 versus 11 percent). The lack of benefit persisted when only the 83 percent of patients undergoing primary PCI (not rescue) were evaluated and was seen in all subsets.</p><p>A lack of benefit was also noted in two later randomized trials, PROMISE and DEDICATION, which were of similar design but used a different distal embolic protection device (FilterWire) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suboptimal-reperfusion-after-primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].

It is notable in this regard that the device is effective in saphenous vein grafts where there are no branches. It is possible that distal protection using filter devices may overcome some of these limitations.

This was suggested in a report that retrospectively evaluated 110 consecutive patients with an acute MI who underwent primary PCI without distal protection and 81 consecutive subsequent patients who were treated with distal protection; all patients also underwent angioscopy and ruptured plaque was seen in 106 of the 191 patients (55 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/suboptimal-reperfusion-after-primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].
