Most patients with AAA are asymptomatic but come to medical attention by findings of a pulsatile mass on physical examination, as the result of other abdominal imaging studies, or through ultrasound screening programs for AAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. When symptoms do occur, patients commonly present with abdominal, back, or flank pain, but thromboembolism can also occur, leading to symptoms of limb ischemia. Aneurysms that produce symptoms are at an increased risk for rupture, which is associated with high mortality rates. </p><p>A diagnosis of AAA generally requires imaging confirmation that an aneurysm is present, which is most often accomplished using abdominal ultrasound. However, in symptomatic patients, computed tomography of the abdomen provides additional information that can determine if the aneurysm has ruptured, is expanding rapidly, and, for those without signs of rupture, whether or not symptoms are likely to be related to the aneurysm or due to other abdominal pathology.</p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of AAA will be reviewed here. The management of nonruptured and ruptured AAA is discussed elsewhere.

Although &quot;normal&quot; diameter varies with age, gender, and body habitus, the average diameter of the human infrarenal aorta is approximately 2.0 cm; the upper limit of normal is typically &lt;3.0 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

In some, but not all, countries, screening programs for AAA appear to have contributed to a reduced incidence of ruptured AAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/1,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16,17</a>]. Screening for AAA is discussed elsewhere.

The ability to palpate and estimate the aortic diameter depends upon the patient's body habitus, the size of the aneurysm, and the clinical experience of the practitioner. (See <a href=\"#H181174645\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal palpation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incidental finding on radiography &ndash; AAA is frequently detected as an incidental finding on imaging studies performed for other purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. It is important to note that this information is often <strong>not</strong> passed on to the referring physician, and up to one-third of patients with aneurysms detected incidentally underwent no subsequent monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/19,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,23-25</a>]. The following findings are illustrative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One review study identified AAA in 1 percent of 79,121 abdominal imaging studies, including computed tomography of the abdomen, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The mean aortic diameter was 4.0 cm.

Iliac aneurysm commonly occurs in association with AAA. In a retrospective review of 10,038 patients with iliac aneurysm, 89 percent had a coexistent AAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Another study found a 14 percent incidence of femoral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> popliteal artery aneurysms in association with AAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=popliteal-artery-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Popliteal artery aneurysm&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iliac-artery-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iliac artery aneurysm&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15830889\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic (nonruptured) AAA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic AAA refers to any of a number of symptoms that can be attributed to the aneurysm. In surgical series, between 5 and 22 percent of AAA are symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/28-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-33</a>]. Because symptoms in association with a diagnosis of AAA increase the risk for rupture, symptoms that are not obviously attributable to another cause (eg, diverticulitis) should be presumed to be due to the aneurysm, until proven otherwise. (See <a href=\"#H181175753\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H1191820574\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Aneurysm repair versus conservative management'</a>.)</p><p>AAA can also present initially as a complication of instrumentation of the aorta (eg, arteriography, cardiac catheterization). As catheters are passed through the aorta, thrombus or atherosclerotic debris associated with the aneurysm can dislodge and embolize distally. Thromboembolism from thrombus within AAA has also been reported following abdominal trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H181175588\" class=\"local\">'Limb ischemia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15830929\"><span class=\"h2\">Ruptured AAA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aortic rupture is due to the weakening of the aortic wall to the extent that it can no longer support the forces imposed upon it, leading to a full-thickness loss of tissue integrity that results in escape of blood outside the confines of the aorta, typically into the retroperitoneum, but occasionally free into the abdominal cavity. The AAA can also rupture into the adjacent vena cava, causing aortocaval fistula. (See <a href=\"#H181174722\" class=\"local\">'Other manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>Whether aortic rupture is due to AAA or to another disease process (eg, penetrating aortic ulcer, aortic dissection) can only be ascertained though aortic imaging. (See <a href=\"#H22322988\" class=\"local\">'Imaging symptomatic patients'</a> below.)</p><p>The incidence of ruptured AAA in hospitalized patients underestimates the overall incidence of ruptured AAA because only approximately one-half of patients with ruptured AAA survive long enough for treatment, and not all patients with sudden death undergo autopsy to confirm the cause of death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-risk-factors-pathogenesis-and-natural-history-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, and natural history of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;</a>.)</p><p>AAA can present initially with rupture with no intervening symptoms. Although the signs and symptoms of ruptured AAA (rAAA) may be obvious (eg, patient with known AAA in shock), some presentations make ruptured AAA difficult to recognize.&nbsp;Patients with rupture into the retroperitoneum may attribute their symptoms to other causes and delay seeking medical attention. Even after presenting to a physician, a misdiagnosis of rAAA as ureteral colic, myocardial infarction, perforated viscus, diverticulitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, or ischemic bowel occurs approximately 30 percent of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. A systematic review noted that, although advanced cross-sectional imaging has become more widely available, the rate of initial misdiagnosis for patients with rAAA decreased only slightly from 42 percent for studies performed before 1990 to 32 percent for those performed later (four studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>An unsuspected AAA rupture can also be diagnosed on imaging studies obtained to evaluate symptoms presumed to be due to another diagnosis, or a diagnosis of ruptured AAA may only be learned upon autopsy after the patient's demise. </p><p>The clinical presentation of ruptured AAA in patients who have undergone prior endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is similar to that of de novo rupture. Post-EVAR rupture is due to unresolved endoleak repressurizing the aneurysm sac and is most commonly seen in patients who have undergone EVAR with less than ideal anatomy or in those who have not been compliant with post-EVAR follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1382371318\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition to assessing risk factors, the patient and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> guardian should be asked:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether a diagnosis of AAA has been established in the past. Values of aortic diameter from prior imaging studies should be obtained for comparison. Whenever serial imaging studies are available, prior rates of aortic expansion <span class=\"nowrap\">(cm/year)</span> should be obtained (or calculated) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87327\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87327 \">image 5</a>). This can be accomplished by taking the maximal aortic diameter from one year and subtracting the diameter from the prior year and dividing by the number of intervening years. As an example, if the aneurysm measured 3.5 cm one year and 5.25 cm two years later, the expansion rate is (5.25 cm - 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm)/2</span> years or 0.875 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year,</span> which exceeds the average expansion rate of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year</span> and may increase the risk for rupture.

Following open AAA repair, late anastomotic failures can occur at the proximal or distal anastomosis with or without associated graft infection, leading to pseudoaneurysm.

AAA can also present with limb ischemia, or with systemic manifestations related to an infected aneurysm or inflammatory aneurysm.

In association with <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/back/flank</span> pain, distal embolism can be a sign of aneurysm rupture. Rarely, AAA can also present with acute aortic thrombosis leading to bilateral lower extremity ischemia, or rarely, spinal cord ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. </p><p>During AAA formation, thrombus builds up gradually along the wall as the aorta expands over time. This thrombus is typically laminated, well formed, and adherent to the wall of the aorta but may become disrupted as a result of more abrupt changes in aortic wall configuration (ie, rapid expansion), instrumentation, or trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/34,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,51</a>]. In some patients, aortic debris may be more friable and more prone to embolization. During AAA rupture, new thrombus may form in the region of the aortic tear, which can also embolize; however, distal embolization associated with AAA rupture may more often be related to aortic manipulation during open repair or instrumentation during endovascular repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

In the available studies, up to one-third of the clinical manifestations associated with symptomatic AAA may be related to embolism, but the incidence varies widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. This variability is likely due to the fact that AAA as the source for lower extremity ischemia is inferred from imaging studies that are typically obtained to evaluate progression of chronic lower extremity symptoms (eg, claudication, ischemic pain). In one retrospective review of 302 patients who underwent repair of AAA, 15 patients presented with distal embolization as the first manifestation of their AAA, which was limb-threatening in three patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In this study, the risk of embolization did not correlate with aneurysm diameter; 13 of 15 of the aneurysms that presented with embolization were &lt;5.0 cm. </p><p>Thromboemboli from AAA can be single or multiple. The clinical manifestations of distal thromboembolism depend upon the size of the debris and number of embolic events. Clinical manifestations may not be apparent if smaller vessels are affected and arterial occlusion is well compensated, or the patients may present with chronic symptoms (eg, claudication). Alternatively, embolism may present acutely with painful, blue digits (blue toe syndrome) or with a painful, pulseless, cool extremity.

When AAA initially presents in this manner, the diagnosis is frequently confounded and delayed. Patients with the inflammatory variant are younger and more often symptomatic than patients with noninflammatory AAA. Patients with inflammatory AAA also have abnormalities of serum inflammatory markers, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

However, in patients with ruptured AAA, a pulsatile abdominal mass is present in up to 62 percent of patients and is an important sign for making a correct initial diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Most patients with ruptured AAA also have some degree of abdominal distention and tenderness. </p><p>An abdominal examination focused specifically on the diagnosis of AAA is more likely to identify an aneurysm than a nonfocused examination. AAA most often occurs in the segment of aorta below the renal arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60682\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60682 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, with the patient supine on the examination table and garments removed from the abdomen, palpation of the abdominal aorta is performed by gently but deeply palpating the abdomen between the xiphoid and umbilicus to identify a widened pulse that suggests the presence of an aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Many patients will experience mild tenderness with deep palpation of the aneurysm. Patients with inflammatory or infected aneurysms may exhibit a greater degree of tenderness to palpation. This finding should not be used to brand the aneurysm as symptomatic in order to justify treatment. It is important to note that palpation of the abdomen to detect AAA is <strong>safe</strong> and has never been reported to precipitate aortic rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. </p><p>Detection of an AAA by abdominal palpation is more likely when the aneurysm is large and when abdominal girth is small (waist &lt;40 inches).

Sensitivity significantly improved with increasing aneurysm diameter (61 percent, 3.0 to 3.9 cm; 69 percent, 4.0 to 4.9 cm; 72 percent, 4.0 cm or larger; 82 percent &gt;5.0 cm). The patient's abdominal circumference also affected the examination with an overall sensitivity of 91 percent for patients with a waistline &lt;40 inches (100 cm) versus 53 percent for &gt;40 inches (100 cm). For a waistline of &lt;40 inches, abdominal palpation was 100 percent sensitive for detecting AAA &ge;5.0 cm.</p><p/><p>A prominent but normal-sized aorta or a nonvascular mass overlying an easily transmitted, palpable aortic pulse can be mistaken as AAA, particularly in thin patients. Patients with hypertension, a wide pulse pressure, or a tortuous aorta can also have prominent aortic pulsation that may be mistaken for an AAA. For these reasons, it is important to obtain an imaging study to confirm AAA diagnosed on the basis of abdominal palpation.

With routine use of the Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) exam, many emergency department physicians are comfortable with the abdominal ultrasound exam and can quickly identify an abnormally enlarged aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. If the aneurysm is ruptured, retroperitoneal hematoma may also be seen, but the rupture site is not usually identified. When AAA is identified on ultrasound in a patient with hypotension and <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/flank/back</span> pain, a presumptive diagnosis of ruptured AAA can be made. </p><p>For symptomatic patients suspected of having AAA who are hemodynamically stable, we recommend urgent abdominal CT, typically using intravenous contrast, rather than ultrasound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86821\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef86821 \">algorithm 1</a>). If there is a concern for contrast-induced nephropathy, a noncontrast CT scan may be sufficient to provide additional anatomic details. Abdominal CT has the advantage of evaluating the abdomen in more detail, which is necessary for differentiating ruptured from nonruptured aneurysm, and CT is better than ultrasound for evaluating suprarenal aneurysms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87420\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87420 \">image 17</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/90-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">90-93</a>].

Abdominal CT defines the extent of the aneurysm (outer-wall-to-outer-wall measurement perpendicular to the path of the aneurysm), providing important anatomic information by which to plan urgent AAA repair, and determines whether the aneurysm is suited to endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87333\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87333 \">image 18</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/90-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">90-93</a>]. Disadvantages of CT compared with ultrasonography are the potential to overestimate the aortic diameter, greater cost, the requirement for intravenous contrast (when CT arteriography is required), and the cumulative risk of radiation with repeated scans in patients with known AAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. AAA diameter on CT scan should be measured perpendicular to the centerline of the aorta, to avoid overestimation, which can be obtained by using orthogonal measurements or facilitated with semi-automated software [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>].</p><p>Intravenous contrast is generally not needed to establish a diagnosis of ruptured AAA (rAAA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. However, many vascular centers use abdominal CT with intravenous contrast or CT angiography with three-dimensional reconstruction for suspected rAAA in anticipation of potential endovascular repair. However, in the setting of volume depletion, the risk for renal dysfunction is increased.

In addition, the aortic wall should be evaluated to determine whether the aneurysm appears to be infected or is consistent with an inflammatory aneurysm. Lastly, for symptomatic patients in whom AAA is present but clearly not ruptured, a judgment must be made as to whether the aneurysm is the most likely cause for the symptoms in the context of other pathology that may be present on imaging.

(See <a href=\"#H22314616\" class=\"local\">'Are symptoms related to AAA?'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

The abdominal aorta below the renal arteries (infrarenal) is the most common site for aortic aneurysm. In the infrarenal aorta, a maximum diameter &ge;3.0 cm is aneurysmal in the majority of patients. (See <a href=\"#H22314302\" class=\"local\">'Aneurysm definition and anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with AAA do not have any symptoms. Asymptomatic AAA may be discovered as a result of screening in patients with risk factors for AAA, on routine physical examination, or on imaging studies to evaluate an unrelated complaint. (See <a href=\"#H15830649\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient's medical history identifies the risk factors for developing AAA and risk factors associated with rupture. The patient and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> family members should be asked whether a diagnosis of AAA has been established in the past or if a prior AAA repair has been performed. The history may also help determine if clinical manifestations are likely related to a possible AAA versus another medical condition. Symptoms potentially related to AAA (eg, pain) can mimic those of many other diseases; however, in patients known to have or subsequently shown to have AAA, symptoms are presumed to be due to the aneurysm until unequivocally proven otherwise. (See <a href=\"#H1382371370\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22314616\" class=\"local\">'Are symptoms related to AAA?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AAA does not typically cause symptoms unless the aneurysm is expanding rapidly, has become large enough to compress surrounding structures, is an inflammatory or infectious aneurysm, or has ruptured. Patients with symptomatic AAA most commonly present with abdominal, back, or flank pain, which may or may not be associated with AAA rupture. The classic triad of acute abdominal pain, abdominal distention, and hemodynamic instability is present in approximately 50 percent of patients with ruptured AAA. AAA can also present with other clinical manifestations such as limb ischemia (acute or chronic), or other systemic manifestations (fever, malaise). (See <a href=\"#H181175753\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sole use of abdominal palpation cannot be relied upon to diagnose or exclude AAA. Abdominal palpation is approximately 70 percent sensitive overall for the detection of AAA. The sensitivity of palpation increases with increasing AAA diameter and is affected by the abdominal girth of the patient. For patients with an abdominal circumference &lt;40 inches (100 cm), the sensitivity of abdominal palpation approaches 100 percent for the detection of AAA &ge;5.0 cm. (See <a href=\"#H181174645\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal palpation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although AAA may be suspected based upon risk factors, abdominal palpation, or clinical manifestations, a definitive diagnosis requires abdominal imaging studies that demonstrate a focal, aortic dilation meeting the criteria for aneurysm (&gt;1.5 times normal diameter). Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography of the abdomen are both highly sensitive and specific for diagnosing AAA but are recommended under differing clinical circumstances (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F86821\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef86821 \">algorithm 1</a>) depending upon the presence of symptoms and the hemodynamic status of the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most asymptomatic patients, we recommend abdominal ultrasound as the initial diagnostic modality. Ultrasound is noninvasive and cost effective for diagnosing AAA in asymptomatic patients. (See <a href=\"#H22322286\" class=\"local\">'Imaging asymptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most symptomatic patients who are hemodynamically stable, we recommend computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen as the initial diagnostic modality. Abdominal CT provides additional anatomic detail that identifies ruptured aneurysm, infected aneurysm, inflammatory aneurysm, and other features that are important in the subsequent management of symptomatic AAA. Abdominal CT may also identify other pathologies that may be the source of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H22322988\" class=\"local\">'Imaging symptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For hemodynamically unstable patients suspected of having ruptured AAA, where a diagnosis of AAA is NOT previously known, we suggest a focused ultrasonography exam (bedside, operating room) to confirm that an aneurysm exists prior to exploration, provided it is immediately available. Patients with a known AAA, who present with classic symptoms and signs of rupture, are generally taken for repair without preoperative imaging. (See <a href=\"#H22322988\" class=\"local\">'Imaging symptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2494373209\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We are saddened by the death of Emile R Mohler, III, MD, who passed away in October 2017.
