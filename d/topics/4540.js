Acquired copper deficiency has only recently been recognized to cause a myelopathy in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]; however cases of myelopathy described among zinc-smelter workers in the 19<sup>th</sup> century are now felt likely to be due to copper deficiency myelopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The neurologic manifestations of copper deficiency are usually, but not always, accompanied by the typical hematologic derangements of anemia and leukopenia. </p><p>This topic discusses the neurologic manifestations of acquired copper deficiency.

Copper is a component of enzymes that have a critical role in the structure and function of the nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/6-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-12</a>]. It permits electron transfer in key enzymatic pathways. These include cytochrome-c-oxidase for electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation, <span class=\"nowrap\">copper/zinc</span> superoxide dismutase for antioxidant defense, tyrosinase for melanin synthesis, dopamine beta-hydroxylase for catecholamine biosynthesis, lysyl oxidase for crosslinking of collagen and elastin, peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase for neuropeptide and peptide hormone processing, monoamine oxidase for serotonin synthesis, and ceruloplasmin for brain iron homeostasis.</p><p>There are limited pathologic studies in individuals with acquired copper deficiency. A few reports of nerve biopsies in patients confirm the presence of axonal degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/1,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13-16</a>]. A single postmortem examination in one patient revealed significant degeneration in the dorsal and lateral columns of the spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In animals, neuronal loss in the cerebellum and spinal tracts with extensive demyelination is reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37833569\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF ACQUIRED COPPER DEFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although rare, acquired copper deficiency has been well documented in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/6,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,18</a>].

Typically neurologic manifestations are delayed by years following gastric surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-surgery-postoperative-nutritional-management#H22238680\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric surgery: Postoperative nutritional management&quot;, section on 'Copper'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive zinc ingestion is another cause of copper deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/3,30,31,34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,30,31,34-38</a>]. Copper and zinc are competitively absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In addition to overuse of zinc supplements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], ingestion of denture cream [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/17,35-37,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,35-37,40</a>] and parenteral zinc overloading during chronic hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] have also been linked to copper deficiency myelopathy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary copper deficiency is rare, but has been described in premature infants receiving milk formulas without adequate copper supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/6,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,42</a>]. Copper deficiency may also be a complication of prolonged <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>, in particular when copper supplementation is withheld due to cholestasis or other reason [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/8,31,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,31,43</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enteropathies associated with malabsorption, such as cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel disease may be associated with copper deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/1,6,18,31,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,18,31,44,45</a>].

Bacterial overgrowth has also been implicated as a cause of copper deficiency in a patient with a prior history of gastric surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over-treatment of Wilson disease with zinc and chelators has only rarely been reported to cause copper deficiency-related neurologic manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/48-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-52</a>]. Other copper-chelators, tetrathiomolybdate, have been associated with copper deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The antiparasitic agent, clioquinol, is a copper chelator and was linked to many cases of myelo-optico-neuropathy (a syndrome similar to copper deficiency myeloneuropathy) in Japan in the 1960s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. </p><p/><p>The co-existence of multiple causes of copper deficiency increases the risk of a clinically significant deficiency state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In some cases, the cause of copper deficiency is not evident even after extensive investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/1,4,5,15,28,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5,15,28,58</a>]. </p><p>These and other risk factors for copper deficiency are discussed in more detail separately.

Patients typically present with a subacute gait disorder with prominent sensory ataxia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spasticity. Examination reveals long tract signs with spasticity in the legs and Babinski response, along with impaired vibration and position sense and a positive Romberg sign. Bladder dysfunction is relatively uncommon, but can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/2,5,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,29</a>]. This pattern of neurologic deficits reflects involvement of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord and is similar to that seen in patients with subacute combined degeneration secondary to vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;, section on 'Dorsal (posterior) cord syndrome'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders affecting the spinal cord&quot;, section on 'Subacute combined degeneration'</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms and signs suggesting an associated peripheral neuropathy are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The neuropathy may take different forms. A complaint of lower limb paresthesias is present in nearly all patients, and most demonstrate a stocking distribution of impaired sensation to pain and temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/1,2,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,20</a>]. Superimposed neuropathy may lead to suppressed reflexes in the legs, although many patients have brisk reflexes instead, reflecting the myelopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A common finding is brisk knee jerks with depressed or absent ankle jerks. Less common peripheral nerve manifestations include a wrist or foot drop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], asymmetric sensory symptoms of the face and trunk as well as limbs, suggesting a sensory ganglionopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and a progressive, asymmetric weakness with electrodiagnostic evidence of denervation suggesting lower motor neuron disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/14,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,36</a>]. In most cases, the associated neuropathy develops along with the myelopathy; however, in some cases, these develop before the myelopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] or in the absence of a myelopathic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/27,28,35,48,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28,35,48,60</a>]. Not all of the cases of reported isolated neuropathy in this setting were confirmed by careful neurologic examination; the association between copper deficiency and an isolated neuropathy requires further study. &#160;</p><p>Optic nerve involvement of varying severity has been reported as part of this syndrome in a number of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/23,27,29,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,27,29,61</a>], although not in most. Affected patients typically have subacute-onset of bilateral vision loss, without optic disc edema.</p><p>Rare neurologic symptoms associated with copper deficiency in isolated case reports include myopathy (along with myelopathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], myelo-optico-neuropathy with hyposmia and hypogeusia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

The anemia may be microcytic, macrocytic, or normocytic. Thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia are relatively rare. Typical bone marrow findings include a left shift in granulocytic and erythroid maturation with cytoplasmic vacuolization in erythroid and myeloid precursors and the presence of ringed sideroblasts or hemosiderin containing plasma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/28,31,35,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,31,35,65</a>]. Erythroid hyperplasia with decreased myeloid to erythroid ratio and dyserythropoiesis including megaloblastic changes may be seen. In some cases, patients with copper deficiency were initially given a diagnosis of sideroblastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or aplastic anemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H61087758\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One case series and a case report describe hepatic iron overload <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cirrhosis in five patients with copper deficiency myeloneuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/30,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,66</a>].

Measurement of 24-hour urinary copper excretion is a less sensitive marker for copper deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/31,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,72</a>].</p><p>All described cases of copper deficiency myeloneuropathy have had low serum copper levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/2,4,16,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,16,59</a>]. However, in marginal copper deficiency, serum copper levels may be normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/8,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,73</a>]. Ceruloplasmin is an acute phase reactant and will be elevated in the presence of inflammatory conditions and also at times in pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, liver disease, malignancy, hematologic disease, myocardial infarction, infections, smoking, diabetes, and uremia. It is possible that in these settings, levels of serum copper and ceruloplasmin may be normal, even while stores of copper are low, and a copper deficiency could be masked. Copper levels may also be low in the absence of true copper deficiency in patients with Wilson&rsquo;s disease or in heterozygous carriers of the Wilson disease gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

A significant elevation in these should prompt an investigation for an exogenous source of zinc. However, zinc levels have been reported to be modestly elevated in some patients with copper deficiency myeloneuropathy in the absence of known excessive zinc ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels should be checked as vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency may co-exist with copper deficiency, particularly in cases of prior gastric surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

When performed, a slight, nonspecific elevation in the CSF protein may be seen in this disorder, but no other abnormalities are generally reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/1,15,23,36,37,39,41,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15,23,36,37,39,41,48</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37837827\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been no studies that address the most appropriate dose, duration, route, and form of copper supplementation, and many regimens have been used successfully. Commonly used copper salts include copper gluconate, copper sulphate, and copper chloride. For oral replacement, we typically use elemental copper. </p><p>Because of the need for long term replacement, parenteral therapy is not preferred and is not required in most patients. Some clinicians have employed initial parenteral administration followed by oral administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Copper supplements may not be adequately absorbed when administered through a jejunostomy tube necessitating parenteral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Other situations in which parenteral therapy may be preferred or required include severely depleted patients or significant malabsorption. </p><p>The standard dose is 2 mg of elemental copper per day. The same dose of elemental copper may be given intravenously; a commonly used regimen is 2 mg of elemental copper administered intravenously (over two hours) daily for five days and periodically thereafter. Subcutaneous and intramuscular supplementation have also been employed. Some patients require higher doses. In our practice, we give 8 mg of elemental copper each day orally for a week, 6 mg for the second week, 4 mg for the third week, and 2 mg thereafter. Periodic assessment of serum copper is essential to determine adequacy of replacement and to decide on the most appropriate long term administration strategy. </p><p>In those patients in whom excess zinc ingestion is the likely cause, stopping zinc supplementation may suffice and no additional copper supplementation may be required. However, copper supplementation is generally started at least initially in addition to stopping zinc supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Copper deficiency in gastrointestinal disease may be accompanied by deficiencies of zinc, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, vitamin D, vitamin E, and iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]; these should be supplemented as well when appropriate. However, iron therapy in a patient with anemia of indeterminate cause may decrease copper absorption.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37838016\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Copper supplementation generally prevents further neurologic deterioration, but improvement of neurologic signs and symptoms is variable, often subjective, and limited to sensory symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/1,2,4,5,23,24,26,33-35,37,39,44,59,63,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4,5,23,24,26,33-35,37,39,44,59,63,78</a>].

The duration and severity of symptoms prior to supplementation may influence prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. </p><p>In contrast, response of the hematological parameters (including bone marrow findings) is prompt and often complete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/copper-deficiency-myeloneuropathy/abstract/1,2,5,16,28,35,37,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5,16,28,35,37,62</a>].
