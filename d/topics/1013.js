The antigen recognized by these antibodies, originally called a ribonuclease-sensitive extractable nuclear antigen (RNAse sensitive ENA), is known to be a U1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. The presence of antibodies to U1 RNP remains a sine qua non for the diagnosis of this disorder; indeed, their emergence often precedes the onset of clinical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The immunobiology of anti-U1 RNP antibodies in mixed connective tissue disease will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of this disorder, as well as a general discussion of anti-RNP autoantibodies, are discussed separately.

Because the cytosol and nucleoplasm need to be densely packed with a severe restriction on diffusion of macromolecules, partitioning of the eukaryote cell into functionally specialized compartments is essential for efficiency. This necessitates the association of RNA and protein into large ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, including nucleosomes and spliceosomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There is compelling evidence that autoimmunity is often antigen-driven by these RNA-associated components of subcellular particles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The U1-RNA component of U1 RNP is capable of activating toll-like receptors (TLRs); this early innate immune response may be a critical event in the initiation of autoimmunity to RNA protein complexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The innate immune response is often a mechanism whereby antigens are &quot;focused&quot; as a prelude to the T-cell recognition that is characteristic of adaptive immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. TLRs include molecules that recognize single-stranded DNA (TLR3) and double-stranded RNA (TLR7, TLR8). This may be of some relevance to U1 RNP autoimmunity, as U1-RNA 70 kD reactive T-cell clones preferentially recognize a residue within the RNA binding portion of the 70 kD peptide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and U1 RNA can induce an innate immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoimmunity to nucleosomal components</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nucleosomes are the compact building blocks of chromatin and consist of an octamer of two copies of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, wrapped around approximately 146 base pairs of DNA. During apoptosis, endonucleases cleave chromatin with the liberation of nucleosomal particles. Following the release into the cytoplasm, nucleosomes migrate to the surface of the dying cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and thus become accessible to B-cell receptors. Nucleosomal antibodies are directed to antigenic determinants on the intact nucleosome rather than its individual components, DNA, and histones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a study of 496 patients with 13 different connective tissue diseases and of 100 patients with hepatitis C, antinucleosome antibodies were found only in the sera of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis, and mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) (72, 46, and 45 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoimmunity to spliceosomal components</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autoimmunity to specific components of the spliceosome is the immunological signature of MCTD. Spliceosomes are complex nuclear particles that are involved in the processing of pre-messenger RNA into mature &quot;spliced RNA.&quot; The 26S proteasome is a large subcellular particle involved in the degradation of proteins that have been tagged with ubiquitin and the generation peptides for presentation by the major histocompatability complex (MHC) class I molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Certain components of the spliceosome are common targets of autoimmunity in the diffuse connective tissue diseases (DCTDs). Furthermore, it appears that post-translational modifications of these molecules, as occur during apoptosis, are often associated with increased immunogenicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. There are two major spliceosomal sub-units that are antigenic targets in autoimmunity: 1) small nuclear ribonucleoprotein protein particles (snRNPs); and 2) heterogeneous nuclear RNP particles (hnRNPs).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Small nuclear RNP particles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The snRNPs contain small RNA species ranging in size from 80 to 350 nucleotides that are complexed with proteins. These RNAs contain a high content of uridine and are, therefore, called U-RNAs; five different U-RNAs were defined on the basis of immunoprecipitation (U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6). Autoantibodies to these complexes are mainly directed to the protein components.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-Sm antibodies precipitate five proteins with molecular weights of 28,000 (B'B), 16,000 (D), 13,000 (E), 12,000 (F), and 11,000 (G); five of these polypeptides are common to the U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 RNAs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-RNP antibodies precipitate three proteins with molecular weights of 68,000 (70K), 33,000 (A'), and 22,000 (C); these polypeptides are <strong>uniquely</strong> associated with U1 RNA. The clinical correlates considered to be distinctive of MCTD are associated with the presence of antibodies with 70 kD specificity, with an immunodominant epitope embracing amino acid residue 125 flanked by important conformational residues at positions 119 to 126 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. On the other hand, SLE is associated with anti-Sm antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Heterogeneous nuclear RNP particles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hnRNPs contain pre-mRNA associated with about 30 small proteins that are all structurally related and that have molecular weights of 33 to 43 kD. Nine hnRNP core proteins have been designated A1, A2, B1a, B1b, B1c, B2, C1, C2, and C3.</p><p>Anti-RA33 antibodies are those that target the 33 kD hnRNP-A2 protein; increased concentrations of these autoantibodies are found in about one-third of sera from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), SLE, and MCTD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The antigenic epitopes of hnRNP-A2 contain two RNA binding regions at the N-terminal end and at a glycine rich C-terminal region. Antibodies in RA and SLE sera preferentially react with the complete second RNA binding domain, whereas MCTD sera target an epitope that spans both RNA binding domains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNE RECOGNITION OF INTRACELLULAR PARTICLES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Epitope spreading</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A T cell only responds to a small antigenic peptide fragment presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). T cells subsequently release cytokines that stimulate specific B cells to produce antibodies to the peptide fragment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76274\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76274 \">figure 1</a>). The antibody response to just one component of an intracellular structure, such as a spliceosome, will result in the uptake of the entire particle by APCs, which include B cells. Thus, all the proteins making up the particle will be subject to antigen processing with peptide presentation linked to their affinity to class II HLA antigens. Depending upon the polymorphisms of the host's HLA molecules, there will be a spreading of the antibody response to include some of these other antigens. This process is called &quot;epitope spreading&quot; and is a critical step in the development of linked antibody responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>For example, the induction of an immune response to one component of a U1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex can induce a diversified autoantibody response to other components of the complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69246\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69246 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. In this way, an immune response becomes modified over time, and this change has been associated with changes in the clinical picture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. As an example, a retrospective study found that epitope spreading occurred in 43 percent of patients with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), mainly during the first two years after diagnosis; this was associated with a significantly lower prevalence of skin sclerosis (0 versus 44 percent) and a greater prevalence of interstitial lung disease (46 versus 15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. After epitope spreading had occurred, arthritis (92 versus 25 percent) and muscle involvement (67 versus 17 percent) were less frequent. The mechanism whereby these &quot;hidden&quot; intracellular molecules become autoantigens is an area of ongoing research. The two main theories are apoptotic modification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and molecular mimicry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Apoptotic modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The biochemical hallmark of apoptosis is the cleavage of DNA into oligonucleotides that produce characteristic &quot;DNA ladders&quot; when separated on agarose gels. Interestingly, similar DNA ladders are found in the serum of lupus patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Although rheumatic disease autoantigens are not unified by common structure or function, they have the common feature of becoming clustered and concentrated in the surface blebs of apoptotic cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F71513\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71513 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. It is hypothesized that the cell surface translocation of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein protein particles (snRNP) during apoptosis facilitates the exposure of modified antigens to the immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Apoptosis generates modified proteins through cleavage with a class of enzymes called caspases. During the process of apoptosis, several enzyme systems are upregulated with resulting post-translational modifications of the cleaved proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. It is thought that these modifications, which include citrullination, phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, transglutamination, and conjugation to ubiquitin, render the molecules more antigenic. As an example, the U1 70 kD protein is specifically cleaved by the enzyme caspase-3, converting it into a C-terminally truncated 40 kD fragment which is still associated with U1 RNA and which preferentially induces a 70 kD immune response in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Antibodies to the apoptotically-cleaved U1 70 kD protein are more specific markers for mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) than those directed against the intact protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular mimicry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial stimulus for a first antibody response may be a nonself protein possessing a peptide region that mimics a self-epitope, so called molecular mimicry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Environmental stressors such as infection, toxins, drugs and ultraviolet light may, under some circumstances, induce accelerated apoptosis. The most likely environmental triggers are infectious agents that display self-like peptides. A critical limitation to molecular mimicry is the necessity for the antigenic sequence to undergo recognition via a T-cell receptor (TCR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Helper T lymphocytes (CD4+) usually recognize peptides of 12 to 16 amino acids in the context of HLA class II molecules. However, smaller peptides may be recognized, which in some instances are more immunostimulatory than the parent ligand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Such observations indicate that antigen recognition by T cells is highly degenerate and expands the potential for molecular mimicry, as the universe of molecules containing a pentapeptide is many-fold greater than for 12 amino residue peptide. If an infectious organism has a stretch of amino acids identical to an immunostimulatory peptide, an autoimmune response may result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Anti-U1 RNP antibodies display Ig class switching from IgM to IgG, as evidenced by variable region mutations, a feature that is typical of a T-cell dependent B-cell maturation response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The interaction of T-cell receptors and peptides presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules is a critical event in the generation of autoimmunity. The generation of autoimmunity in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), MCTD, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by differential degrees of epitope spreading. This may be related to the different HLA molecules associated with MCTD and SLE. The 70 kD anti-U1 RNP antibody response is associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">CD4/Th1</span> T cells. HLA-B*08 and DRB1*04:01 have been identified as risk alleles for MCTD, while DRB1*04:04, DRB1*13:01 and DRB1*13:02 were protective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

The clinical findings characteristic of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) are associated with the presence of antibodies with specificity for the 70 kD protein. In MCTD, U1-RNP antibodies have a predominant immunoglobulin (Ig)M isotype, whereas in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), they have a predominant IgG isotype. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Initiation of an autoantibody response'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmunity to spliceosomal components'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Small nuclear RNP particles'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Heterogeneous nuclear RNP particles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with MCTD may also have antibodies to heterogeneous nuclear RNP particles, which are another subunit of the spliceosome, and to the nucleosome. The former type of autoantibody may also be seen in patients either with rheumatoid arthritis or with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and the latter type may be seen in patients either with SLE or with systemic sclerosis. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmunity to nucleosomal components'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Heterogeneous nuclear RNP particles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modification and molecular mimicry have each been proposed as mechanisms by which intracellular molecules, such as components of U1 RNP, become autoantigens. Epitope spreading is a critical step in the linked and diversified anti-U1 RNP antibody response. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Epitope spreading'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Apoptotic modification'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Molecular mimicry'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vigorous innate and adaptive immune response resulting in anti-U1 RNP antibodies in patients with MCTD may result in hypergammaglobulinemia; the antibodies in these patients typically produce a very high titer speckled antinuclear antibody pattern. (See <a href=\"#H921221958\" class=\"local\">'Generation of U1 RNP autoimmunity in MCTD'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anti-u1-rnp-antibodies-in-mixed-connective-tissue-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Sharp GC, Irvin WS, Tan EM, et al.
