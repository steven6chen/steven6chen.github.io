(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacteriology-and-epidemiology-of-helicobacter-pylori-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacteriology and epidemiology of Helicobacter pylori infection&quot;</a>.). The bacterium generally does not invade gastroduodenal tissue. Instead, it renders the underlying mucosa more vulnerable to acid peptic damage by disrupting the mucous layer, liberating enzymes and toxins, and adhering to the gastric epithelium. In addition, the host immune response to <em>H. pylori</em> incites an inflammatory reaction which further perpetuates tissue injury.</p><p>The chronic inflammation induced by <em>H. pylori </em>upsets gastric acid secretory physiology to varying degrees and leads to chronic gastritis which, in most individuals is asymptomatic and does not progress (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63916%7EGAST%2F58872\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63916 graphicRef58872 \">picture 1A-B</a>). In some cases, however, altered gastric secretion coupled with tissue injury leads to peptic ulcer disease, while in other cases, gastritis progresses to atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and eventually gastric carcinoma or rarely, due to persistent immune stimulation of gastric lymphoid tissue, gastric lymphoma.

This interaction is influenced by the environment and modulated by a number of largely as yet unidentified factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The pathophysiology of <em>H. pylori</em> infection as it relates to gastrointestinal disease in general will be reviewed here.

Electron microscopy has confirmed the presence of tight adherence of <em>H. pylori</em> to the gastric cell surface through formation of membrane attachment pedestals similar to those described with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. This process requires that bacterial adhesins recognize and specifically bind to host receptors expressed on the cell surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The attachment process may morphologically or functionally alter the epithelial cell or activate certain bacterial functions making them more toxic. At the site of adherence, bacterial membrane proteins coded by genes contained in the cag pathogenicity island (PAI) open channels in the epithelial cell membrane that enable direct contact of bacterial factors with the cytoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Bacterial attachment is partially mediated by a number of adhesins and outer membrane proteins. Three Hop proteins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of <em>H. pylori</em> infection, BabA (HopS), OipA (HopH), and SabA (HopP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. BabA, the best characterized of the three adhesin proteins, mediates binding to fucosylated Lewis b (Le(b)) blood group antigens on host cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. OipA may serve as an adhesin but it also promotes inflammation by increasing IL-8 expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. SabA mediates binding to glycoconjugates containing sialic acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Replacement of nonsialylated Lewis antigens by sialylated Le(x) or Le(a) has been associated with <em>H. pylori</em> induced gastric inflammation and cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Thus, the role of Lewis antigen expression in bacterial attachment is unclear. Nevertheless, the homologous structures of <em>H. pylori</em> lipopolysaccharide and host LewisX antigen may lead to an autoimmune response with subsequent cell injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. <em>H. pylori</em> can also bind to class II MHC molecules on the surface of gastric epithelial cells and induce apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In fact, binding of the organism's urease to surface class II MHC is itself sufficient to induce apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. <em>H. pylori</em> modifies its lipid A in the outer membrane by removal of phosphate groups from the 1- and 4'-positions of the lipid A backbone. The enzyme responsible for dephosphorylation of the lipid A 4'-phosphate group in <em>H. pylori</em>, Jhp1487 (LpxF), has been identified and mutants created to demonstrate that dephosphorylation of the lipid A domain of <em>H. pylori</em> LPS by LpxE and LpxF is key to its ability to colonize the mammalian host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Release of enzymes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>H. pylori</em> elaborates several enzymes that can cause cellular damage by direct or indirect mechanisms.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urease accounts for over 5 percent of the organism's total protein weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

In addition, the urease enzyme itself is antigenic, activates the host immune system, and indirectly produces injury by stimulating inflammatory cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacterial phospholipases can alter the phospholipid content of the gastric mucosal barrier, changing its surface tension, hydrophobicity, and permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

All <em>H. pylori</em> contain the gene coding for VacA; however, only those strains that encode the cytotoxin-associated gene (cag) pathogenicity island (PAI), including cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), coding for a 128 to 140 kd protein (CagA), coexpress VacA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. VacA behaves as a passive urea transporter that is potentially capable of increasing the permeability of the gastric epithelium to urea, thereby creating a favorable environment for <em>H. pylori</em> infectivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Virulence of VacA appears to depend upon the function of a tyrosine phosphatase receptor in gastric epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. <em>H. pylori</em> strains with different VacA alleles have differing toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>CagA is not cytotoxic but is antigenic and can be detected serologically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Its function is unknown but, since it is necessary for VacA expression, it may play a role in transcription, excretion, or function of the VacA cytotoxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. <em>H. pylori</em> can translocate its CagA protein into gastric epithelial cells via a type IV secretory apparatus. There it is tyrosine phosphorylated and possibly plays a role in host cell responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].</p><p>Virulent strains of <em>H. pylori</em> encode cag PAI, which expresses a type IV secretion system (T4SS). This T4SS forms a syringe-like pilus structure for the injection of virulence factors such as the CagA effector protein into host target cells. This is achieved by a number of T4SS proteins, including CagI, CagL, CagY and CagA, which by itself binds the host cell integrin member &beta;(1) followed by delivery of CagA across the host cell membrane. CagA is not cytotoxic but is antigenic and can be detected serologically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A role of CagA interaction with phosphatidylserine has also been shown to be important for the injection process. After delivery, CagA becomes phosphorylated by oncogenic tyrosine kinases and mimics a host cell factor for the activation or inactivation of some specific intracellular signalling pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>]. </p><p>Strains producing VacA and CagA cause more intense tissue inflammation and induce cytokine production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/23,24,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24,33</a>]. Two other genes (picA and picB, now termed CagE) which are cotranscribed and genetically linked to cagA share homology with genes coding for toxins in other known pathogenic bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/23,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,34</a>]. The gene product of picB (CagE) induces the release of epithelial cytokines, including interleukin-8 (IL-8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/23,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,34</a>]. This effect appears to be mediated by nuclear factor kappa B, which activates transcription of IL-8 MRNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

The study included 247 <em>H. pylori</em> infected patients (86 with gastritis, 86 with a duodenal ulcer, and 75 with gastric carcinoma) in whom <em>H. pylori</em> isolates were tested for the other <em>H. pylori</em> virulence factors discussed above. On multivariate analysis, only oipA status remained an independent predictor of <em>H. pylori</em> density, mucosal inflammation, and high mucosal IL-8 levels. However, the actual biological significance of these observations is unknown.

Host polymorphism of IL-1 beta (and possibly IL-10) appears to determine the degree of inflammatory response to infection, resulting alteration in acid secretion (hyper or hypo secretion), and risk for subsequent gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. One series of meta-analyses investigated genes coding for the interleukin (IL) proteins (IL1B, IL1RN, IL8, and IL10) and for TNF-alpha. Gastric cancers were stratified by histologic subtype and anatomic subsite, by <em>H. pylori</em> infection status, by geographic location (Asian or non-Asian study population), and by a quantitative index of study quality. Results consistently supported increased cancer risk for IL1RN2 carriers; the increased risk was specific to non-Asian populations and was seen for intestinal and diffuse cancers, distal cancers, and, to a lesser extent, cardia cancers. In Asian populations, reduced risk was observed in association with IL1B-31C carrier status. These results indicate the importance of stratification by anatomic site, histologic type, <em>H. pylori</em> infection, and country of origin. Study quality considerations, both laboratory and epidemiologic, can also affect results and may explain, in part, the variability in results published to date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Interleukin-8 and other cytokines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Research has centered on epithelial IL-8 production induced by different strains of <em>H. pylori</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/36,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,67</a>]. IL-8 is a potent chemotactic factor, activates neutrophils, and recruits acute inflammatory cells into the mucosa. <em>H. pylori</em> appears to activate transcription factor NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa B), which in turn increases IL-8 production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/35,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,68</a>]. NF-kB also regulates the expression of additional inflammatory response genes, and may play a role in the mucosal epithelial response to other bacterial infections in addition to <em>H. pylori</em>.</p><p>Bacteria that express CagA and VacA are more potent inducers of IL-8; however, the gene primarily responsible for IL-8 induction is picB (now renamed CagE), which is located upstream of the CagA gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">CagA/VacA-positive</span> strains are also more often found in patients with clinical manifestations of <em>H. pylori</em> infection, indirectly suggesting that IL-8 may play an important pathophysiologic role in gastroduodenal disease.</p><p>TNF-alpha can also augment IL-8 production by the inflamed mucosa. Following successful eradication of <em>H. pylori</em>, mucosal levels of mRNA for both TNF-alpha and IL-8 are reduced in parallel with the decline in local inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p><em>H. pylori</em> infection increases IL-17 in the gastric mucosa of humans and experimental animals. IL-17 induces the secretion of IL-8 by activating the ERK <span class=\"nowrap\">1/2</span> MAP kinase pathway. IL-23 is also increased in patients with <em>H. pylori</em> related gastritis and regulates IL-17 secretion via the STAT3 pathway. The early events in the immune response of immunized and challenged mice include the recruitment of T cells and the production of IL-17. Neutrophil attracting chemokines are released, and the bacterial load is considerably reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. IL-17 plays a dual role in infection and vaccination. In infection, T regulatory cells (Tregs) suppress the inflammatory reaction driven by IL-17, thereby favoring bacterial persistence. Immunization produces Helicobacter-specific memory T-helper cells that can possibly alter the ratio between T-helper 17 and Treg responses so that the IL-17-driven inflammatory reaction can overcome the Treg response leading to bacterial clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>Virulent <em>H. pylori</em> strains that specifically activate signaling in epithelial cells via the innate immune molecule, nucleotide oligomerization domain 1 (NOD1), are more frequently associated with IFN-gamma-dependent inflammation and with severe clinical outcomes (ie, gastric cancer and peptic ulceration). <em>H. pylori</em> activation of the NOD1 pathway causes enhanced proinflammatory signaling in epithelial cells in response to IFN-gamma stimulation through the direct effects of <em>H. pylori</em> on two components of the IFN-gamma signaling pathway, STAT1 and IFN regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-and-immune-response-to-helicobacter-pylori-infection/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Survival of H. pylori</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>H. pylori</em> itself is in part able to survive this inflammatory onslaught by producing the enzyme, catalase.
