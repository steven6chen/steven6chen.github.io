A longitudinal survey was also performed; the average annual incidence of hypopituitarism was 4.2 cases of 100,000 (similar for men and women). In the second survey (which included most cases registered in the first survey), the causes of hypopituitarism included pituitary tumor (61 percent), nonpituitary tumor (9 percent), and a nontumor cause (30 percent).</p><p>A study of 773 adults with hypopituitarism found the following distribution of etiologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nontumoral causes (approximately 50 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pituitary tumors (43.6 percent) (hypopituitarism due to direct effects of the tumor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extrapituitary tumors (7.2 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523299073\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPOTHALAMIC DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any disease involving the hypothalamus can affect secretion of one or more of the hypothalamic hormones that influence secretion of corresponding pituitary hormones. Unlike diseases that involve the pituitary directly, any of these conditions can also diminish the secretion of vasopressin, resulting in diabetes insipidus. Pituitary lesions alone do not cause diabetes insipidus, since some vasopressin-producing neurons terminate in the median eminence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and causes of central diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523299106\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These include benign tumors that arise in the hypothalamus, such as craniopharyngiomas, and malignant tumors that metastasize there, such as lung and breast carcinomas.

Radiation-induced damage is usually due to injury at the level of the hypothalamus, which results in secondary deficiencies or dysregulation of the anterior pituitary hormones growth hormone (GH), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and corticotropin (ACTH).</p><p>Children treated with radiation doses &ge;18 Gy to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis are at risk for GH deficiency and central precocious puberty due to LH and FSH derangements. Those treated with doses &gt;30 to 40 Gy are at risk for deficiencies of LH, FSH, TSH, and ACTH.</p><p>The risk of pituitary dysfunction after cranial radiation is both dose- and time-dependent and may not become apparent until many years after treatment. It is likely that systematic, risk-based screening will uncover large numbers of previously undiagnosed hormonal deficiencies in at-risk adult survivors of childhood cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

It is more likely in immunocompromised patients, such as by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and high-dose glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1162920\"><span class=\"h2\">Traumatic brain injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Head trauma of sufficient severity to fracture the skull base can cause hypothalamic hormone deficiencies, resulting in deficient secretion of anterior pituitary hormones and vasopressin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A number of studies also report hormonal deficiencies associated with trauma that does not fracture the skull base, but the frequency of such deficiencies is difficult to determine because some of the criteria for diagnosis of decreased secretion are less stringent than generally used to diagnose hypopituitarism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-23</a>].

In the same review above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], pituitary function improved six weeks and six months after surgery in 26 and 36 percent of men who had been hypogonadal, 13 and 13 percent of women who had been hypogonadal, 30 and 49 percent of those who had been hypothyroid, and 3 and 3 percent of those who had been hypoadrenal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pituitary radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation of a pituitary adenoma, usually to prevent regrowth of residual tissue after surgery, exposes the nonadenomatous pituitary to the same radiation. In one report of 22 patients who received supervoltage radiation (46 Gy) of residual adenoma tissue after surgery, over 50 percent developed new corticotropin (ACTH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), or gonadotropin (luteinizing hormone <span class=\"nowrap\">[LH]/follicle-stimulating</span> hormone [FSH]) deficiency during the subsequent four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The results of other studies were similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>Because single high-dose radiation from a gamma or proton beam source or linear accelerator (stereotactic &quot;radiosurgery&quot;) is usually administered to a smaller volume of tissue than fractionated radiation, the expectation was that the risk of hypopituitarism would be less. However, these forms of radiation also cause a similar, high rate of hypopituitarism in the subsequent decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In a report based upon a prospective database of patients who had gamma radiation for acromegaly or Cushing's disease at least five years and a median of more than 13 years earlier, the actuarial rates of hypopituitarism at 3, 5, and 10 were 10, 21.7, and 53.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Because loss of any pituitary hormone can occur from a few months to at least 10 years after radiation, hormonal evaluation should be performed six months afterwards and then yearly.

It is initially characterized by lymphocytic infiltration and enlargement of the pituitary; this stage is followed by destruction of the pituitary cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>]. It often occurs in late pregnancy or the postpartum period. In a report of 16 patients, there were 14 women and two men; the clinical presentation was associated with pregnancy in 10 of the women. The frequent postpartum occurrence and the lymphocytic infiltration suggest that this disorder has an autoimmune etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. One report, however, showed a majority of patients whose diagnosis was independent of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Affected patients typically present with headaches of an intensity out of proportion to the size of the lesion and hypopituitarism.

Diabetes insipidus, hyperprolactinemia, growth hormone (GH) excess, and associated autoimmune thyroiditis can also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/11,44,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,44,49</a>].</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) typically reveal features of a pituitary mass, mimicking an adenoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/11,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,44</a>]. MRI also shows diffuse and homogeneous contrast enhancement of the anterior pituitary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], but enhancement may be delayed or even absent in the posterior pituitary area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The natural history typically involves progressive pituitary atrophy with replacement of pituitary tissue by fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].
