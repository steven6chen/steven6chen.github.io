This topic will review an approach to patients with refractory GERD. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and initial medical management of GERD are discussed in detail separately.

According to most experts, patients with GERD who exhibit partial or lack of response to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) twice daily are considered to have failed PPI therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-refractory-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. GERD in these patients is termed refractory GERD.

Most patients with GERD who do not respond to a PPI have either nonerosive reflux (NERD) or functional heartburn. In patients with NERD, the pooled symptomatic response rate to PPI once daily at four weeks is 37 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-refractory-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

The activity of CYP2C19 is determined to some extent by a genetic polymorphism. Approximately 5 percent of Caucasian patients and &gt;10 percent of Asians, are homozygous for a <em>CYP2C19</em> mutation (ie, slow metabolizers), potentially leading to greater suppression of gastric acidity. However, in wild type homozygotes (rapid metabolizers) the effect of PPIs on gastric acidity is diminished and may contribute to PPI failure.

In patients not on acid suppressive therapy, non-acid reflux results when gastric acid is buffered by the ingested food in the postprandial period.

The underlying mechanisms responsible for symptoms in functional heartburn remain to be elucidated. Increased esophageal sensitivity to chemical, mechanical, and electrical stimuli in this patient population has not been consistently demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-refractory-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>].

Rumination syndrome may also be misdiagnosed as GERD. Refractory GERD can be distinguished from these conditions by diagnostic testing. Patients with functional dyspepsia commonly also complain of heartburn which may be misdiagnosed as refractory GERD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-refractory-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

In a study that included 75 patients with persistent heartburn and regurgitation while on single-dose PPI therapy, seven patients (11 percent) had only pathological acid exposure, 25 (38 percent) had only pathological bile exposure, and 17 (26 percent) had pathological exposure to both acid and bile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-refractory-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Furthermore, in a carefully selected group of patients with symptoms refractory to PPI therapy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a> significantly reduced bile reflux exposure and heartburn. Although these studies suggest a role for measurement of bile reflux in patients with persistent reflux symptoms despite PPI therapy, bile reflux monitoring is not widely available.

Patients with continued symptoms should be carefully reassessed, paying specific attention to the type of ongoing symptoms, and the degree to which symptoms have improved or worsened. It is important to recognize that complete relief of heartburn with PPIs occurs at a rate of approximately 11.5 percent per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-refractory-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].
