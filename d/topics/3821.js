Although they are rare in the United States, these cancers are highly lethal because most are locally advanced at presentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-classification-of-cholangiocarcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and classification of cholangiocarcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, classification, and treatment of cholangiocarcinoma are discussed separately. Cancers of the gallbladder and ampulla of Vater are discussed as separate disease processes, although these structures are part of the biliary drainage system.

More recently, the term cholangiocarcinoma has been used to designate bile duct cancers arising in the intrahepatic, perihilar, or distal (extrahepatic) biliary tree, exclusive of gallbladder and ampulla of Vater (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52489\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52489 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Approximately 5 to 10 percent of cholangiocarcinomas are intrahepatic. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas can originate from either small intrahepatic ductules (peripheral cholangiocarcinomas) or large intrahepatic ducts proximal to the bifurcation of the right and left hepatic ducts. The extrahepatic bile ducts are divided into perihilar (including the confluence itself) and distal segments, with the transition occurring proximal to the cystic duct (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52489\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52489 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Cancers arising in the perihilar region, which account for 60 to 70 percent of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, have been further classified according to the pattern of involvement of the hepatic ducts (the Bismuth-Corlette classification) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75886\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75886 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Tumors involving the hepatic duct bifurcation (hilar cholangiocarcinomas) are collectively referred to as Klatskin tumors.</p><p>Type IV tumors, defined as tumor invasion of the second order biliary radicles bilaterally, are associated with a higher rate of positive surgical margins and significantly poorer overall survival after resection compared with types I to III [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The most recent (2017) revision of the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) classification no longer considers type IV tumors to represent a T4 primary tumor. (See <a href=\"#H62996685\" class=\"local\">'Tumor staging'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62994116\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas usually become symptomatic when the tumor obstructs the biliary drainage system. Symptoms related to biliary obstruction include jaundice, pruritus, clay-colored stools, and dark urine. Other common symptoms include abdominal pain (30 to 50 percent), weight loss (30 to 50 percent), and fever (up to 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The pain is generally described as a constant dull ache in the right upper quadrant. Malaise, fatigue, and night sweats may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Cholangitis is an unusual presentation. </p><p>Cholangiocarcinomas involving only the intrahepatic ducts (approximately 20 percent of all cholangiocarcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]) may present differently. Affected patients are less likely to be jaundiced. Instead, they usually have a history of dull right upper quadrant pain, weight loss, and an elevated alkaline phosphatase. Some patients are asymptomatic, with the lesions detected incidentally when imaging is obtained as part of the workup of abnormal liver blood tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], or during screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection and cirrhosis or in those with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. (See <a href=\"#H62994130\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory abnormalities'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are at an elevated risk for cholangiocarcinoma, especially perihilar disease. The development of cholangiocarcinoma in such patients is often heralded by rapid clinical deterioration with a declining performance status, jaundice, weight loss, and abdominal discomfort. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H57937294\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary sclerosing cholangitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Cholangiocarcinoma'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62994123\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On examination, patients with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma may have jaundice (90 percent), hepatomegaly (25 to 40 percent), a right upper quadrant mass (10 percent), or fever (2 to 14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A palpable gallbladder occurs rarely. A palpable gallbladder in a jaundiced patient (Courvoisier&rsquo;s sign or Courvoisier&rsquo;s law) was previously thought to be a sign of malignancy (pancreatic or biliary) rather than other causes of biliary obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, there are exceptions to this rule (eg, chronic pancreatitis, parasitic biliary obstruction, congenital choledochal cyst, common hepatic duct obstruction proximal to the takeoff of the cystic duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]), and the diagnostic utility of this physical examination finding is limited.

However, chronic biliary obstruction often leads to liver dysfunction and a pattern consistent with hepatocellular injury, with elevated transaminases and a prolonged prothrombin <span class=\"nowrap\">time/elevated</span> international normalized ratio (INR).</p><p>Patients with an intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma usually have abnormal levels of alkaline phosphatase, whereas serum bilirubin levels are usually normal or only slightly elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Elevated levels of 5'-nucleotidase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase confirm the hepatobiliary origin of the excess alkaline phosphatase. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-abnormal-liver-biochemical-and-function-tests#H173607816\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with abnormal liver biochemical and function tests&quot;, section on 'Confirming an elevated alkaline phosphatase is of hepatic origin'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis who are undergoing screening for cholangiocarcinoma may present only with an abnormally elevated serum level of the tumor marker carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9). (See <a href=\"#H349979518\" class=\"local\">'CA 19-9'</a> below.)</p><p>Rarely, patients with cholangiocarcinoma have findings associated with hypercalcemia of malignancy (hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, low parathyroid hormone levels, and low vitamin D levels) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In cases where ultrasound can't confirm a benign cause of biliary obstruction as the cause of jaundice, axial (cross-sectional) imaging (computed tomography [CT] scanning or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H89305876\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> below.)</p><p>Extrahepatic bile duct cancers may not be directly visualized, especially if small, but indirect signs (ductal dilatation) may point toward the diagnosis. An obstructing malignant lesion is suggested by ductal dilatation (&gt;6 mm in normal adults) in the absence of stones. Proximal extrahepatic lesions may cause dilation of the intrahepatic ducts alone, while both intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts are dilated with more distal lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H89305572\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound'</a> below.)</p><p>Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tumor growth patters include the mass-forming type, the periductal-infiltrating type with associated intrahepatic ductal dilation, and a mixed type. The purely mass-forming type is most common, accounting for approximately 60 percent of all intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, whereas the purely periductal and mixed types account for approximately 20 percent of cases each [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Mass lesions on imaging studies can be detected incidentally in cirrhotic patients undergoing HCC screening. Focal segmental bile duct dilation distal to an intrahepatic mass can be a highly suggestive feature of cholangiocarcinoma. </p><p>Mixed hepatocellular-cholangiocellular carcinoma, also referred to as primary liver carcinoma with biphenotypic differentiation, is a distinct subtype of cholangiocarcinoma that has a distinct appearance on cross sectional imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A strong enhancing rim and an irregular shape on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI favor a mixed tumor, while a lobulated shape, weak rim, and a target appearance favor a mass-forming intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. These mixed tumors are staged as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and not hepatocellular cancers.

The diagnosis should also be considered in patients found to have an isolated intrahepatic mass on imaging and a normal serum level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H65359554\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H421280764\" class=\"local\">'Alpha-fetoprotein'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients with PSC, cholangiocarcinoma should be considered if there is rapid clinical deterioration with jaundice, weight loss, and abdominal pain. The presence of progressive biliary dilatation in the setting of a dominant stricture or thickening of the bile duct wall should also raise a strong suspicion of cholangiocarcinoma. Cholangiocarcinoma should also be considered if screening tests (ie, carbohydrate antigen [CA] 19-9 <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography [MRCP]) are abnormal. (See <a href=\"#H349979518\" class=\"local\">'CA 19-9'</a> below and <a href=\"#H62996127\" class=\"local\">'MRI and MRCP'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management#H25107431\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary sclerosing cholangitis in adults: Management&quot;, section on 'Gallbladder carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65358694\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic approach varies depending on where the suspected lesion is (distal extrahepatic, perihilar, or intrahepatic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52489\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52489 \">figure 1</a>)) and if the patient has a history of PSC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F96374\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96374 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F96373\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96373 \">algorithm 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78245\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78245 \">algorithm 3</a>). All patients suspected of a cholangiocarcinoma should have tumor markers (CA 19-9, carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], and for patients with intrahepatic lesions, AFP) checked. With the caveat that biliary ductal obstruction alone can cause an elevation in CA 19-9, elevated tumor markers may support a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, or in the case of an elevated AFP, suggest an alternative diagnosis (hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]). If elevated, tumor markers may also be helpful in monitoring patients for recurrence after therapy. The role of assaying for serum IgG4 is unclear. A serum concentration of IgG4 can be obtained if IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis is in the differential diagnosis (eg, in a patient with autoimmune pancreatitis). (See <a href=\"#H349979459\" class=\"local\">'Tumor markers'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-igg4-related-disease#H16601923\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of IgG4-related disease&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>The location of the lesion is suggested by the patient&rsquo;s clinical presentation and the initial radiographic findings. Often, a patient will have undergone transabdominal ultrasound as part of the evaluation for jaundice. If a patient is suspected of having cholangiocarcinoma but has not undergone imaging (eg, in a patient who is found to have an elevated CA 19-9), the initial imaging test is typically a contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) <span class=\"nowrap\">scan/MRCP</span> or a multiphasic contrast-enhanced multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) scan. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography&quot;, section on 'Cholangiocarcinoma'</a> and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p>In some patients, the first test obtained may be an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

The diagnostic imaging evaluation is designed to eliminate benign tumors or gallstones from the differential diagnosis, to establish the location and extent of tumor invasion, and to determine if metastases have developed. The specific imaging tests obtained will depend upon the location of the tumor and if the patient has PSC. (See <a href=\"#H62996873\" class=\"local\">'Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62996743\"><span class=\"h3\">Suspected distal extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the patient with evidence of distal extrahepatic obstruction, EUS or ERCP is preferred as the next step in the evaluation, as the studies permit direct visualization of the area of abnormality, enable a biopsy (either fine-needle aspiration [FNA] or brush cytology), and in the case of ERCP, therapeutic intervention may also be possible (eg, stent placement). We generally start with an EUS unless the patient requires endoscopic drainage or if the lesion is not amenable to EUS-guided FNA because of its location. </p><p>We prefer EUS because ERCP involves injecting contrast into the bile duct, putting patients at risk for ascending cholangitis if there is impaired biliary drainage. However, patients undergoing FNA may be at risk of seeding the biopsy tract with malignant cells. If ERCP is performed, brush cytology should be obtained from any lesions or dominant strictures (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-fine-needle-aspiration-biopsy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract#H109379272\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy in the gastrointestinal tract&quot;, section on 'Safety'</a>). Intraductal ultrasound (IDUS), if available, can also be considered to help differentiate benign from malignant strictures. While not widely available, cholangioscopy can be performed to directly visualize the bile ducts and to biopsy indeterminant strictures.

It is not critical for planning surgery in potentially operable patients with characteristic findings of malignant biliary obstruction or a solitary intrahepatic mass and may not be necessary for planning palliative therapy, such as biliary drainage, in unresectable cases. In addition, FNA or <span class=\"nowrap\">CT/MRI-guided</span> biopsy can rarely result in seeding of the biopsy tract with malignant cells, which may preclude an otherwise eligible transplantation candidate from undergoing transplantation.

If there is no evidence of distant metastatic disease, extraregional lymph node involvement, or invasion of critical adjacent structures, we obtain a PET scan to look for occult metastases. If the PET scan is normal and the patient is a good surgical candidate, we proceed with laparoscopy.

Modern CT and MRI techniques almost always appropriately characterize portal vein or hepatic arterial involvement. However, if cross-sectional imaging is equivocal, duplex ultrasound (color Doppler) can be used to evaluate vascular involvement (ie, compression, encasement, or thrombosis of the portal vein; encasement or occlusion of the hepatic artery). Invasion into the portal vein or hepatic artery is an important finding, as in some cases it may be an indicator of unresectability.

Proximal lesions cause dilation of the intrahepatic ducts alone, while both intrahepatic and extrahepatic ducts are dilated with more distal lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Furthermore, the bile ducts may not be visibly dilated in cholangiocarcinomas with underlying PSC or cirrhosis. Nonetheless, the presence of progressive biliary dilatation in the setting of a dominant stricture or thickening of the bile duct wall in patients with PSC should raise a strong suspicion for cholangiocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>An important adjunct to diagnostic ultrasound is the ability to evaluate vascular involvement (ie, compression, encasement, or thrombosis of the portal vein, encasement or occlusion of the hepatic artery) using duplex ultrasound (color Doppler).

When an intrahepatic lesion is noted on an imaging study in the setting of cirrhosis, the next diagnostic step is differentiation between cholangiocarcinoma and HCC. Typical radiographic features of cholangiocarcinoma include a hypodense hepatic lesion that can be either well defined or infiltrative without a capsule, with biliary dilatation. The dense fibrotic nature of the tumor may cause capsular retraction, which is seen in up to one-fifth of cases. Following contrast administration, there is peripheral (rim) enhancement throughout both arterial and venous phases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/51,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,53</a>].

Unlike conventional ERCP, MRCP does not require contrast material to be administered into the ductal system. </p><p>MRCP has advantages over MDCT, as well. In addition to imaging the liver parenchyma and intrahepatic lesions, it can create a three-dimensional image of the biliary tree (allowing assessment of the bile ducts both above and below a stricture) and vascular structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73964\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73964 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72880\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72880 \">image 2</a>).

In a series comparing MRCP with ERCP in 40 patients with malignant perihilar obstruction, both techniques detected 100 percent of biliary obstructions.

However, one of the disadvantages of MRCP is that current technology does not allow any interventions to be performed, such as stone extraction, stent insertion, or biopsy.

Finally, MRCP requires dedicated radiology personnel and a high level of technical expertise. If at all possible, MRCP should be performed before biliary drainage since evaluation for biliary pathology is more difficult if the biliary tree is collapsed from a preceding biliary drainage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62994889\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopy and percutaneous cholangiography</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62995230\"><span class=\"h3\">Cholangiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholangiography involves injection of radiographic contrast material to opacify the bile ducts; it can be performed by ERCP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75950\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75950 \">image 3</a>) or via a percutaneous approach (percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography [PTC]).

The diagnostic yield is increased if the lesion in question is biopsied or brushings are taken from the duct for cytologic examination. Unfortunately, endoscopic brush cytology in patients who have clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiographic findings suggestive of malignancy has a limited sensitivity (35 to 69 percent), and the addition of endoscopic biopsy of malignant strictures increases this value only to 43 to 88 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/78-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-82</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H349979459\" class=\"local\">'Tumor markers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with PSC, we typically use a CA 19-9 cutoff value &ge;129 <span class=\"nowrap\">unit/mL</span> to increase suspicion for a cholangiocarcinoma, especially in the presence of a dominant hilar stricture. (See <a href=\"#H349979518\" class=\"local\">'CA 19-9'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional testing based on the tumor&rsquo;s suspected location and the clinical scenario includes:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Distal extrahepatic lesion &ndash; Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is preferred as the next step in the evaluation, as the studies permit direct visualization of the area of abnormality, enable a biopsy (either fine-needle aspiration [FNA] or brush cytology), and in the case of ERCP, therapeutic intervention may also be possible (eg, stent placement). We prefer EUS unless the patient requires endoscopic drainage or if the lesion is not amenable to EUS-guided FNA because of its location. (See <a href=\"#H62996743\" class=\"local\">'Suspected distal extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma'</a> above and <a href=\"#H62994889\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopy and percutaneous cholangiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Perihilar lesion &ndash; If <span class=\"nowrap\">MRCP/MDCT</span> fail to confirm the diagnosis, additional imaging with ERCP is the next step. (See <a href=\"#H62996750\" class=\"local\">'Suspected perihilar cholangiocarcinoma'</a> above and <a href=\"#H62996127\" class=\"local\">'MRI and MRCP'</a> above and <a href=\"#H89307230\" class=\"local\">'MDCT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intrahepatic lesion &ndash; Findings on cross-sectional imaging (MDCT scan or MRI) can differentiate between cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, provided the patient is not known to have or suspected of having an extrahepatic malignancy, in which case metastatic disease should be ruled out first (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78245\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78245 \">algorithm 3</a>). If the initial imaging test is nondiagnostic, the other imaging modality (CT or MRI) can then be obtained. (See <a href=\"#H62996757\" class=\"local\">'Suspected intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Solid liver lesions: Differential diagnosis and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with PSC, we start the evaluation with MRCP to document the segmental extent of ductal involvement, search for intrahepatic metastases, and identify aberrant ductal anatomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F96373\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96373 \">algorithm 2</a>). If the MRCP is nondiagnostic or if a dominant stricture is identified, we will obtain an ERCP with brush cytology (with or without intraductal ultrasound). (See <a href=\"#H62996873\" class=\"local\">'Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">If both of these tests are nondiagnostic, we suggest PET scan. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'PET scan'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Even after extensive diagnostic work-up, surgical exploration may be required to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tissue diagnosis can be obtained by a variety of means in patients suspected of having cholangiocarcinoma (brush cytology, FNA, CT, or MRI-guided biopsy). The necessity of establishing a tissue diagnosis prior to surgery depends upon the clinical situation. It is not critical for planning surgery in patients with characteristic findings of malignant biliary obstruction and may not be necessary for planning palliative therapy, such as biliary drainage, in unresectable cases. In addition, FNA or <span class=\"nowrap\">CT/MRI-guided</span> biopsy can rarely result in seeding of the biopsy tract with malignant cells, which may preclude an otherwise eligible transplantation candidate from undergoing transplantation. Therefore, in patients with perihilar tumors, the case should be discussed with the transplantation team prior to proceeding with tissue sampling. (See <a href=\"#H62996594\" class=\"local\">'Need for tissue diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Separate tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging classifications are available for distal, perihilar, and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110943\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110943 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110944\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110944 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110945 \">table 3</a>).
