Peptic ulcers may present with dyspeptic or other gastrointestinal symptoms, or may be asymptomatic and present with complications such as hemorrhage or perforation. This topic will review the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease. The etiology, complications, and management of peptic ulcer disease are discussed in detail, separately.

Approximately 80 percent of patients with endoscopically diagnosed ulcers have epigastric pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Occasionally the discomfort localizes to the right or left upper quadrants of the hypochondrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Radiation of pain to the back may occur, but back pain as the primary symptom is atypical. In untreated patients, symptoms can last a few weeks followed by symptom-free periods of weeks or months. The &quot;classic&quot; pain of duodenal ulcers occurs two to five hours after a meal when acid is secreted in the absence of a food buffer and at night (between about 11 PM and 2 AM) when the circadian stimulation of acid secretion is maximal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Patients with peptic ulcers, and particularly pyloric channel ulcers, may have food-provoked symptoms due to visceral sensitization and gastroduodenal dysmotility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These symptoms include epigastric pain that worsens with eating, postprandial belching and epigastric fullness, early satiety, fatty food intolerance, nausea, and occasional vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1886858375\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 70 percent of peptic ulcers are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients with silent peptic ulcers may later present with ulcer related complications. Between 43 and 87 percent of patients with bleeding peptic ulcers present without antecedent dyspepsia or other heralding gastrointestinal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7</a>].

Symptoms of gastric retention include early satiety, bloating, indigestion, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain shortly after eating, and weight loss.

Patients with penetrating ulcers often present with a change in symptoms due to symptomatic involvement of adjacent structures. The pain typically becomes more intense, of longer duration, and is frequently referred to the lower thoracic or upper lumbar spine region. Penetrating posterior ulcers classically present with a shift from the typical vague visceral discomfort to a more localized and intense pain that is felt in the back and is not relieved by food or antacids. This change in symptom pattern may be gradual or sudden.</p><p>Gastrocolic or duodenocolic fistulas can present with halitosis, feculent vomiting, postprandial diarrhea, dyspepsia, and weight loss. Other rare complications include perivisceral abscess and erosion into vascular structures leading to exsanguinating hemorrhage (eg, aortoenteric fistula or erosion into the cystic artery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Rare biliary tract complications of peptic ulcers include erosion into the biliary tree with choledochoduodenal fistula, extrahepatic biliary obstruction, or hemobilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Fistulization into the pancreatic duct has also been reported with penetrating duodenal ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Mild hyperamylasemia can develop with posterior penetration of either a gastric or duodenal ulcer, but clinical pancreatitis is uncommon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1801518852\"><span class=\"h3\">Perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ulcer perforation should be suspected in patients who suddenly develop severe, diffuse abdominal pain. Perforations complicate 2 to 10 percent of patients with peptic ulcer disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Duodenal, antral, and gastric body ulcers account for 60, 20, and 20 percent of perforations due to peptic ulcer disease, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Prepyloric ulcerations account for most perforations followed by duodenal perforations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Laparoscopic techniques to repair perforations may reduce mortality.

However, patients may have iron deficiency anemia due to gastrointestinal blood loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1886862092\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease is suspected in patients with dyspepsia, especially in the setting of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use or a history of <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> infection. While contrast imaging is not needed to diagnose peptic ulcer disease, if performed, it may be supportive of the diagnosis. The diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease is definitively established by direct visualization of the ulcer on upper endoscopy. However, the need to pursue a definitive diagnosis in patients who have undergone contrast imaging depends upon the clinical setting. In patients with benign-appearing duodenal ulcers identified on radiologic imaging and no alarm features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56585\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56585 \">table 1</a>), endoscopy is not required to establish the diagnosis. In contrast, all patients diagnosed with gastric ulceration on radiologic imaging should undergo an upper endoscopy. However, the timing of the upper endoscopy may be deferred to 12 weeks after therapy in the absence of alarm features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1279661632\"><span class=\"h2\">Upper endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On upper endoscopy, benign gastric and duodenal ulcers have smooth, regular, rounded edges, with a flat, smooth ulcer base often filled with exudate. Endoscopy is the most accurate diagnostic test for peptic ulcer disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F103830\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef103830 \">picture 2</a>). The sensitivity of upper endoscopy in the detection of gastroduodenal lesions is approximately 90 percent but varies based on the location of the ulcer and the experience of the endoscopist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Some endoscopic features that suggest that an ulcer may be malignant include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An ulcerated mass protruding into the lumen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Folds surrounding the ulcer crater are nodular, clubbed, fused, or stop short of the ulcer margin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overhanging, irregular, or thickened ulcer margins</p><p/><p>All ulcers with malignant features should be biopsied. Routine biopsy of benign-appearing duodenal ulcers is not recommended, as they are unlikely to be malignant. When duodenal involvement due to Crohn disease is suspected, biopsy of the duodenal ulcer is indicated.</p><p>If permissible, we obtain biopsies from four quadrants of the ulcer. If endoscopic features suspicious for malignancy are present such as nodularity at the edges of the ulcer or infiltration of the surrounding tissue creating a heaped up appearance at the edge of the ulcer, we obtain biopsies using jumbo forceps with more extensive sampling along the edges of the ulcer. Cytology adds little to the diagnostic yield and is not routinely recommended. However, the decision to biopsy benign-appearing gastric ulcers is controversial and should be individualized. For example, in the United States, it is not necessary to biopsy small antral ulcers in young individuals taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In other parts of the world with a high incidence of gastric cancer, biopsy of all gastric ulcers may be reasonable. We generally biopsy benign-appearing gastric ulcers at the index upper endoscopy as they may harbor malignancy; other experts do not biopsy gastric ulcers if the patient's history and demographic features suggest a low risk of gastric cancer (eg, a young patient with a history of NSAID use and a shallow flat antral ulcer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-staging-of-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5281572\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography performed for the evaluation of abdominal pain can identify non-perforated peptic ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].<a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Barium</a> radiography is infrequently used for the diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease because of the widespread availability of endoscopy, the desire to limit radiation exposure to patients, and limitations inherent to radiography, such as the inability to biopsy for <em>H. pylori</em> testing and histopathology. Decreasing expertise with barium radiography is also a concern in many institutions. On barium radiography, an ulcer niche is generally round or oval and may be surrounded by a smooth mound of edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Secondary changes of a gastric ulcer include folds radiating to the crater and deformities in the region secondary to spasm, edema, and scarring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76712\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76712 \">image 1</a>). Secondary signs of duodenal ulcer include deformity of the duodenal bulb that may be evidenced by flattening of the superior or inferior fornices, eccentricity of the pyloric channel, pseudodiverticula, or exaggerated outpouching of recesses at the base of the bulb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The sensitivity of barium radiography depends on the size and location of the ulcer, the technique, and expertise in upper gastrointestinal radiography. Approximately 80 percent of duodenal ulcers can be detected with procedures using double contrast, compression, or hypotonic duodenography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. However, shallow lesions &lt;0.5 cm in diameter and those adjacent to a deformed duodenal bulb or edematous mucosal folds may be missed. False positive results occur when barium is trapped between folds. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1886862751\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTABLISHING THE ETIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1886863224\"><span class=\"h2\">Test for Helicobacter pylori</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease should undergo testing for <em>H. pylori</em> infection.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, patients diagnosed with peptic ulcers on upper endoscopy should undergo endoscopic biopsy of the stomach. Biopsy urease testing may be performed in patients who are not on antibiotics or a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Other options to diagnose <em>H. pylori</em> infection include the urea breath test and stool antigen tests. However, patients who are taking PPIs can have false negative breath tests and stool tests.

However, the urea breath test should be performed as early during the hospitalization as possible, as the sensitivity decreases with the increasing duration of antisecretory therapy. Stool <em>H. pylori</em> antigen tests lack specificity when blood is present in the stool due to cross reactivity with blood constituents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Patients who test positive should be started on treatment before leaving the hospital. In patients who are seronegative, follow-up <em>H. pylori</em> testing should be performed in four weeks, especially if the initial testing was performed in the presence of active gastrointestinal bleeding and the absence of a cause for ulcer disease (eg, NSAID use).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who receive treatment for <em>H. pylori,</em> eradication of infection should be confirmed four or more weeks after the completion of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/peptic-ulcer-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Although we biopsy benign-appearing gastric ulcers at the index upper endoscopy as they may harbor malignancy, other experts do not biopsy gastric ulcers if the patient's history and demographic features suggest a low risk of gastric cancer (eg, young patient with a history of NSAID use and a shallow flat antral ulcer). (See <a href=\"#H1886862092\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease should undergo testing for <em>H. pylori</em> infection. Additional evaluation to determine the underlying etiology should be considered when <em>H. pylori</em> and NSAID use have been excluded (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75002\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75002 \">table 2</a>).
