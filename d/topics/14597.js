It is associated with high rates of medical and psychiatric comorbidity as well as early mortality. The psychiatric diagnoses, alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence, in DSM-IV-TR were replaced by one diagnosis, alcohol use disorder, in DSM-5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-treatment-of-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Psychosocial treatments can reduce alcohol consumption and increase abstinence, either alone or in conjunction with pharmacologic treatment.

Most clinical trials of treatments for alcohol disorders were conducted in samples of patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of alcohol dependence. These trial results can be most accurately applied to patients with a moderate to severe alcohol use disorder under DSM-5 criteria. DSM-IV alcohol abuse is comparable to the mild subtype of alcohol use disorder in DSM-5.

This corresponds to 12 fluid ounce of regular beer, 5 fluid ounce of wine, and 1.5 fluid ounce of 80-proof distilled spirit.</p><p>Criteria for at-risk drinking may be modified by comorbidities, especially in the older population. Increased mortality risk has been demonstrated for older patients who are at-risk drinkers, as defined by the CARET (Comorbidity-Alcohol Risk Evaluation Tool) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-treatment-of-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Any drinking can be considered &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; for pregnant women, for those who take medications that interact with alcohol, or for those with a health condition that can be caused or exacerbated by alcohol (eg, hepatitis C).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H202099990\"><span class=\"h2\">&quot;Binge&quot; drinking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&ldquo;Binge&rdquo; or heavy episodic drinking is an important subset of at-risk drinking, particularly in teenagers and young adults.

This is an area of controversy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-treatment-of-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Controlled drinking is probably more likely for people with a mild disorder (or at-risk drinking) and not for a more severe disorder. Advocates for a &ldquo;harm reduction&rdquo; approach as an alternative to abstinence may acknowledge that abstinence is the best outcome, but that not every individual achieves this end, and that controlled drinking for some individuals is an achievable aim which reduces risk to patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13088973\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERVENTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Motivational interviewing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Motivational interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based counseling technique for eliciting behavior change by helping the patient explore and resolve ambivalence about change. </p><p>A 2011 meta-analysis examined 59 randomized trials with a total of 13,342 adult participants with DSM-IV substance abuse or dependence; 29 trials were specific to alcohol abuse and dependence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-treatment-of-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Motivational interviewing reduced substance use over the course of the trial (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.79, 95% CI 0.48-1.09) and at subsequent follow-up of up to 12 months (SMD = 0.15, 95% CI 0.04-0.25) compared with a control condition. No differences in efficacy were seen for motivational interviewing by type of substance. No difference in substance use was seen when motivational interviewing was compared with treatment as usual for substance use disorders (SUDs), other active treatments, and receiving substance abuse assessment and feedback. </p><p>Motivational enhancement therapy (MET), a four-session variant of motivational interviewing, includes structured assessment of the patient&rsquo;s substance use, measures of substance use harm, and personalized risk feedback [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-treatment-of-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>These interventions are described in detail separately.

For other drugs, randomized trials have had mixed results for the efficacy of screening and brief intervention in primary care and in other settings, including inpatient care and emergency departments, though the most recent and highest quality studies suggest lack of efficacy.

Increased cognitive awareness is combined with techniques to help patients develop new and adaptive ways of behaving and alter their social environment, which in turn leads to change in thoughts and emotions. </p><p>A meta-analysis of 53 trials found CBT to have a modest positive effect on outcomes for alcohol and other drug dependence compared to control conditions and no treatment. Comparable results were seen across most categories of illicit substances, including alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-treatment-of-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Studies have generally not found the combination of CBT and medications for alcohol dependence to improve outcomes more than either intervention individually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-treatment-of-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>A brief, CBT-based intervention has shown effectiveness in helping people with alcohol abuse or dependence to initiate treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-treatment-of-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A randomized trial compared a single-session, telephone-based CBT intervention to a control condition in 196 participants who screened positive for a possible alcohol use disorder. Subjects receiving the intervention had improved attitudes towards addiction treatment and were three times more likely to attend an alcohol treatment program within three months than patients in the control group (31 versus 12 percent). </p><p>Cognitive and behavioral therapies for substance use disorders are reviewed separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13089628\"><span class=\"h2\">Residential treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Residential programs provide a 24-hour, drug and alcohol-free environment. They vary widely in the intensity of clinical services provided and the treatment models employed. As examples, three models of residential treatment have been identified:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A psychosocial model &ndash; Emphasizing individual and group counseling, social skills training, and mutual help groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A supportive rehabilitative model &ndash; Adds work training and other specialized rehabilitative services to services provided by the prior model.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An intensive treatment model &ndash; Adds medical and psychiatric services, <span class=\"nowrap\">couples/family</span> counseling, and nutritional counseling to services provided by the prior models.</p><p/><p>There are no well designed clinical trials comparing the effectiveness of residential treatment for alcohol use disorder to treatment at lower levels of care. In our clinical experience, residential treatment can be beneficial for patients with a moderate to severe alcohol use disorder who have not succeeded in maintaining abstinence at a less intensive level of treatment (eg, an intensive outpatient program). Residential treatment can also be beneficial for patients at very high risk if they are not removed from their environment, such as patients who are homeless or pregnant, or who only have substance-using <span class=\"nowrap\">friends/family</span>. The availability of residential treatment varies widely, and may not be covered by health insurance.</p><p>The intensity of care for SUDs across levels of care is reviewed separately.

Although there are differences among them, they commonly emphasize working toward abstinence through group sharing and support.</p><p>Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), the best known program, is a voluntary program for people with an alcohol use disorder, based on fellowship and a belief in a spiritual basis for recovery. Abstinence is encouraged on a &quot;one day at a time&quot; basis. Members attend meetings (either open to all, or restricted to participants with alcoholism) in which experiences related to drinking and recovery are shared, and steps in the &ldquo;Twelve Steps to Recovery&rdquo; are discussed. Participation in AA entails acknowledgment that alcohol has led to loss of control, and that recovery is a spiritual journey through belief in a higher power, and through personal exploration and acceptance. More information about AA can be found on their website: <a href=\"http://www.aa.org/&amp;token=MBqFDJVwKhE1NUmvp56dqzfZiarIV2exRflqDZ2If3g=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7810\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.aa.org</a>.</p><p>Meta-analyses of trials of AA participation by patients with alcohol use disorders have reported multiple methodologic problems and heterogenous outcomes.

Several trials had limited generalizability due to coerced participation in AA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-treatment-of-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing AA and other twelve-step approaches to other psychosocial interventions found few differences in treatment retention and drinking outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-treatment-of-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The physician can take an active role referring a patient to a program, for example, by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Making the first call with the patient present</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Helping to locate meeting sites</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identifying times for the patient to attend </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Requesting that the patient provide feedback to the physician after attending meetings</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discussing common misconceptions about AA (eg, that medications are prohibited; that it is a religious group) </p><p/><p>For patients who prefer a mutual help group without AA&rsquo;s emphasis on the role of a higher power, alternative support programs are available. One such program is SMART Recovery (Self Management and Recovery Training), which offers free treatment advice online as well as group meetings which stress self-reliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-treatment-of-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. For those who prefer to attempt controlled drinking, self-help groups are available with both group meetings and internet support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-treatment-of-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13089332\"><span class=\"h2\">Contingency management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contingency management interventions for substance use disorders (SUDs) offer incentives to encourage abstinence or discourage substance use. Several small randomized clinical trials have found contingency management to reduce alcohol use in patients with DSM-IV alcohol dependence or heavy drinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-treatment-of-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. As an example, a clinical trial randomly assigned 30 adults with heavy drinking to receive three weeks of either daily contingency management or daily noncontingent reinforcement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-treatment-of-alcohol-use-disorder/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Patients assigned to contingency management had a higher proportion of days with no drinking detected using a transdermal alcohol sensor (54.3 versus 31.2 percent). These trials used breath alcohol or ethyl glucuronide testing (short term), or transdermal alcohol testing (technology is available but in early stages and not widely so).

More intensive programs are aimed at patients with more severe alcohol use disorder as well as greater functional impairment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medical or psychiatric comorbidity. (See <a href=\"#H13089628\" class=\"local\">'Residential treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-appropriate-levels-of-care-for-treatment-of-substance-use-disorders#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining appropriate levels of care for treatment of substance use disorders&quot;, section on 'Residential services'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutual help groups, including 12-step programs and other models, are a common component of treatment for alcohol use disorder. Although there are differences among them, they commonly emphasize working toward abstinence through group sharing and support. Clinical trials of mutual help groups for alcohol use disorder have had multiple limitations and have resulted in heterogeneous outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H202100765\" class=\"local\">'Mutual help groups'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contingency management, which offers incentives to discourage substance use and encourage abstinence, has been found to be efficacious for patients with DSM-IV alcohol dependence or heavy drinking in several small randomized trials. Contingency management if feasible can be added to group addiction counseling or psychotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H13089332\" class=\"local\">'Contingency management'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contingency-management-for-substance-use-disorders-theoretical-foundation-principles-assessment-and-components\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contingency management for substance use disorders: Theoretical foundation, principles, assessment, and components&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contingency-management-for-substance-use-disorders-efficacy-implementation-and-training\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contingency management for substance use disorders: Efficacy, implementation, and training&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients with alcohol use disorder will experience the condition as chronic or recurrent. For this reason, emerging evidence-based treatment models emphasize continuing care. Such models customize treatment to individual needs and preferences, modify the intensity of treatment (frequency and number of modalities) with the waxing and waning of substance use over time, teach patients self-management skills, foster linkages to other sources of support, and use data to measure and monitor patient clinical status.
