Although most newborns remain asymptomatic despite very low blood glucose concentrations, some newborns become symptomatic at the same or even higher blood glucose concentrations than are observed in asymptomatic infants. This variability in the clinical response in neonates to low blood glucose concentrations is due to a number of factors that include the infant's gestational age and postnatal age, the presence of other sources of energy (eg, lactate and ketone bodies), and circumstances that affect glucose metabolism and cerebral glucose uptake and utilization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of outcome data &minus; Ideally, clinically significant neonatal hypoglycemia would be defined as the blood glucose concentration at which intervention should be initiated to avoid significant morbidity, especially neurologic sequelae. However, this definition remains elusive because the blood glucose concentration and duration of hypoglycemia associated with poor neurodevelopmental outcome has not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-screening-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A large prospective study was undertaken of newborns (gestational age &ge;35 weeks) at risk for hypoglycemia (ie, maternal diabetes, large for gestational age, fetal growth restriction, and prematurity [gestational age &lt;37 weeks]) (see <a href=\"#H179706548\" class=\"local\">'Who should be evaluated?'</a> below) who underwent regular measurements of blood glucose for up to 48 hours of life and were treated to maintain blood glucose concentrations greater than 47 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.61 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> regardless of postnatal age. Neurodevelopmental outcome at two years of age was similar between infants in whom intervention was provided for hypoglycemia compared with those without evidence of hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-screening-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, at 4.5 years of age follow-up assessment demonstrated that children with treated neonatal hypoglycemia had poorer executive and visual motor functions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-screening-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Of note, despite intensive capillary blood glucose monitoring, 25 percent of the infants had levels below the targeted level for at least five hours as detected by continuous interstitial glucose monitoring (which was masked to the clinical providers). These results do <strong>not</strong> provide a definitive threshold for treating neonatal hypoglycemia in all newborns.</p><p/><p>Nevertheless, most guidelines used in clinical practice provide arbitrary treatment thresholds of blood glucose concentrations to initiate intervention and bypass the controversies surrounding the definition of hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-screening-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. This approach tries to reduce the harm due to hypoglycemia, identify newborns with a serious underlying hypoglycemia disorder, and at the same time, minimize overtreatment of newborns with normal transitional low glucose concentrations that resolve without intervention. This has resulted in guidelines that favor simplicity and ease of use over an emphasis on the physiology of normal neonatal glucose homeostasis, the normal age-related increase in glucose concentrations over the first few days of life, and the varying pathophysiological conditions that may lead to clinical hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-outcome-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and outcome of neonatal hypoglycemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When using guidelines based on low glucose concentrations, it is important to recognize that glucose concentrations measured in whole blood are approximately 15 percent lower than those in plasma and may be further reduced if the hematocrit is high. In addition, when reviewing the literature and guidelines one must be careful to note whether the normal values are mean glucose values (used in this topic review), as opposed to using a threshold range of glucose values (below the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile used in the American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP] guidelines). (See <a href=\"#H137432953\" class=\"local\">'How glucose testing is performed'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15596030\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL TRANSITIONAL LOW GLUCOSE LEVELS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient low blood glucose concentrations in neonates are normal, as the source of glucose at delivery changes from a continuous supply from the mother to an intermittent supply from milk feeds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-screening-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. With loss of the continuous transplacental supply of glucose, plasma glucose concentration in the healthy term newborn falls during the first two hours after delivery, reaching a nadir that usually is no lower than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> and then stabilizes by four to six hours of age in the range of 45 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.5 to 4.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-screening-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia/abstract/1,2,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,7,8</a>]. Mean concentrations then rise more slowly in the next few days to concentrations similar to those seen in older children and adults.</p><p>Immediately after birth, the plasma glucose concentration is maintained by the breakdown of hepatic glycogen (glycogenolysis) in response to increased plasma epinephrine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glucagon</a> concentrations, and falling insulin levels. Glycogen stores are depleted during the first 8 to 12 hours of life. Thereafter, plasma glucose levels are maintained by the synthesis of glucose from lactate, glycerol, and amino acids (gluconeogenesis). As feeds with adequate carbohydrate are established, maintenance of plasma glucose concentrations is no longer solely dependent on gluconeogenesis. However, if the first feeding is delayed for three to six hours after birth, approximately 10 percent of normal term newborns cannot maintain a plasma glucose concentration above 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-screening-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypoglycemia/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGIC AND/OR PERSISTENT HYPOGLYCEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypoglycemia is caused by a lower rate of glucose production than glucose utilization.

In this setting, it is postulated that intermittent maternal hyperglycemia causes fetal hyperglycemia, which leads to hypertrophied and hyperfunctioning beta cells resulting in fetal and neonatal hyperinsulinemia. After termination of the maternal glucose supply at delivery, hypoglycemia from persistent hyperinsulinism in the newborn usually is transient and typically resolves two to four days after birth.
