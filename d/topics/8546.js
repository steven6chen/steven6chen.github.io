Most cases of periodic paralysis are hereditary, usually with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Acquired cases of hypokalemic PP have been described in association with hyperthyroidism. The clinical features of these disorders are summarized in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65215\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65215 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Hypokalemic PP and the periodic paralysis associated with the Andersen syndrome will be reviewed here. Other causes of periodic paralysis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (PP) is the most common of the periodic paralyses, but is still quite rare, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Hypokalemic PP may be familial with autosomal dominant inheritance or may be acquired in patients with thyrotoxicosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyrotoxic-periodic-paralysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinical penetrance is often incomplete, especially in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The disorder is three to four times more commonly clinically expressed in men. Approximately one-third of cases represent new mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A mutation in the gene that codes for the alpha-1 subunit of the dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel in skeletal muscle is the most common genetic abnormality in hypokalemic PP and is found in about 70 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. A mutation in the skeletal muscle sodium channel, SCN4A, is responsible for this syndrome in other families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Families with the latter mutation demonstrate more complete clinical penetrance, affecting men and women equally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Kindreds with hypokalemic PP who have neither of these defects have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>It is not known how the calcium channel defect leads to episodic potassium movement into the cells and causes weakness. The following observations hint at possible aspects of an underlying mechanism:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrophysiologic studies have found a decreased calcium current density as well as slower rate of activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/11,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,18,19</a>]. However, calcium movement is not clearly responsible for either altered potassium fluxes or clinical symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to calcium conductance, the dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel has been shown to also act as a voltage sensor for excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Investigators have found that hypokalemic PP is associated with a reduced sarcolemmal ATP-sensitive potassium current [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This finding can be tied to the clinical manifestations of hypokalemic PP, but the relationship with the primary calcium channel defect is unclear. The investigators suggest the possibility of a secondary, calcium-sensitive channelopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In vitro studies showed that blocking the dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel in muscle fibers from patients with hypokalemic PP does not prevent insulin-induced membrane depolarization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This is also consistent with a secondary channelopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p>The mechanism of paralysis in patients with sodium channel defect is better understood. Mutant sodium channels produce an anomalous gating pore current that may cause aberrant depolarization during attacks of weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with all the periodic paralyses, attacks occur suddenly with generalized weakness. Consciousness is preserved and bulbar and respiratory muscles are only mildly affected, if at all.</p><p>In hypokalemic PP, attacks begin in late childhood or teenage years. These attacks vary in frequency and duration. Intervals of weeks to months are common, but some patients experience several attacks per week. Attacks typically last several hours, but the duration can range from minutes to days. Attacks may be triggered by rest after vigorous exercise, stress, or a high-carbohydrate meal, often after a delay of several hours. These events are often associated with an increased release of epinephrine or insulin, both of which cause movement of potassium into cells and low potassium blood levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. One patient with known hypokalemic PP developed acute weakness after using an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a> inhaler [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Neurologic examination during an attack demonstrates weakness, usually affecting proximal more than distal muscles, and the legs more than the arms; hyporeflexia or areflexia is typical. Between attacks, the neurologic examination is usually normal; the myotonia typical of hyperkalemic PP is not a feature of hypokalemic PP. Some patients experience a milder degree of weakness between attacks that fluctuates and improves with mild exercise.</p><p>The mean plasma potassium concentration during the attack in one series was 2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Levels can be as low as 1.5; however, concentrations less than 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> should suggest a secondary cause of hypokalemic paralysis, such as that seen in some cases of severe hypokalemia due to distal renal tubular acidosis. Between attacks, potassium levels normalize in hypokalemic PP, but remain low in secondary hypokalemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-pathophysiology-of-renal-tubular-acidosis-and-the-effect-on-potassium-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and pathophysiology of renal tubular acidosis and the effect on potassium balance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cardiac arrhythmias, such as tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation are not common but have been reported during attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. During attacks, the ECG may otherwise show findings consistent with hypokalemia, including depression of the ST segment, decrease in the amplitude of the T wave, and an increase in the amplitude of U waves. (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73888\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef73888 \">waveform 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-miscellaneous-diagnoses#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Miscellaneous diagnoses&quot;, section on 'Hypokalemia'</a>.)</p><p>A progressive proximal myopathy ultimately develops in most patients with hypokalemic PP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This becomes clinically manifest in most individuals after the age of 50 years, as attacks of paralysis wane. Evidence of muscle disease may be evident on muscle biopsy or computed tomography scans several years before it manifests clinically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Clinically and pathologically, the myopathy is most profound in muscles of the pelvic girdle as well as the proximal upper and lower extremities. The severity of the myopathy is variable; patients may be only mildly affected or severely disabled. While a correlation between the severity of the myopathy and the number of paralytic attacks is suggested by some, there is little evidence to support this, and in at least one family, this association was not found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/26,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28-30</a>].</p><p>Some suggest that hypokalemic PP associated with sodium channel abnormalities is phenotypically as well as genetically distinct from the calcium channel disorder, with more prominent myalgias, a younger age of onset, shorter duration of attacks, and less severe myopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16</a>]. Also, tubular aggregates rather than vacuoles are more frequently observed on muscle biopsy and worsening rather than improvement of symptoms with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a> occur in some, but not all, patients with the sodium channel variant of hypokalemic PP. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Preventive treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypokalemic PP must be distinguished from other causes of periodic paralysis, which are discussed separately. In particular, paralytic attacks in thyrotoxicosis and in the Andersen syndrome can be associated with hypokalemia and must be explicitly excluded because treatment and preventive strategies are different in these disorders. The distinguishing clinical features of these disorders are summarized in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65215\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65215 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Andersen syndrome'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperkalemic-periodic-paralysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic manifestations of hyperthyroidism and Graves' disease&quot;, section on 'Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis'</a>.)</p><p>Other disorders that can cause intermittent muscle weakness include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myasthenia gravis. Weakness in myasthenia gravis typically occurs predictably in the setting of milder degrees of exertion, does not occur in &quot;attacks&quot; as does periodic paralysis, and often involves bulbar and extraocular muscles, which are rarely if ever affected in hypokalemic PP. In contrast to periodic paralysis, when profound weakness occurs in a myasthenic crisis, respiratory muscle involvement is common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic myopathies. Patients with a metabolic myopathy typically complain of exercise intolerance, with myalgias and muscle fatiguability, rather than attacks of weakness. Myoglobinuria may accompany or follow more severe symptoms (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-metabolic-myopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the metabolic myopathies&quot;</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary hypokalemia. Episodic weakness may be seen in association with severe hypokalemia due to renal, gastrointestinal, or other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/31-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-36</a>]. There is typically clinical or laboratory evidence of the underlying systemic disease, and hypokalemia persists between attacks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-hypokalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and treatment of hypokalemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypokalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>In a first attack of quadriparesis, other diagnoses such as Guillain Barr&eacute; syndrome, acute myelopathy (eg, transverse myelitis), myasthenic crisis, tick paralysis, and botulism may be considered initially. However, the finding of hypokalemia generally alerts the clinician to the diagnosis of hypokalemic PP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When there is an established family history of hypokalemic PP, episodes of periodic paralysis often require no further diagnostic evaluation. Otherwise, the diagnosis of hypokalemic PP is suggested by documentation of hypokalemia during a typical attack of weakness. Even when this is demonstrated, other testing is required to rule out alternative diagnoses.</p><p>When patients are evaluated after or between attacks, the diagnosis may be difficult. Further diagnostic options include genetic tests, provocative testing and electromyography.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During an acute attack, measurement of serum potassium is required, both for diagnosis and to guide treatment. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Acute treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Other testing is also required to rule out alternative diagnoses:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperthyroidism should be excluded with laboratory testing: T3, T4, and TSH levels. In the acute setting, findings of tachycardia and hypophosphatemia can raise suspicion of this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-and-graves-disease#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic manifestations of hyperthyroidism and Graves' disease&quot;, section on 'Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed to identify a prolonged QT or QU interval suggestive of Andersen syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77018\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef77018 \">waveform 2</a>).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-pathophysiology-of-renal-tubular-acidosis-and-the-effect-on-potassium-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and pathophysiology of renal tubular acidosis and the effect on potassium balance&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The value of these tests is illustrated in case series. Diagnostic evaluation in 34 patients with episodic weakness from Thailand determined that 11 had thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, 8 had distal RTA, and 15 had hypokalemic PP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Hypokalemic PP occurred without a known family history in two-thirds of cases. Among those with RTA, a metabolic acidosis was noted in only two patients. Only subtle clinical signs of hyperthyroidism were observed in 4 of 11 patients with hyperthyroidism. In a larger case series of 97 patients with an initial diagnosis of hypokalemic PP in the emergency department, 31 had hypokalemic PP, 39 had thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, and 24 had secondary hypokalemia (RTA, aldosteronism, Bartter syndrome, others) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Only two patients with hypokalemic PP had a family history in this series.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is possible to test for many but not all of the mutations that underlie hypokalemic PP. When genetic testing is negative, further testing with provocative testing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> electromyography may help establish the diagnosis of hypokalemic PP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Provocative testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Provocative testing can be employed, when genetic testing fails to identify an underlying mutation. Careful monitoring, usually in an inpatient setting, is recommended for all forms of provocative testing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Precipitating an attack of hypokalemic PP with an oral glucose load (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">gm/kg)</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> insulin administration (10 units subcutaneously) can be risky [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. This should be done in an inpatient setting with continuous cardiac monitoring and with availability of emergency resuscitative measures in case cardiac arrhythmias occur. Preexisting cardiac or renal disease precludes such testing and should be excluded prior to this test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise, such as 30 minutes of running on the treadmill, may provide a safer alternative to glucose or insulin administration. A positive response, weakness with accompanying hypokalemia, is more helpful than a negative response, because some patients do not have reliably-induced attacks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both hypokalemic PP and hyperkalemic PP can be induced with ACTH. In one study, in five patients with suspected hypokalemic PP, ACTH (80 to 100 IU IM) was administered in the evening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Muscle strength was assessed in the hand with a dynamometer at baseline and every one to two hours, along with measurement of serum potassium. Weakness was observed along with a fall in serum potassium to &lt;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> 13 to 27 hours after ACTH administration in four patients. Significant side effects did not occur, but hospitalization and careful monitoring is recommended for provocative testing.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Electromyography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During an attack, electromyography (EMG) may show decreased amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP), with reduced motor unit recruitment or electrical silence, depending on the severity of weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/11,41,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,41,43</a>]. Other findings more variably described include increased insertional activity, increased polyphasic motor unit potentials, and reduced muscle fiber conduction velocity.</p><p>An EMG technique that may be used to help confirm the diagnosis between attacks is the &quot;exercise test.&quot; CMAPs following a single supramaximal electrical stimulus are recorded at rest and every one to two minutes following two to five minutes of exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Exercise consists of maximal contraction of a muscle (biceps or anterior tibialis) for two to five minutes with three to four-second rest periods every 15 seconds. A gradual reduction of over 40 percent in the evoked motor amplitude after 30 to 40 minutes is compatible with a diagnosis of periodic paralysis but is not specific to hypokalemic PP. This test had a sensitivity of 71 percent in a case series of patients with periodic paralysis (either hypokalemic PP, hyperkalemic PP, or thyrotoxic PP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The sensitivity declines when attacks have not been recent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Other investigators have found that the test is also highly specific (97 to 98 percent) for muscle ion channel disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p>One report suggests that the EMG exercise test can discriminate between types of periodic paralysis. These investigators found that an initial increase in CMAP followed by a delayed decrease was seen in five of six patients with hyperkalemic PP after short-duration exercise (10 to 12 seconds) and only 1 of 13 patients with hypokalemic PP associated with a calcium channel defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Of the two patients with the sodium channel variant of hypokalemic PP, one had this finding.</p><p>The presence of myotonia on EMG strongly suggests the alternative diagnosis of hyperkalemic PP. This finding is seen in up to 80 percent of patients with hyperkalemic PP, in no patients with hypokalemic PP associated with the calcium channel defect, and rarely in patients with the sodium channel variant of hypokalemic PP or without an identified mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypokalemic-periodic-paralysis/abstract/10,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,48</a>].
