SCORTEN is based upon seven independent and easily measured clinical and laboratory variables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66897\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66897 \">table 1</a>) and has been validated for use on days one and three of hospitalization for <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stevens-johnson-syndrome-and-toxic-epidermal-necrolysis-management-prognosis-and-long-term-sequelae/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. </p><p>The SCORTEN score may be used to determine which clinical setting (intensive <span class=\"nowrap\">therapy/burn</span> unit or nonspecialized ward) is appropriate for the management of the individual patient, as described below. The survival curves based upon the SCORTEN score at admission (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58211\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58211 \">figure 1</a>) may be helpful when discussing a patient's prognosis with family members or medical staff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stevens-johnson-syndrome-and-toxic-epidermal-necrolysis-management-prognosis-and-long-term-sequelae/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, it should be noted that, due to progresses in the management of <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span> patients in specialized centers, including burn units, SCORTEN may overestimate the mortality risk in those settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stevens-johnson-syndrome-and-toxic-epidermal-necrolysis-management-prognosis-and-long-term-sequelae/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H150140050\"><span class=\"h2\">Referral to intensive therapy or burn unit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to refer the patient to an intensive care or burn unit should be made on a case-by-case basis, based upon the extent of skin involvement and the presence of comorbidities.

Patients with more severe disease (skin detachment &gt;30 percent of the body surface area) <strong>or</strong> a SCORTEN score &ge;2 should be transferred to intensive care units, burn units, or specialized dermatology units, if available.</p><p>Several studies indicate that prognosis is better for patients transferred promptly to a burn care unit or intensive care unit. In a retrospective multicenter review of 199 patients with TEN treated at burn care centers, the overall mortality was 32 percent compared with 51 percent among patients initially cared for in other settings and transferred to a burn center more than one week after disease onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stevens-johnson-syndrome-and-toxic-epidermal-necrolysis-management-prognosis-and-long-term-sequelae/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PROMPT WITHDRAWAL OF CULPRIT DRUG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with suspected SJS and TEN induced by medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91163\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91163 \">table 2</a>), early identification and withdrawal of the offending agent may improve the prognosis. In a 10-year observational study of 113 patients with TEN or SJS, early withdrawal of the causative drug reduced the risk of death by 30 percent for each day before the development of blisters and erosions (odds ratio [OR] 0.69; 95% CI 0.53-0.89) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stevens-johnson-syndrome-and-toxic-epidermal-necrolysis-management-prognosis-and-long-term-sequelae/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

The severity and prognosis of the disease should be rapidly determined by using the SCORTEN score to define the appropriate medical setting for management. (See <a href=\"#H150139875\" class=\"local\">'Rapid evaluation of severity and prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with extensive skin detachment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a SCORTEN score &ge;2, we suggest transfer to intensive therapy or burn unit if possible (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H150140050\" class=\"local\">'Referral to intensive therapy or burn unit'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early recognition and immediate withdrawal of any potentially causative agents are critical first steps in the management of <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span>. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prompt withdrawal of culprit drug'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment and includes wound care, fluid and electrolyte management, nutritional support, ocular care, temperature management, pain control, and monitoring or treatment of superinfections. (See <a href=\"#H1248919108\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal approach to wound care has not been determined. Success has been reported with both repeated debridement of exfoliating skin and &quot;antishear&quot; wound care, in which the necrotic skin is left in place to act as a biologic dressing. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Wound care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular lesions require immediate attention and care. Specific interventions aimed at preventing long-term ocular sequelae in severe cases with extensive sloughing of the bulbar conjunctiva include the use of preservative-free corticosteroid eye drops, coverage of the eye surface with cryopreserved amniotic membrane, and use of scleral spacers. (See <a href=\"#H2557652173\" class=\"local\">'Ocular management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because sepsis is the major cause of death, infection control measures, including sterile handling, topical antiseptic agents, and surveillance cultures of possible sites of superinfection, are important components of prevention. Prophylactic systemic antibiotics are <strong>not</strong> utilized by the majority of burn centers, although antimicrobials should be administered at the first sign of infection, and choice of agent should be guided by specific culture data. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Prevention and treatment of infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beyond supportive care, we suggest using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> 3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> as adjunctive therapy early in the course of the disease (ie, within 24 to 48 hours of symptom onset) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3644514009\" class=\"local\">'Cyclosporine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of systemic corticosteroids in the management of <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span> remains uncertain. Treatment modality (eg, oral versus intravenous &quot;pulse&quot; administration), dose, timing, and duration have not been determined. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Systemic corticosteroids'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <strong>not </strong>using intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) for <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In several meta-analyses, no clear survival advantage has been found for patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span> treated with IVIG. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous immune globulin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The overall mortality rate among patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">SJS/TEN</span> is approximately 25 percent, ranging from approximately 10 percent for SJS to more than 30 percent for TEN. Sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ failure are the most common causes of in-hospital death. Long-term sequelae involving the skin and eyes are common among survivors. (See <a href=\"#H596135\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Long-term sequelae'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3146834979\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We are saddened by the death of Milton H Nirken, MD, who passed away in August 2017.
