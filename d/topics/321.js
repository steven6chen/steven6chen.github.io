Patients with acute PVT have the sudden onset of portal venous occlusion due to thrombus. The occlusion may be complete or partial. In addition to involving the portal vein, the clot may also involve the mesenteric veins or the splenic vein. Patients with acute PVT have not yet developed features of chronic PVT, such as collateral circulation (eg, cavernous portal transformation) or portal hypertension. If it is not known when the clot developed, but the patient does not have features of chronic PVT, the PVT can be referred to as being &quot;recent&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Patients may also report fever and dyspeptic symptoms. Patients with cirrhosis may present with variceal bleeding. The presence of spiking fevers, chills, and a painful liver is suggestive of septic PVT (acute pylephlebitis). In addition to symptoms related to the PVT, patients may also have symptoms related to conditions that predispose to the development of PVT, such as acute pancreatitis.

Patients typically do not have guarding unless the PVT is the result of an intra-abdominal inflammatory process or if intestinal infarction has occurred.

Liver tests are typically normal because hepatic arterial blood flow compensates for decreased portal inflow, though a transient, moderate increase in serum aminotransferases is seen in some patients. In patients with bowel infarction, laboratory testing may reveal metabolic acidosis, signs of renal or respiratory failure, a leukocytosis, and an elevated hematocrit due to hemoconcentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In patients with septic PVT, blood cultures are often positive for <em>Bacteroides fragilis</em> or <em>Escherichia coli, </em>though other pathogens have also been cultured.

In patients with acute PVT, there will be evidence of portal venous occlusion without the radiographic signs that would suggest chronic PVT, such as cavernous portal transformation. Patients with acute PVT should also undergo an evaluation to identify conditions that may have predisposed to PVT formation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F73799\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73799 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>In patients with suspected acute PVT, we obtain a contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan. If the suspicion for portal vein thrombosis is not high, a Doppler ultrasound is a reasonable initial approach. If the ultrasound suggests acute PVT, an abdominal CT scan can then be obtained. In addition to confirming the diagnosis of acute PVT, CT can aid with the diagnosis of predisposing conditions (eg, intra-abdominal infection), assess the extent of the thrombosis, and detect evidence of intestinal infarction. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an alternative in patients who cannot undergo CT or in whom radiation exposure from CT is a concern. While abdominal ultrasonography with Doppler imaging may also suggest acute PVT, it is not sensitive for determining the extent of the thrombosis and may not detect predisposing conditions or ischemia. However, if CT and MRI are contraindicated or not available, Doppler ultrasound is an alternative. Finally, a diagnosis of PVT can be made with portal venography or superior mesenteric angiography, but angiography is invasive and is generally not required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H406033994\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal CT or MRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with acute PVT, a CT scan without contrast may show hyperattenuating material in the portal vein, though contrast-enhanced imaging is often needed to make the diagnosis because the density of the thrombus may be difficult to differentiate from the vessel wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Imaging after injecting intravenous contrast may reveal lack of luminal enhancement, increased hepatic enhancement in the arterial phase, and decreased hepatic enhancement in the portal phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. On MRI angiography, PVT appears as a filling defect that partially or completely occludes the vessel lumen in the portal venous phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The portal vein diameter is typically greater than 13 to 55 mm in diameter and does not vary in diameter during respiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Because a thrombus may not be visualized on ultrasound in up to a third of patients with PVT, Doppler imaging should also be used. In patients with PVT, Doppler imaging will show the absence of flow in some or all of the vessel lumen. Ultrasonography with Doppler imaging has been estimated to be 89 to 93 percent sensitive and 92 to 93 percent specific for diagnosing PVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12</a>]. The sensitivity of Doppler ultrasound depends in part on the expertise of the ultrasonographer and whether PVT was suspected prior to the examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The approach to the evaluation of patients with established venous thrombosis is discussed in detail elsewhere.

In cases of tumor invasion or external constriction, a thrombus within the portal vein may develop as a secondary event (malignant PVT). Imaging characteristics can help differentiate benign PVT from malignant PVT.

The goal of anticoagulation is to prevent extension of the clot and to allow for recanalization so that intestinal infarction and portal hypertension do not develop. Unlike chronic PVT, where the role of anticoagulation in patients with cirrhosis is unclear, studies suggest anticoagulation for acute PVT is beneficial for patients with cirrhosis. However, because patients with cirrhosis may have esophageal varices, we typically screen for varices prior to initiating anticoagulation. (See <a href=\"#H235138178\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of anticoagulation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H417348821\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic portal vein thrombosis in adults: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Anticoagulation'</a>.)</p><p>Patients should be started on low molecular weight heparin to achieve rapid anticoagulation, with a switch to an oral anticoagulant (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or possibly a direct-acting oral anticoagulant [DOAC]) once the patient's condition has stabilized and no invasive procedures are planned (if warfarin is used, our goal international normalized ratio [INR] is 2 to 3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>Several case reports indicate that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apixaban</a> may also be used to treat PVT successfully [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. However, for patients with cirrhosis, there are reports suggesting decreased efficacy of rivaroxaban and apixaban [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Importantly, there are no large series of subjects who have been treated with these agents for PVT; one small retrospective series suggested that the bleeding risks with these agents are comparable to those seen with traditional anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. More data are needed to make evidence-based recommendations on the use of these agents in patients with acute PVT, particularly for those with cirrhosis.</p><p>Treatment is generally recommended for at least three to six months, though long-term treatment is recommended for most patients with permanent thrombotic risk factors that cannot be corrected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Long-term therapy may also be appropriate for patients with acute PVT that extends into the mesenteric veins, given the risk of intestinal infarction in such patients. In patients with cirrhosis, non-warfarin-based therapy may be preferable since the INR may not reflect the patient's level of anticoagulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-and-other-vkas-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Warfarin and other VKAs: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=direct-oral-anticoagulants-and-parenteral-direct-thrombin-inhibitors-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Direct oral anticoagulants and parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemostatic-abnormalities-in-patients-with-liver-disease#H61498878\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with liver disease&quot;, section on 'Portal vein thrombosis (PVT)'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to anticoagulation, patients with septic PVT require antibiotic therapy. Patients who develop infarction in the setting of acute PVT require surgical exploration. Failure to do so is associated with high mortality rates.

Recanalization is important because failure to restore venous drainage of the small intestine puts patients at risk for intestinal ischemia and infarction, as well as complications from chronic PVT. In addition, the use of anticoagulation for acute PVT is indirectly supported by numerous trials that show a benefit of anticoagulation patients with deep vein thrombosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic portal vein thrombosis in adults: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Limited data suggest that patients diagnosed with acute PVT are unlikely to spontaneously recanalize their portal vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22,23</a>]. However, retrospective studies have found that if patients are treated with anticoagulation, at least partial recanalization of the portal vein occurs in 63 to 93 percent of patients, with complete recanalization in 34 to 45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22-25</a>]. As an example, in a series of 95 patients with acute PVT followed for a median of 234 days, anticoagulation restored patency of the portal vein in 39 percent of patients.

In patients who do not have an indication for life-long therapy, such as an underlying hypercoagulable state, it is not clear whether to continue anticoagulation beyond six months if complete recanalization has not occurred by that time.

In a systematic review that included 71 patients undergoing thrombolysis (with or without thrombectomy), recanalization of the protal vein was complete in 29 patients (41 percent), partial in 32 (45 percent), and absent in 10 (14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

It is typically reserved for patients who are undergoing surgery for intestinal infarction. In such patients, surgical thrombectomy can be carried out during the laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62356949\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If treatment for acute portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is initiated prior to the onset of intestinal infarction, the patient's prognosis is good [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1,34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,34-38</a>]. Abdominal pain and systemic inflammatory response syndrome will start to subside within hours to days after the initiation of anticoagulation and intestinal infarction is prevented if the superior mesenteric vein remains patent or recanalizes. In addition, portal hypertension is prevented if the portal trunk and at least one of its branches remains patent or is recanalized. In a prospective study of 105 patients with acute PVT, 44 percent achieved patency of portal venous flow, with a mortality rate of 2 percent at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Untreated, patients with acute PVT may develop intestinal infarction, though the frequency with which this occurs is unclear.

(See <a href=\"#H417351900\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute PVT may be clinically silent or patients may report symptoms such as abdominal pain that develops suddenly or progresses over a few days. Patients with cirrhosis may present with variceal bleeding. The presence of spiking fevers, chills, and a painful liver is suggestive of septic PVT (acute pylephlebitis). Intestinal infarction should be considered in patients who have abdominal pain that radiates to the back, persists beyond five to seven days, is associated with abdominal distension, or is associated with bloody diarrhea. (See <a href=\"#H57741437\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pylephlebitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pylephlebitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with suspected acute PVT, our approach is to obtain a Doppler ultrasound or contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan. In addition to confirming the diagnosis of acute PVT, CT can aid with the diagnosis of potential predisposing conditions (eg, intra-abdominal infection), assess the extent of the thrombosis, and detect evidence of intestinal infarction. (See <a href=\"#H57741474\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with PVT who do not have cirrhosis or who have compensated (Child A or B) cirrhosis should be evaluated for conditions that may have predisposed to the development of the clot, such as prothrombotic states. Because PVT is common in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, it is reasonable not to pursue an evaluation in such patients unless they also have a history of thrombotic episodes at another location or other clinical clues suggestive of a hypercoagulable state. (See <a href=\"#H406033910\" class=\"local\">'Identification of predisposing conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend anticoagulation therapy for patients with acute portal vein thrombosis rather than expectant management, provided that there is no excessive bleeding risk (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In addition, when possible, predisposing conditions should be treated. Patients should be started on low molecular weight heparin to achieve rapid anticoagulation, with a switch to an oral anticoagulant once the patient's condition has stabilized and no invasive procedures are planned (if <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> is used, our goal international normalized ratio [INR] is 2 to 3). In patients with cirrhosis, non-warfarin-based therapy may be preferable since the INR may not reflect the patient's level of anticoagulation. (See <a href=\"#H57741452\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with transient or correctable thrombotic risk factors (eg, pancreatitis) or in whom no thrombotic risk factor is identified, we suggest six months of anticoagulation rather than long-term anticoagulation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with permanent thrombotic risk factors that cannot be corrected, we suggest long-term anticoagulation rather than six months anticoagulation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In addition, long-term therapy may also be appropriate for patients with acute PVT that extends into the mesenteric veins, given the risk of intestinal infarction in such patients.
