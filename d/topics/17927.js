However, relapse may occur in 10 to 15 percent of patients with favorable prognosis early (stages I to II) HL and in 15 to 30 percent of patients with more advanced HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. Approximately 10 to 15 percent of patients have refractory disease that either does not respond to initial therapy or progresses after an initial partial response. </p><p>The goal of treatment of relapsed or refractory HL should be to achieve long-term disease control while limiting toxicity and complications of therapy. Salvage chemotherapy can achieve a complete response in more than half of patients with first relapse of HL or refractory disease, but long-term disease-free survival generally requires autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=determining-eligibility-for-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Determining eligibility for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment of <span class=\"nowrap\">relapsed/refractory</span> HL with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy will be reviewed here.

Progression or relapse are recognized as a 50 percent increase in the longest diameter of a previously identified lesion, appearance of a new site of disease, or <span class=\"nowrap\">new/recurrent</span> involvement of the bone marrow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97480\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97480 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Among patients with relapsed or refractory HL, approximately one-third each are classified as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapsed less than one year after initial CR </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapsed more than one year after initial CR</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Refractory disease </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9396345\"><span class=\"h1\">CONFIRMING REFRACTORY/RELAPSED DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to confirm the diagnosis of relapsed HL, and to determine if apparent residual or progressive disease indeed represents refractory HL. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9396352\"><span class=\"h2\">Detection of relapsed or refractory disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient treated for HL should be monitored for disease response during treatment, assessed for maintenance of remission following completion of therapy, and evaluated for complications of treatment. The nature and frequency of such evaluations are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monitoring-of-the-patient-with-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-during-and-after-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monitoring of the patient with classical Hodgkin lymphoma during and after treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most recurrences of HL present with symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a mass lesion detected on physical examination. As an example, one study of 210 patients observed that 30 of 37 (81 percent) relapsing patients were symptomatic; in only four cases was relapse detected as a result of routine physical examination of an asymptomatic patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>It is important to distinguish complete response from partial response in patients with residual radiographic abnormalities after initial treatment of HL, in order to distinguish fibrosis from persistent (ie, refractory) HL and thereby avoid unnecessary therapy. This may include positron emission <span class=\"nowrap\">tomography/computed</span> tomographic <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET/CT)</span> scanning to distinguish residual <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrosis/necrosis</span> from persistent disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biopsy of the suspicious mass. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9396380\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis of relapsed HL generally requires biopsy of a suspicious mass. Clinical judgment often determines whether or not a biopsy is required, but it is sound practice to obtain a tissue diagnosis in most patients. This is especially true in the setting of late relapse, since there is a significant risk for second cancers (non-Hodgkin lymphoma or solid tumors) in these patients. In an instructive report, four patients with HL and PET-avid nodal enlargement at 8 to 48 months post-treatment were found to have benign sarcoid-like lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second malignancies after treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A repeat biopsy may not be necessary in patients with early recurrence in the setting of incomplete remission, especially with persistence of constitutional symptoms. However, if the disease was unusually resistant to therapy, a biopsy may be warranted to confirm the initial diagnosis of HL and exclude other diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9396387\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Restaging is recommended at the time of relapse, especially if there appears to be an isolated relapse. Restaging is important for assessing prognosis and for guiding treatment, including selection and duration of chemotherapy, use of radiation therapy, and decisions relating to hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunotherapy.</p><p>Various restaging schemes have been proposed for relapsed HL, but the most straightforward approach employs the criteria of the Ann Arbor staging system with Cotswolds modification to describe the extent of disease at the time of relapse and substitutes the letters RS (relapse stage) for CS (clinical stage) or PS (pathological stage) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66651\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66651 \">table 2</a>).

Actuarial four-year overall survival for patients relapsing after chemotherapy was 83, 66, 36, and 27 percent for those with zero, one, two, or three unfavorable factors, respectively. Subsequent studies by the GHSG confirmed the adverse prognostic value of these risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p>The likelihood of achieving a complete response and a sustained remission diminishes with second and subsequent relapses. </p><p>Outcomes following treatment for refractory HL are even less favorable than following relapse. As an example, an Italian study found that only 8 percent of patients with refractory HL were alive at eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, among patients who are able to undergo autologous HCT, long-term survival can approach 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1504932976\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of treatment of relapsed or refractory HL should be to achieve long-term disease control (ie, cure) while limiting toxicity and complications of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].
