Despite a comprehensive examination, however, a minority of parents will still be left without a definitive reason for their child's demise.</p><p>Procedures for evaluation of the stillborn will be reviewed here. The incidence, etiology, prevention, and management of antepartum fetal death and counseling parents after stillbirth are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-death-and-stillbirth-incidence-etiology-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal death and stillbirth: Incidence, etiology, and prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-death-and-stillbirth-maternal-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal death and stillbirth: Maternal care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MATERNAL LABORATORY EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal laboratory evaluation of women who have had a stillbirth is controversial. Many lists have been proposed, but the most cost-effective approach has not been determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/1-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-10</a>]. Our approach is guided by clinical, sonographic, and histopathologic findings.</p><p>The author orders or reviews recent tests results for:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetomaternal hemorrhage (eg, Kleihauer-Betke test, flow cytometry) in all women who have an unexplained stillbirth since detection of a large fetomaternal hemorrhage may explain the cause of an otherwise unexplained fetal demise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-fetomaternal-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive fetomaternal hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine toxicology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count (CBC). An abnormal CBC may prompt evaluation for an inherited hemoglobinopathy or other maternal disorder as the cause of fetal death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serological testing for syphilis in women with a history of sexually transmitted infections and those who live in areas of high prevalence, or if this test has not been performed earlier in pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fasting glucose concentration or glycated hemoglobin level, which can be useful for excluding poor glycemic control as a cause of stillbirth in women who have not been evaluated for gestational diabetes and in those known to have diabetes mellitus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood antibody screen to exclude red cell alloimmunization.</p><p/><p>Thyroid function tests, lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibody titers, liver function tests, fibrinogen concentration, and thrombophilia evaluation are obtained in selected patients in whom there is a clinical suspicion of a specific underlying disorder, and rarely to further evaluate unexplained stillbirths (stillborns with no gross or microscopic abnormalities). However, testing for inherited thrombophilias because of stillbirth is controversial, and UpToDate suggests limiting testing to cases with evidence of substantial maternal vascular malperfusion in the placental examination (decidual arteriopathy or vascular thrombi with placental infarction), but these cases are rare. If performed, testing should be performed at least three months postpartum to exclude normal pregnancy-related effects on coagulation parameters. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy#H7898324\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited thrombophilias in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Selection of patients for testing'</a>.)</p><p>Routine serologic testing for infection is unlikely to be useful because many women have positive serologies from prior infections, which are unrelated to the stillbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Cytomegalovirus titer (IgM, acute and convalescent IgG), toxoplasmosis titer (IgM, acute and convalescent IgG), parvovirus B19 titer (IgM), and a<em> Listeria </em>culture are obtained if indicated by maternal clinical, prenatal sonographic, or histopathologic findings. (Refer to individual topic reviews on these infections.)</p><p>Culture of the fetal skin or placenta surface may be misleading because of contamination during delivery; culture of internal fetal organs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the area between the amnion and chorion is more reliable. (See <a href=\"#H1593049628\" class=\"local\">'Routine placental and noninvasive fetal evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF THE AUTOPSY AND PLACENTAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although discussing autopsy may be uncomfortable for some patients and caregivers, it is an important diagnostic procedure and requires written consent. Some insurance companies cover all or part of the cost.&nbsp;Many will cover the cost of maternal and placental tests, but not tests on the stillborn.&nbsp;The health facility absorbs the cost of tests ordered in these situations. Histopathologic analysis of a fetus less than the legal gestational age of abortion (fetopsy) is billed like other surgical specimens. Molecular testing and cytogenetics are often not covered by insurance. These special tests often require consent by the family, with attestation of such by the clinician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical value</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete clinical evaluation plus conventional autopsy with placental pathologic examination can diagnose the cause of death in the majority of cases. Determining the cause of death is important because sooner or later parents will want to know &quot;Why did this happen?&quot; and &quot;Will it happen again?&quot; Answers to these questions are often impossible without information gained from pathologic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>], as some diagnoses are only made by autopsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56722\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56722 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>The likelihood of finding an explanatory diagnosis depends on the completeness of the examination, the experience of the pathologist, and the gestational age at delivery. The frequency of unexplained stillbirth at term is less than 30 to 40 percent of cases receiving optimal evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. Findings at perinatal autopsy can change the clinical diagnosis of the cause of fetal death or yield additional findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This new information often influences management of future pregnancies. As an example, a study including 1477 stillbirths reported that autopsy findings identified the cause of death in 46 percent of cases and yielded new information in 51 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This new information changed the estimated recurrence risk in 40 percent of cases, and changed recommendations for preconceptional care in 9 percent, prenatal diagnostic procedures in 21 percent, prenatal management in 7 percent, and neonatal management in 3 percent.</p><p>Unexplained cases can also provide useful information to the clinician and family, as anomalies and many diseases can be excluded as a cause of death. Unexplained causes of death in the third trimester may be a form of sudden infant death syndrome in utero.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of the pathologist</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compassionate parental counseling is important to obtain informed consent before the pathologic examination and when communicating the findings. The practitioner seeking to obtain consent should be familiar with the procedure and have a simple but clear explanation of it for discussion with the family.</p><p>A full autopsy without restrictions and including placental pathologic examination is optimal for determining the cause of death, but restrictions on the procedure can be instituted upon the family's request. These can include, for example, consent for visual external examination or postmortem imaging studies only, restrictions to specific <span class=\"nowrap\">organs/regions,</span> and restrictions about the disposition of the <span class=\"nowrap\">organs/tissues</span> (eg, whether to return to body or retain for complete examination).</p><p>Ideally, the autopsy should be performed by an experienced perinatal pathologist. If a perinatal pathologist is not available at the hospital where the stillbirth occurred, the body can be transferred to at a medical center with appropriate personnel and facilities or fetal and placental specimens can be sent for evaluation. If questions still persist or if the pathologist wishes, an expert perinatal pathologist can be consulted and sent all of the histologic slides and other materials (eg, photographs, radiographs) developed for the case.</p><p>Good documentation and careful dissection is essential. Photographs of any malformations or suspected malformations (especially when discrepancies between antenatal diagnoses and autopsy findings occur), results of laboratory and imaging studies, unusual findings, and pertinent negative findings are extremely important.</p><p>The autopsy should be completed in a timely way, as the family's concerns and grieving period increase with delays. Autopsy reports should also be completed promptly so it is available for the family's meeting with the clinicians. Including the pathologist in these meetings is very helpful for explaining the autopsy report and answering questions (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Report of findings'</a> below). The pathologist is often thought of as an impartial specialist since <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> was not involved in the patient's antepartum or intrapartum management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPONENTS OF THE PERINATAL AUTOPSY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Autopsy Committee of the College of American Pathologists, with representatives of other interested organizations, prepared a guideline to assist pathologists in reporting perinatal autopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The judgment of the pathologist performing a specific case should guide the evaluation since there is no high-quality evidence establishing the optimum combination of tests that should be performed routinely on all stillbirths.</p><p>One study evaluating a protocol for postmortem examination of stillbirths concluded that gross examination, photography, radiography, and bacterial cultures should be performed in all cases, while karyotyping and microscopy could be reserved for stillborns that are abnormal on gross examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This approach was less costly than performing these studies routinely, but still provided adequate information for genetic counseling since the prevalence of karyotype abnormalities is low (&lt;2 percent) in the absence of dysmorphic features, growth abnormalities, structural anomalies, or hydrops after careful postmortem examination. However, this protocol might fail to detect some chromosomal abnormalities and some nongenetic disorders, such as viral infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-placental-pathology-report\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The placental pathology report&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cytogenetic abnormalities&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The author's approach is described in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1593049628\"><span class=\"h2\">Routine placental and noninvasive fetal evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most parents will consent to the following common components of stillborn evaluation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review of the complete medical record to obtain the clinical history, with attention to medical, obstetric (past and present), and genetic conditions potentially associated with stillbirth. Informational gaps can be filled by the patient or her clinician. The author also reviews all previous obstetric and gynecologic specimens sent for pathologic examination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-death-and-stillbirth-incidence-etiology-and-prevention#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal death and stillbirth: Incidence, etiology, and prevention&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-death-and-stillbirth-incidence-etiology-and-prevention#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal death and stillbirth: Incidence, etiology, and prevention&quot;, section on 'Predicting pregnancies at risk'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of birth weight and fetal biometrics.

Detailed photographs of the entire fetus from several views (anterior, posterior, and lateral) and a facial photograph provide good documentation for future reference. Photographs of normal findings and pertinent negative findings can also be useful. As an example, a directed photograph of the fingers with nails can exclude many syndromes if the nail formation is normal. The facial photograph may be given to the parents, if requested.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gross and microscopic examination of the placenta. A sample of a placental worksheet is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52233\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52233 \">table 1</a>). Sections of placental tissues are processed for histological examination in all cases, even when severely autolyzed or structurally normal. Some pathologic findings can still be diagnosed in severely autolyzed tissues (eg, viral infections and tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53795\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53795 \">picture 2</a>)). Placental findings are often the most informative source for determining the etiology of the stillbirth as placental insufficiency and infection are the most common causative findings. A detailed discussion of placental findings is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gross-examination-of-the-placenta\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gross examination of the placenta&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-placental-pathology-report#H1173795429\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The placental pathology report&quot;, section on 'Placental findings'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a 2014 systematic review investigating the likelihood of diagnosing a cause of stillbirth from placental examination, histopathological examination provided useful information about the cause of death or contributing factors in 11 to 84 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The wide range was attributed to variations in study methodology, completeness of placental investigation, classification systems, and clinical significance attributed to placental findings. The authors concluded that the precise role of various placental lesions in stillbirth remains uncertain. Determination of causality in an individual case is difficult because even though certain placental abnormalities are more common in stillbirths and complicated pregnancies, the same lesions can be seen in placentas from clinically normal pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A population-based study that used a standardized placental pathology protocol noted that all lesions found in the placentas of stillborns were also found in the placentas of liveborns, but lesion prevalence differed between the two groups and also by gestational age at delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Major findings included:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Acute chorioamnionitis and funisitis were common findings in both stillbirths and livebirths before 24 weeks of gestation, and more common in livebirths (chorioamnionitis of the chorionic plate: 36 versus 82 percent; funisitis: 22 versus 43 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Retroplacental hematoma was most common before 24 weeks, and occurred with similar frequency in stillbirths and livebirths (36 percent in both stillbirths and livebirths).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Fetal vascular thrombosis became more common with advancing gestational age at delivery, and was more common in stillbirths than livebirths after 24 weeks (at 24 to 31 weeks: 22 versus 11 percent; at 32 to 36 weeks: 26 versus 12 percent; at term: 35 versus 6 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Although an infrequent finding, diffuse placental infarction was far more common in stillbirths than livebirths. The overall prevalence in stillbirths and livebirths across gestation was 2.8 and 0.1 percent, respectively (odds ratio 43, 95% CI 5.6-328).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gross and microscopic examination of the umbilical cord, including measurement of the true complete cord length and number of vessels. A short cord can be a sign of neuromuscular compromise; a long cord can be a sign of heart failure or that a cord accident may have played a pivotal role in the demise, while a single umbilical artery can be associated with genitourinary anomalies (eg, renal agenesis, horseshoe kidney). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-placental-pathology-report#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The placental pathology report&quot;, section on 'Umbilical cord'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A cord coil is a 360-degree spiral course of umbilical vessels. Cord coiling should be noted and reported as either the number of coils in 10 cm (2 is normal, &lt;2 is hypocoiled, &gt;2 is hypercoiled) or the cord coiling index (number of coils in the entire length of the cord divided by the length in cm; &lt;0.07 is hypocoiled and &gt;0.3 is hypercoiled). Although most studies have reported that hyper- or hypocoiled umbilical cords are associated with increased perinatal mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>] and congenital anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], this has not been universally found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacterial cultures should be performed on the placenta, especially if autopsy permission is declined. The placenta, although contaminated by the birthing procedures and handling after delivery, can be cultured by peeling the amnion off of the chorion and swabbing this newly exposed chorionic surface or taking a small portion of the chorion using sterile technique. Both aerobic and anaerobic cultures should be performed. Pathogens responsible for the fetal death (eg, group B <em>streptococcus</em>) may be determined using these techniques; contamination has rarely been a problem. The author does not believe routine specialized cultures for viruses or <em><span class=\"nowrap\">Mycoplasma/Ureaplasma</em></span> are necessary or cost-effective. (See <a href=\"#H3455959018\" class=\"local\">'Studies in selected cases'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Microbiologic studies can also be performed on fetal blood taken from the heart or umbilical cord, if a full autopsy is not performed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3703881889\"><span class=\"h2\">Invasive fetal evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detailed autopsy procedure is described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57160\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57160 \">table 2</a>). Autopsy protocols are adapted according to available resources in resource-limited settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In any setting, it is helpful to consider broad categories of stillbirth (small for gestational age, anomalous fetus, intrapartum demise of term normally grown fetus) and direct the autopsy according to the differential diagnosis of the category [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>].</p><p>Fetal autopsies should be performed with the care and respect that all autopsies are given. Also, it is not uncommon for a family to decide to view the body after the postmortem examination has been done; therefore, minimizing disfigurement during dissection is important. In the author's experience, even the smallest, youngest (in gestational age), and most autolyzed cases can receive a thorough post-mortem examination and be returned in a condition suitable for viewing.</p><p>Performance of the fetal autopsy is nearly identical to that of the adult or pediatric autopsy, but the focus on the dissection is modified. Since one major goal is to detect <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> verify congenital malformations and diseases, it is important to perform the dissection with careful attention to detail, despite the fetus' size and level of autolysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57160\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57160 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2984176579\"><span class=\"h3\">Weights and biometric measurements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following measurements are obtained:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Placental weight (trimmed of cord and membranes)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight of internal organs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crown-to-rump length (crown to ischial tuberosities, &quot;sitting height&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crown-to-heel length (crown to heel of extended leg)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foot length</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hand length</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head circumference (ie, occipitofrontal circumference &ndash; above ears, as if wearing glasses)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest circumference (around nipples)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal circumference (at umbilical insertion)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inner canthal distance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outer canthal distance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measurement of potentially anomalous structures (eg, finger, lip, ear)</p><p/><p>The weight, crown-to-rump length, foot length, and heart weight are compared with the range of values for gestational age in published tables, and a combination of these parameters are used to make a best estimate gestational age. This estimate is compared with the clinical estimate of gestational age using menstrual data, ultrasound examination, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physical examination. This helps to diagnose the small or large for gestational age fetus. However, demised fetuses lose weight between the time of demise, delivery, and autopsy, potentially resulting in overdiagnosis of growth restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Visceral organs, such as the liver, are more subject to post-demise weight loss than the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>A good 0 to 500 g (in at least 1 gram increments) tabletop scale and a hanging 100 to 5000 g scale (in 10 gram increments) are essential. For very small fetuses (&lt;20 weeks gestational age), often an analytical balance is needed for organ weights. Paired organs are weighed together. Many good standards for weights and measurements are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-42</a>] and should be posted at the bench where the autopsy is performed for quick consultation. If a weight significantly deviates from the norm, additional tests or sampling may be indicated. Brain weight is often facilitated by weighing a vessel of fixative, then allowing the brain to &quot;slip&quot; into the fixative while dissecting, then reweighing the vessel (with brain and fixative) and subtracting out the first weight. The author does not open the gastrointestinal tract (you need to preserve the contents), or inflate the lungs (retain the in utero lung contents).</p><p>Dissection of the fetal heart for weighing can be difficult, especially in autolyzed cases; fixing the heart-lung block can be helpful. Dissection of the fetal heart starts with a good in situ examination looking at situs, pulmonary venous return, persistence of the left superior vena cava, and caliber of the aortic arch and the brachiocephalic vein. Any anomalies in these structures should warrant careful dissection, and consideration of consultation with a cardiac surgeon or a pathologist with expertise; such consultation should be performed before continuing the dissection. Removing the heart and great vessels from the lungs and dissection along lines of flow (being careful to cut away from the septa), observation of normal fetal structures (patent and competent foramen ovale, patent ductus arteriosus), and documentation of all valves should be completed before the great vessels are removed and the heart weighed. If possible, photographic documentation of findings and pertinent negatives should be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2369245444\"><span class=\"h3\">Tissue sampling and culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The author always obtains samples of all tissues for microscopy. Although one study suggested that histopathology had limited utility in determining cause of death when the internal organs appeared normal macroscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], histopathology can detect contributing factors that are clinically important but not direct causes of death. For example, aspiration pneumonia and myocardial disease are not associated with gross abnormalities but can contribute to fetal demise.</p><p>Fetal cultures are best obtained from the fetal lung. After the chest wall is opened and before any evaluation of the contents is performed or organs handled, a sterile suture removal kit or equivalent sterile instruments are used to lift the right lower lobe of the lung and snip off a small portion (5 mm<sup>3</sup> is sufficient). The tissue sample is placed in a sterile jar or in sterile medium for transport to the microbiology lab. Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures are obtained in all cases; other studies for infection are obtained if indicated based on the clinical information and autopsy findings, or if requested. Postmortem bacterial overgrowth in fetal organs should not be a problem as the fetus is sterile unless infected in utero.</p><p>In addition, tissue may be frozen (at -80&deg; Celsius) for future examination and laboratory studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52278\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52278 \">table 3</a>).

The author follows a decision tree to decide if she will obtain tissue for karyotype or tissues for other special studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70214%7EOBGYN%2F63874\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70214 graphicRef63874 \">table 4A-B</a>). The author routinely takes tissue for microarray if cytogenetics is requested. The microarray is &quot;held for karyotype&quot; and is therefore available if needed in the future. Skin or skeletal muscle for karyotype and microarray are preferable. In autolyzed cases, umbilical cord <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chorionic plate may be substituted.</p><p>As discussed above, the author obtains aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures of the placenta and fetal lung (when available) in all cases (see <a href=\"#H1593049628\" class=\"local\">'Routine placental and noninvasive fetal evaluation'</a> above). In her opinion, viral cultures are rarely indicated, as the histopathology of the placenta and fetal organs is diagnostic of viral infection in most cases (eg, cytomegalovirus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50209\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50209 \">picture 3</a>), parvovirus, herpes simplex virus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66038%7EOBGYN%2F77699\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66038 graphicRef77699 \">picture 4A-B</a>)). Coxsackie virus can be passed across the placenta and should be suspected if myocarditis is found on histopathology; molecular studies can confirm this infection. Hydrops fetalis increases the likelihood of various bacterial and nonbacterial infections; appropriate studies are obtained based on the clinical scenario and other histologic findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis#H937253350\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonimmune hydrops fetalis&quot;, section on 'Infection'</a>.)</p><p>Ideally, metabolic studies are obtained on all stillbirths, but such studies are costly. When obtained in selected patients at high risk of a metabolic abnormality, analysis of blood spots is feasible even on markedly autolyzed specimens. A Guthrie card for this purpose is usually available in the newborn nursery. It should be labeled that the specimen is from a stillbirth. It is difficult to find a laboratory willing to do these tests on stillbirths, and each institution should identify a laboratory able to do this important test.</p><p>Radiographs may reveal unrecognized skeletal malformations or further evaluate suspected skeletal abnormalities. The author recommends radiographs only for anomalous fetuses as the yield in a non-anomalous fetus is low. Plain whole body anteroposterior and lateral radiographs are taken with the infant's head &quot;straight&quot; (use cellophane tape to hold the head straight, nose in line with umbilicus, arms and legs in anatomic position) and the extremities extended (the legs are placed as if jogging, with one leg flexed above the other and with extended arms slightly separated).

MRI may be superior to the autopsy for some neurologic diagnoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]; the author recommends a postmortem MRI in cases of antenatally diagnosed or suspected neurologic malformations, even in cases of marked autolysis. MRI shows soft tissue well but not bone, whereas computed tomography shows bone well but is less good for imaging soft tissue. Ultrasound examination is less useful. MRI or computed tomography studies may be acceptable to parents who refuse conventional autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2510088562\" class=\"local\">'Minimally invasive autopsy as an alternative to standard autopsy'</a> below.)</p><p>Other special studies may be indicated in selected cases based on the clinical scenario and can be performed at evisceration. For example, tissue for biochemistry can be obtained to evaluate for storage disorders or for directed molecular studies (eg, Noonan's panel). Skin or skeletal muscle samples are best for molecular studies; liver, blood, or bile is preferred for biochemical analysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Tests for genetic analysis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization</strong> <strong>(aCGH)</strong> &ndash; Chromosomal microarray is more likely than G-banded karyotype analysis to provide a genetic diagnosis.

However, the test is costly and the hospital may not cover the costs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-chromosomal-microarray-in-obstetrics#H12423093\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of chromosomal microarray in obstetrics&quot;, section on 'Fetal demise'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The advantages of microarray for genetic abnormalities in stillborns were illustrated in a study of 532 stillbirths in which both karyotype and microarray testing were attempted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Compared with traditional karyotype, microarray analysis was significantly more likely to:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Yield a result (87.4 versus 70.5 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Detect genomic abnormalities, ie, aneuploidy plus pathogenic variants (8.3 versus 5.8 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Detect genomic abnormalities in both subgroups of patients studied: antepartum fetal demise (8.8 versus 6.5 percent), stillborn with structural anomalies (29.9 versus 19.4 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Importantly, of the 157 stillbirths for which karyotype failed to provide a result, microarray yielded a definitive result in 125 cases (79.6 percent), and this result was abnormal in 9 cases (5.7 percent; aneuploidy 7 cases, pathogenic variant 2 cases). Conversely, microarray identified aneuploidy or a pathogenic variant in 44 stillbirths, of which 18 had a normal or failed karyotype.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The utility and clinical importance of microarray technology in the routine evaluation of stillbirth as part of the autopsy protocol is controversial. At the Massachusetts General Hospital, we have instituted this test as part of our routine autopsy protocol. We obtain the tissue for both karyotype and microarray on all perinatal autopsies but only run the tests with <span class=\"nowrap\">clinician/patient</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">attestation/consent</span>. We especially recommend microarray in cases when anatomic findings or history of multiple perinatal losses suggest a genetic cause of death (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63883\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63883 \">picture 5</a>). While microarray has many benefits, issues to consider are cost <span class=\"nowrap\">(karyotype/fluorescence</span> in situ hybridization [FISH] is less costly than microarray), logistics (both parents should have blood samples drawn when arrays are ordered), and uncertainty due to variants of unknown significance. The rate of variants of unknown significance can be decreased by comparison to the parental studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Conventional karyotype</strong> &ndash; Conventional G-band cytogenetic studies can be performed on the stillborn's blood or tissue as long as the cells are viable. Conventional G-band cytogenetic studies are a less costly alternative to microarray. Amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling performed upon diagnosis of fetal demise appears to yield a higher rate of viable cells for successful culture and G-banded karyotyping than studies performed on the stillborn after delivery (success rate: 80 to 100 percent from amniotic fluid obtained before delivery versus 10 to 30 percent from skin or umbilical cord blood after delivery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>DNA analysis</strong> &ndash; Case reports have described the utility of whole genome or exome sequencing and targeted gene panels to identify a monogenic cause for stillbirth or lethal anomalies when microarray analysis is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/52-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-56</a>]. The role of DNA analysis in unexplained stillbirth or determining the recurrence risk of lethal anomalies remains investigational. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1362397294\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure for sample collection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood can be collected from the umbilical cord; at least 3 mL should be placed in a heparinized tube. Skin samples are obtained by washing the skin with alcohol or sterile saline, drying the area with sterile gauze, and removing one square centimeter of tissue with underlying dermis. A specimen of adequate size and depth is important for successful culture. Fascia samples are usually taken from the Achilles tendon or thigh, using sterile technique. Fresh tissue samples should be placed in sterile medium (eg, Hanks <a href=\"topic.htm?path=balanced-salt-solution-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">balanced salt solution</a>) from the cytogenetics laboratory, or sterile saline solution, and kept at room temperature (do not use fixatives such as formaldehyde). DNA can be extracted from a blood sample on a Guthrie card.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In cases of moderate or marked autolysis (retention of a stillbirth), two separate samples are collected for cytogenetic analysis: one from fetal skin and the other from umbilical cord or chorionic plate. If culture fails and, therefore, karyotype analysis cannot be performed, directed FISH studies (eg, for trisomy 13, 18, or 21) might be successful on paraffin embedded blocks of fetal or placental tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], or microarray can be performed. A limitation of using placental tissue for karyotype is the potential for confounding from confined placental mosaicism.

An alternative &quot;minimally invasive autopsy&quot; procedure has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-61</a>], which may be more acceptable to some parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. These procedures usually involve a combination of advanced imaging (MRI <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> computed tomography) and tissue biopsy. The biopsies may be directed by imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>] or laparoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>] or be &quot;blind&quot; and directed by anatomical landmarks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

In one study of minimally invasive autopsy (MRI with other ancillary postmortem investigations), cause of death or major pathological lesion detected by minimally invasive autopsy was concordant with conventional autopsy in 175 of 185 fetuses at &le;24 weeks of gestation (94.6 percent) and 88 of 92 fetuses at &ge;24 weeks of gestation (95.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-stillbirth/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Postmortem MRI was most accurate for detection of renal, neural, and cardiac abnormalities (with the exception of ischemic brain injury and myocarditis), while abdominal findings were nonspecific and lung imaging was inaccurate for diagnosis of most pulmonary abnormalities, except major structural lesions.</p><p>The minimally invasive autopsy technique is rapidly evolving and may represent a socially acceptable alternative to the conventional autopsy in certain situations. The author prefers the conventional autopsy as it still represents the gold standard for determining cause of death and for confirmation of antenatally diagnosed malformations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3181999278\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERPRETATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3051791911\"><span class=\"h2\">Estimating time of death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, fetal death is not witnessed on ultrasound examination or by fetal heart monitoring, so the exact time of death is not known.

Much of this unknown category lies in the interpretation of findings and whether a finding may be considered the cause of death. For example, the author does not believe that fetal growth restriction alone is a cause of death (one needs to determine the etiology of the intrauterine growth restriction), but large studies often include this finding as an explained cause of death.</p><p>When a specific cause of death is not identified, information about the timing of insult and pertinent negatives and positives identified at postmortem examination can still be helpful. The author believes that a constellation of factors may lead to fetal demise in many of these cases.

A relatively minor finding at autopsy, not lethal by itself or in a less vulnerable fetus, may be related to the demise of the vulnerable fetus, especially when multiple such findings are observed.
