The terminology was changed from primary biliary cirrhosis to primary biliary cholangitis to more accurately describe the disorder and its natural history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The prognosis of patients with PBC has improved greatly during the past two decades because of its diagnosis at earlier stages and the widespread use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a> as treatment. As a result, far fewer patients require liver transplantation, and patients with stages I and II PBC appear to have a normal life expectancy.

Steatorrhea in PBC is due primarily to the decreased biliary secretion of bile acids so that their concentration within the small intestinal lumen is below the critical micellar concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Patients with concomitant sicca syndrome may also have pancreatic insufficiency, although this is a less common cause of malabsorption in PBC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. There are no reliable clinical findings that distinguish between these two causes of malabsorption.</p><p>Symptomatic steatorrhea due to bile acid insufficiency can be partially corrected by restricting dietary fat. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) can be added if caloric supplementation is required to maintain body weight. The digestion and absorption of MCTs are not nearly as dependent upon bile acids as are the long-chain fatty acids, which are the major constituent of dietary triglycerides. Each milliliter of MCT oil contains 7.5 calories. Most patients can tolerate 60 mL per day without difficulty. MCT oil can be taken directly by the teaspoon or can be used as salad oil or as a substitute for shortening in cooking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of malabsorption&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If pancreatic insufficiency is suspected, it is easier to empirically treat with pancreatic enzyme replacement than it is to diagnose. Preparations, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pancrelipase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pancrelipase</a>, taken with meals are usually effective.</p><p>A guideline issued by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases suggests providing 1000 to 1500 mg of calcium and 1000 international units of vitamin D daily through the diet and, if needed, supplements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with PBC may have malabsorption of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Deficiencies of vitamin E are uncommon except in patients with advanced disease awaiting liver transplantation. In comparison, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> deficiency occurs in approximately 30 percent of patients but is rarely symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. It correlates directly with serum retinol binding protein and albumin levels and inversely with serum bilirubin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Vitamin A deficiency usually responds to dietary supplements of vitamin A, 15,000 units per day (three times the recommended daily allowance). In exceptional cases, as in the patient with night blindness, parenteral vitamin A may be required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of malabsorption&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Vitamin D deficiency, if untreated, can lead to osteomalacia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-low-bone-mass-in-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of low bone mass in primary biliary cholangitis (primary biliary cirrhosis)&quot;</a>). It is best detected by measuring the serum concentration of calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D), the metabolite of vitamin D produced in the liver. Serum levels of calcidiol and calcitriol (the most active form of vitamin D) are usually normal in PBC except for patients who are deeply jaundiced and who are candidates for liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>An annual measurement of serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a> and calcidiol levels is sufficient in patients whose serum bilirubin concentration is elevated. Less frequent measurements (eg, every two to three years) are sufficient in patients with normal serum bilirubin levels. Measurements should be obtained more frequently in patients whose values are just above the lower limit of normal.</p><p>Clinically important vitamin K deficiency rarely occurs in PBC unless the patient regularly takes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholestyramine-resin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cholestyramine</a> and is deeply jaundiced. The prothrombin time is normal in most patients until late in the course of the disease when there are signs of liver failure. Only these patients require vitamin K supplementation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypothyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 20 percent of patients with PBC have or will develop hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It may predate the onset of primary biliary cholangitis or occur during its course. The thyroid injury is also due to autoimmune disease. In one study of patients with PBC, for example, the prevalence of antithyroglobulin and antimicrosomal antibodies was 20 and 34 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders that cause hypothyroidism&quot;, section on 'Chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis'</a>.)</p><p>The most accurate test to diagnose primary hypothyroidism is an elevation in the serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration. Serum thyroid hormone-binding proteins are increased in PBC; as a result, total but not free serum T4 levels may be normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Hypothyroidism is treated with thyroid hormone replacement in a dose that keeps TSH levels in the normal range. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-hypothyroidism-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of and screening for hypothyroidism in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-hypothyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary hypothyroidism in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Xanthomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fewer than 5 percent of patients with PBC develop xanthomas, which are deposits of cholesterol in the skin. Xanthelasmas (cholesterol-filled, soft, yellow plaques that usually appear on the medial aspects of the eyelids bilaterally) are more common and may occasionally be striking in appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67919\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67919 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tuberous xanthomas typically occur over extensor surfaces such as the knee and elbow, do not cause symptoms, and do not require treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75143\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75143 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Planar xanthomas may occur on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet and are often painful. These xanthomas can limit manual dexterity, and those on the soles make it painful to walk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57793\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57793 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p/><p>These lesions develop in patients whose serum cholesterol has been greater than 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> (15.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> for more than three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This degree of hypercholesterolemia is uncommon in PBC, and in our experience, symptomatic xanthomas occur only in deeply jaundiced patients who are candidates for liver transplantation.</p><p>Because planar xanthomas greatly diminish quality of life, they are usually treated. Treatment consists of large-volume plasmaphereses performed at one- to two-week intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Each plasmapheresis decreases the serum cholesterol concentration by approximately 50 percent. Once the serum cholesterol level approaches normal, xanthomas will gradually resolve. This treatment is inconvenient, expensive, and indicated in only a small minority of patients with PBC. Most such patients undergo liver transplantation because of severe liver disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron deficiency anemia is a problem in some patients who appear to have early stage PBC. A thorough search for a site of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is indicated even in the absence of overt bleeding. Some of these patients have unexpectedly severe portal hypertension, despite normal or nearly normal serum bilirubin and albumin concentrations and no evidence of cirrhosis on liver biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The reason for this is uncertain but has been ascribed to nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These patients may have intermittent occult bleeding from congestive gastropathy or esophageal varices, rather than the massive upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage usually associated with portal hypertension.</p><p>Therapy begins with establishing the diagnosis of iron deficiency and beginning oral iron replacement (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;</a>). If this is ineffective, the usual modalities to prevent bleeding from portal hypertension should be considered. We use the following sequence of therapies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with varices or portal hypertensive gastropathy documented by endoscopy are started on a nonselective beta blocker (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>) in a dose that lowers the resting pulse by 25 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If this is unsuccessful and chronic GI bleeding can be documented, esophageal variceal band ligation should be considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If these measures fail, distal splenorenal shunt surgery is indicated in the patient whose nutritional status, serum bilirubin, and albumin are all normal or near normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPS) and evaluation for liver transplantation are indicated in patients with more advanced PBC whose bleeding is not controlled by the preceding measures.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with advanced PBC, similar to patients with other types of end-stage cirrhosis, develop signs and symptoms of liver failure such as ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, muscle wasting, and massive bleeding from esophageal varices. Management is similar to that in other causes of liver failure. (See <a href=\"#H391206780\" class=\"local\">'Liver transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Fatigue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatigue is common in patients with PBC and can be severely debilitating. There is no proven therapy for treating fatigue. Liver transplantation does not appear to improve systemic symptoms, particularly fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. No significant benefit from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a> was observed in a randomized controlled crossover trial, while constipation occurred significantly more often than with placebo (63 versus 13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Observational data from two separate groups found a benefit from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a> (possibly because of improvement in daytime somnolence, a strong correlate of fatigue in PBC), but it has not been evaluated in randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. We use modafinil in patients with debilitating fatigue and have observed a good response in about 70 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

However, obeticholic acid is available only through specialty pharmacies in the United States and Canada. In the absence of obeticholic acid, it is the author&rsquo;s practice to use fibrates in conjunction with UDCA in patients with an inadequate response to UDCA alone. However, evidence to support this approach is limited.

Summarized briefly, UDCA (13 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) delays the progression to end-stage liver disease, enhances survival, and is well tolerated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59511%7EGAST%2F82631\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59511 graphicRef82631 \">figure 1A-B</a>). UDCA is thus advocated as first-line therapy in PBC. The extent of the biochemical response to UDCA during the first year of therapy is a simple and useful marker of long-term prognosis. About 35 percent of patients have a suboptimal response to UDCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].
