These improvements have come at the expense of increased acute and late effects, which may have a more profound effect on function and quality of life (QOL) than has been previously recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. HNC arises in structurally complex and functionally important areas. Impairment of these areas from both disease and therapy can interfere with basic functions, including eating and speech, and can have a profound effect on social interactions and psychological state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines QOL as an &quot;individual's perception of his or her position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which the patient lives and in relation to his or her goals, expectations, standards, and concerns&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A fitting description defined QOL as the &quot;perceived discrepancy between the reality of what a person has and the concept of what the person wants, needs, or expects&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In judging the efficacy of treatment, extending survival does not always correlate with improvements in QOL. Conversely, specific treatments may not necessarily prolong life but may enhance its quality. The importance of QOL has been increasingly recognized and is reflected in its use as an outcome measure in cancer research, on par with response rate and survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>].

The fundamental premise of HRQOL includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multidimensionality &ndash; QOL encompasses a broad range of domains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Physical health (eg, pain, fatigue, sleep)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Psychological (eg, body image, mood, memory, concentration)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Level of <span class=\"nowrap\">independence/function</span> (eg, mobility, activities of daily living, work capacity)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Social (eg, work, personal relationships, sexuality)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Environment (eg, financial resources, transportation resources)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Spirituality/religion/personal</span> beliefs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subjectivity &ndash; Different people may have substantially different reactions to a similar illness or disability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>QOL must be evaluated from the patient's perspective rather than the clinician or caregiver's perspective. The use of a proxy or surrogate may reflect perceptions at odds with those held by the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patient ratings are more sensitive and reliable than those of their clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>QOL and HRQOL are often used interchangeably in the literature.&nbsp;However, the broad nature of QOL can make it difficult to measure. It is preferable to use HRQOL when discussing the effects of cancer, as HRQOL focuses on the impact of treatment or disease status on QOL. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H559186648\"><span class=\"h1\">RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SYMPTOMS, FUNCTION IMPAIRMENT, AND QOL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptom burden is not the only outcome measure that impacts QOL.</p><p>A &quot;symptom&quot; is a perceived alteration in sensation or function. Function loss may be clinically apparent or subclinical. Subclinical function loss may be relevant but may elude capture on patient-reported outcomes. For example, a HNC patient may have severe silent aspiration that leads to chronic fibrotic lung damage. The impact of symptoms and functional deficits is captured on the physical, functional, and emotional domains of QOL tools. However, symptoms and functional deficits may or may not adversely impact QOL. Thus, symptom burden and functional deficits are not equivalent to QOL. Tools that assess symptom burden and functional deficits cannot be used in place of QOL as a measure of global wellbeing.</p><p>There are several possible relationships between symptoms or functional deficits and QOL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No correlation between symptom or functional deficits and QOL, regardless of severity or duration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptom intensity or functional deficits increase and QOL decreases with equal inverse proportion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only <span class=\"nowrap\">intense/severe</span> symptoms or functional deficits affect QOL, while low-intensity symptoms have no impact.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Low-intensity/severity</span> symptoms and functional deficits have a notable effect on QOL.</p><p/><p>In addition, the relationship between QOL and any given level of a specific symptom or functional deficit may assume one of the following trajectories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remain stable over time so that for any given level of a symptom or functional deficit, the impact on QOL is unchanged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient <span class=\"nowrap\">adapts/accommodates</span> to the symptom or functional deficit, and thus, QOL improves despite the fact that the symptom persists unabated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The distress of any given level of a symptom or functional deficit becomes more prominent over time, resulting in decreased QOL.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H559186654\"><span class=\"h1\">SIGNIFICANCE OF QOL MEASURES IN HNC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>QOL measures have several potential applications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>].

The interpretation of studies of QOL in patients with HNC requires caution, as different instruments measure different symptoms and aspects of QOL. The instrument should be selected carefully for a defined clinical application [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Different studies often employ diverse methodologies and varying assessment instruments, and include patients with different sites and stages of HNC. These issues make comparisons of results between studies difficult or impossible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Baseline data are necessary to attribute a decline in the level of functioning to disease or treatment-related effects. Patients with HNC often have difficulties that are unrelated to their cancer or its treatment but rather are related to comorbidities, including alcohol, tobacco, or other substance abuse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HNC is relatively uncommon, and many studies, thus, have analyzed a relatively heterogeneous patient population with regard to site of cancer within the head and neck region. These differences may influence different domains of QOL, independent of specific treatment effects. Many study samples are too small to provide adequate statistical power for comparisons or analysis by disease site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/12-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Historically, treatment approaches have varied considerably both with respect to modality of treatment (surgery, radiation therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy) and within modality (eg, type of resection or reconstruction, chemotherapy regimen, or radiation therapy technique).

HPV associated OPC often occurs in patients without a history of smoking or alcohol use. Thus, these patients are less likely to have substantial comorbid disease. Although the average age at diagnosis is only slightly younger than smoking-associated cancers, there is an increased incidence in younger patients. Finally, HPV induced OPC has a much better prognosis than its HPV negative OPC. This is reflected in the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, which has delineated separate staging systems for HPV positive and HPV negative OPC.

Given the increased comorbidities in the HPV negative population, this finding is not unexpected. In the HPV associated OPC, treatment modality did not impact QOL, symptom, or functional outcome. In addition, QOL in patients with HPV associated cancers returned to baseline or higher 12 months posttreatment<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p>In a study assessing dose radiation de-escalation in HPV positive OPC, patients with a good response to induction therapy who went on to receive 54 Gy of radiation had improved swallowing and nutrition at 12 and 24 months compared with patients who did not respond to induction therapy and were, therefore, treated with 69.3 Gy of radiation.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prevention-of-complications-during-initial-treatment-of-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prevention of complications during initial treatment of head and neck cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of late complications of head and neck cancer and its treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients often express particular concern or fear of laryngectomy. Laryngectomy is clearly associated with increased symptom control and functional issues; however, long-term QOL is not decreased after total laryngectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>]. This is likely due to adaptation of expectations with the reality faced by the patient, as well as cognitive behaviors such as benefit finding (see <a href=\"#H559186721\" class=\"local\">'Functional performance and QOL'</a> above). There is no statistical difference in QOL between horizontal supraglottic laryngectomy and partial vertical surgery, although horizontal surgery has better voice quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H174560\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is standard of care for HNC due to conformal dose distribution with improved sparing of normal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/82,91-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,91-93</a>]. One study reported over 80 percent of five-year survivors being satisfied with their QOL, highlighting the ability of IMRT to preserve long-term functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer#H1493365078\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer&quot;, section on 'Intensity-modulated RT'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definitive-radiation-therapy-for-head-and-neck-cancer-dose-and-fractionation-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definitive radiation therapy for head and neck cancer: Dose and fractionation considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prominent long-term adverse local effects of radiation therapy are hyposalivation and taste changes. The former may lead to adverse oral health outcomes, including radiation caries, periodontal disease, and osteoradionecrosis. Radiation may also cause lymphedema and fibrosis, which leads to long-term issues with jaw, neck, and shoulder range of motion and swallowing. The addition of concurrent chemotherapy exacerbates all of these side effects. If severe, symptoms and functional deficits may adversely impact overall QOL. The acute and long-term complications of radiation therapy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of late complications of head and neck cancer and its treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prevention-of-complications-during-initial-treatment-of-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prevention of complications during initial treatment of head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When radiation is used in the postoperative setting, acute and late effects tend to escalate. The adverse soft tissue toxicity of combined surgery and radiation may be severe. In one study, adjuvant radiation therapy after laryngeal surgery was the most powerful correlative with adverse outcomes in a multivariate analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p>The acute and late effects of radiation therapy may manifest differently based on the primary site. For example, laryngeal cancers are more likely to report issues with speech and taste compared with other sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/7,53,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,53,84</a>]. Cancers of the larynx are less likely to experience severe pain and have a higher probability of improvement in global QOL at one year compared with oral and pharyngeal cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/7,82,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,82,95</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H559186780\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemoradiotherapy as primary therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data comparing surgery plus adjuvant radiation with chemoradiation as primary therapy have failed to demonstrate a major overall QOL advantage for either treatment modality. For example, studies have reported similar long-term QOL for patients with advanced carcinoma of the larynx whether they underwent total laryngectomy or received concurrent chemoradiotherapy for organ conservation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>]. A study of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma showed no difference in overall health-related QOL (HRQOL) between primary chemoradiotherapy and surgery (with or without adjuvant treatment), with both groups providing acceptable HRQOL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. With regards to induction therapy versus concurrent chemoradiation, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 24954 phase III randomized controlled trial comparing combined chemotherapy with sequential induction chemotherapy and RT versus alternating chemoradiotherapy showed a trend towards worse scores in the alternating therapy arm. HRQOL returned to baseline for the majority of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. Once again, it is important to distinguish QOL for symptoms and functional deficits; differing treatment regimens, while resulting in similar overall QOL, may cause very different acute and late toxicities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3908626444\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were assessed as an exploratory endpoint in the CheckMate 141 phase III trial for platinum-refractory recurrent or metastatic HNC, in which patients were randomly assigned to either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nivolumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nivolumab</a> (3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every two weeks) or a single-agent investigator's choice of therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/health-related-quality-of-life-in-head-and-neck-cancer/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].
