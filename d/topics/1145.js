A vigilant history of associated symptoms, duration, tempo, and environmental exposure is important to determine the underlying etiology and to formulate a management plan.</p><p>This topic reviews the pathogenesis, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of flushing. The management of benign excessive sweating as well as the approach to the patient with night sweats are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-focal-hyperhidrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary focal hyperhidrosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-night-sweats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with night sweats&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flushing is a sensation of warmth accompanied by transient erythema that most commonly occurs on the face, but also may involve the neck, ears, chest, epigastrium, and arms or other areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The predilection for specific anatomical areas is likely to relate to the volume of visible superficial vessels and differences in the relative amount of cutaneous blood flow compared to other body areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>It is important to differentiate &quot;true flushing&quot; from other disorders that lead to facial erythema, such as the butterfly rash associated with systemic lupus erythematosus or photosensitivity reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It is also important to distinguish flushing from excess sweating alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flushing is a consequence of increased cutaneous blood flow secondary to vasodilation and represents part of a synchronized physiologic response of cutaneous vascular smooth muscle to a variety of autonomic or vasodilator stimuli. Flushing may be episodic, transient, or constant, depending on the etiology.</p><p>The appearance of a patient with flushing varies depending on the skin color, temperature, visibility of blood vessels beneath the skin, and capacitance of those vessels for erythrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A fixed degree of facial erythema and telangiectasias may be seen in patients who have experienced flushing over many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Vascular smooth muscle responds to both autonomic innervation and circulating vasoactive agents; changes in either of these factors can lead to a flushing response. Autonomic nerves also innervate eccrine sweat glands. Thus disorders of the autonomic nervous system tend to cause vasodilation accompanied by sweating, whereas vasoactive substances, either endogenous or exogenous, tend to cause flushing reactions alone. Autonomic-mediated flushing is often referred to as a &quot;wet&quot; flush, whereas vasoactive-mediated flushing is referred to as a &quot;dry&quot; flush [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Vasomotor innervation of specific cutaneous vessels involves either vasoconstrictor or vasodilator fibers; in most areas of the body, one will predominate over the other. Cutaneous vessels in the face are primarily innervated by vasodilator fibers that originate in the brainstem and exit with the trigeminal nerve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of flushing is broad (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53013\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53013 \">table 1</a>). Neural (autonomic) mediated flushing syndromes can be classified as thermoregulatory flushing, emotional flushing, and flushing related to a disorder of the central nervous system. Direct vasodilator-mediated flushing syndromes result from exposure to a variety of exogenous substances that have a direct effect on the vascular smooth muscle or a number of systemic disorders associated with overproduction of vasoactive agents.</p><p>An approach to the evaluation of patients with flushing is shown in an algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68454\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef68454 \">algorithm 1</a>) and discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>The most common etiologies for which a patient will present with flushing are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperthermia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menopause</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emotional blushing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rosacea</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Autonomic mediated flushing</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Thermoregulatory flushing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All forms of thermoregulatory flushing are associated with diaphoresis, which is the body's attempt to bring the core body temperature back to baseline. Thermoregulatory flushing can be caused by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heat exposure: ambient or ingested hot beverage</p><p/><p>Fever is readily diagnosed by an elevated temperature and may be caused by a variety of infectious and noninfectious etiologies. An increase in body temperature, either by exposure (ie, a very hot day) or exercise will induce a similar response.</p><p>The ingestion of a hot beverage appears to induce flushing by a countercurrent heat exchange between the internal jugular vein and the carotid artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Transmission of heat via the carotid to the anterior hypothalamus, which is exquisitely sensitive to temperature, causes a rapid flushing and sweating response. Thermoregulatory flushing can typically be avoided by allowing a hot drink to cool slightly prior to ingestion and mitigated by consuming a cold beverage or ice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Menopause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A particularly common and uncomfortable form of thermoregulatory flushing is seen around the time of menopause and is secondary to decreasing levels of circulating estrogen. The flushing reaction is best known as a &quot;hot flash.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=menopausal-hot-flashes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Menopausal hot flashes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms related to hot flashes characteristically consist of episodic sensations of heat, intense sweating, and flushing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. An estimated 50 to 80 percent of women over the age of 45 suffer from these symptoms. Surgically-induced menopause tends to cause more severe symptoms, particularly in the first year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Typical episodes last from 3 to 5 minutes and may occur up to 20 times per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. They are often very uncomfortable, anxiety-provoking, and can interfere with sleep as well as normal daily functioning.</p><p>The decrease in circulating estrogen appears to stimulate a sudden downward resetting of the body's thermostat in the hypothalamus that precedes the hot flash via unclear mechanisms. The alternation in set point causes a sensation of extreme heat and concomitant activation of both physiologic and behavioral heat loss responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Central adrenergic pathways may contribute to the reaction, as evidenced by the relief that many women gain from use of an alpha-2 agonist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Emotional flushing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emotional flushing may be a significant source of discomfort for a patient and is more common in women than men. The exact etiology of the heightened vascular response has not been determined.</p><p>It has been suggested that blushers are particularly concerned with how others perceive them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These patients often exhibit other heightened physiological reactions to stress, including palpitations, dry mouth, and a sense of cognitive dysfunction. The flushing reaction may be triggered by even minor healthy emotional responses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h4\">Neurologic disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lesions that disturb autonomic function anywhere along the nervous system can lead to flushing.

Several studies have suggested that such polymorphisms in alcohol dehydrogenase activity may increase an individual&rsquo;s susceptibility to esophageal cancer as well as oropharyngeal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Disulfiram inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase and may cause severe flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension. Co-administration of sulfonylurea medication (particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorpropamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorpropamide</a>) with alcohol is well known to cause flushing that typically begins around the eyes and spreads to the forehead [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Other medications that may cause flushing with concomitant alcohol administration include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=griseofulvin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">griseofulvin</a>, cephalosporins, antimalarials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and topical calcineurin inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Additionally, patients with underlying rhinitis or aspirin-sensitive respiratory disease may experience flushing and severe nasal congestion when drinking alcohol.

Patients with longstanding carcinoid syndrome may develop valvular heart disease (especially right-sided) and facial telangiectasias. However, only a small subset of patients with carcinoid tumors will experience symptoms of carcinoid syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of the carcinoid syndrome&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The carcinoid syndrome is primarily associated with metastatic tumors originating in the distal small intestine and proximal colon (midgut). Since the liver normally inactivates these hormones, there needs to be enough tumor burden downstream of normally functioning hepatic tissue for the mediators to enter the systemic circulation and cause symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The typical flush associated with midgut carcinoids (jejunum, ileum, cecum, appendix) begins suddenly and lasts from 30 seconds to as long as 30 minutes. It primarily involves the face, neck, and upper chest, which become red to violaceous or purple, and is associated with a mild burning sensation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55493\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55493 \">picture 1</a>). Patients often develop a drop in blood pressure as well as tachycardia during a typical flushing episode.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, bronchial, gastric, appendiceal and rectal carcinoid tumors (ie, those arising from the foregut and hindgut) can produce the carcinoid syndrome in the absence of metastatic disease because of their direct access to the systemic circulation, but this is rare overall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56015\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56015 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When they occur, the flushes associated with gastric carcinoid tumors are atypical, and tend to be red-brown hue, patchy, sharply demarcated, and serpiginous; they are also intensely pruritic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of the carcinoid syndrome&quot;, section on 'Gastric NET variant syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with the bronchial carcinoid variant, the flushes can be very severe and prolonged, lasting hours to days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. They may be associated with disorientation, anxiety, and tremor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of the carcinoid syndrome&quot;, section on 'Lung NET variant syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A variety of stimuli may trigger flushing in patients with carcinoid syndrome, including alcohol, chocolate, and ingestion of beef. It is postulated that alcohol and chocolate may release a catecholamine with direct activity on the tumor. The secretion of gastrin may also play a role, particularly in tumors of stomach or foregut origin. Alcohol and beef consumption are known to enhance gastrin secretion, which is one proposed mechanism for their mediating a carcinoid flush [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p>Potential flushing mediators include substance P, histamine, kallikrein, and kinins, although it is not absolutely clear which vasoactive hormone is responsible for symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of the carcinoid syndrome&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.) </p><p>The diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome may be made by measurement of 24 hour urine 5-hydroxyindoleoacetic acid (5-HIAA), a metabolite of serotonin. Diagnosis and tumor localization are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome-and-tumor-localization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of the carcinoid syndrome and tumor localization&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Mastocytosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mastocytosis is a rare disorder of mast cell proliferation leading to tissue infiltration.

Systemic symptoms and abnormalities in the peripheral blood smear are more common in adults. Systemic symptoms are caused by the release of mast cell mediators such as histamine and prostaglandin, which cause vasodilation, flushing, hypotension, tachycardia, and anaphylaxis. Patients may also have abdominal cramping, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and fever.</p><p>Systemic symptoms may be triggered by narcotic analgesics, as well as by agents that trigger allergic reactions such as intravenous contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other known precipitants include anesthetic agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Two related disorders (ie, idiopathic and monoclonal mast cell activation syndromes) are felt to be distinct from mastocytosis. Patients with these disorders typically present with abdominal pain, dermatographism, and flushing, and may also report headache, diarrhea, and memory or concentration difficulties.

The tumor is typically derived from the adrenal medulla, and is associated with a release of catecholamines episodically into the systemic circulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pheochromocytoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of pheochromocytoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Headaches, sweating, and tachycardia and hypertension are common; 60 percent of patients have sustained hypertension or labile blood pressure, and 40 percent experience blood pressure elevation only during attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients may experience either pallor or flushing, though flushing characteristically occurs following, rather than during, a typical attack. A feeling of apprehension is not uncommon, and patients often experience nausea, vomiting, and chest or abdominal pain. Episodes are paroxysmal in nature and last between minutes to hours.</p><p>Catecholamine-induced flushing is felt to be regulated by innervation of sympathetic vasodilator fibers of the face, as well as related to increased cardiac output. Diagnosis is made by measuring urinary catecholamine and fractionated metanephrine levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Medullary thyroid carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medullary thyroid carcinoma is a malignant tumor of parafollicular thyroid cells. Tumor cells produce calcitonin, as well as biogenic amines, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and corticotropin-releasing hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Presentation typically involves facial and upper-extremity flushing, as well as telangiectasias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medullary-thyroid-cancer-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medullary thyroid cancer: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The tumor may occur in an autosomal dominant fashion as part of the Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) syndrome or may be sporadic. Diagnosis is typically made via fine needle aspiration of a thyroid nodule and by calcitonin radioimmunoassay.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Serotonin syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The serotonin syndrome, associated with increased serotonergic activity in the central nervous system, is most often related to medication side effects and interactions. It is characterized by mental status changes, autonomic hyperreactivity, and neuromuscular hyperreactivity. Diaphoresis and hyperthermia are characteristic autonomic manifestations that may present as flushing.

Flushing occurs commonly with anaphylaxis but generally in conjunction with other symptoms such as hypotension, stridor, hives, and abdominal pain. Flushing in isolation is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Flushing is seen in almost 50 percent of anaphylactic allergic reactions to medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-flushing-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Flushing is caused by the release of mast cell as well as basophil vasoactive substances into the circulation. Diagnosis is typically based on clinical presentation, and prompt treatment with intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> is imperative.

The classic triad of gross hematuria, palpable abdominal mass, and flank pain is present in less than 10 percent of cases. Patients may also have fatigue, weight loss, fever, and anemia. Flushing, when it occurs, is felt to be due to the production of gonadotropin-like hormones from the tumor that cause a down regulation of the pituitary gland.
