A reproductive hazard interferes with the ability of a couple to achieve a successful birth. Reproductive hazards affect fertility, conception, pregnancy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delivery. Development refers to the growth and maturation of the embryo, fetus, infant, and child. A congenital defect in an organ system or limb, or an intellectual deficit that becomes manifest after birth, are examples of adverse developmental effects. Occupational and environmental risks to the reproductive system are a concern to many patients and a high public health priority [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Well-known examples of devastating outcomes from exposure to teratogens include children born with limb malformations related to maternal use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a> for insomnia or morning sickness, and children with severe neurological problems related to maternal consumption of methyl mercury contaminated fish from Minamata Bay (Japan).</p><p>This topic will review types of reproductive hazards, types of adverse outcomes, and the mechanisms by which environmental factors can impact female reproduction. Related information occupational and environmental health as well as the impact of specific agents on reproduction is presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-health\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of occupational and environmental health&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H971948403\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concerns have been fueled by reports and studies of problems to common environmental agents, including contaminants from plastics (such as bisphenol A and phthalates), chemicals that act as endocrine disruptors, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), low-level lead and mercury exposures, perchlorate, pesticides, and air pollution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Occupational exposures to these agents and others are also concerning, since a large number of women in the United States are engaged in occupations that have potential exposure to known or suspected reproductive toxicants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Additional concerns have been raised about the toxic (and cumulative) effects of (low level) exposures to the myriad industrial chemicals that are not regulated with the aim of protecting children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Exposure to small amounts of potentially toxic chemicals is common. In a study of lead, mercury, and PCB blood levels among women of childbearing age (16 to 49 years) who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 33 percent had levels at or above the median for two of these chemicals and another 23 percent had blood levels at or above the median for three of these chemicals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Although the levels of each individual agent were well below levels usually considered of clinical significance, the authors pointed out the need to study the effects of combinations of low level chemicals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF REPRODUCTIVE HAZARDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The three general categories of reproductive hazards are (1) physical factors (eg, radiation, exposure to electrical shock, excessive vibration or heat), (2) biological factors (eg, viruses, parasites), and (3) toxic agents (eg, toxicant exposure via ingestion, inhalation, or contact with skin). Some fetal toxicant exposures are concurrent with the pregnancy; however, others are the result of a previous (nonconcurrent) exposure, but with ongoing maternal elimination of the toxicant, or by mobilization of stored toxicants (eg, PCB's from fat stores, lead from bone stores) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes from exposure to toxic agents include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menstrual disorders and other hormonal influences</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infertility</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous abortion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stillbirth or infant death</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low birth weight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Congenital malformations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive changes and reduced IQ</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Developmental delays</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Childhood cancer</p><p/><p>Accurate data on baseline rates of specific adverse outcomes in the general population are difficult to assemble because of the absence of a national monitoring system in the United States and lack of comparability among epidemiological studies. Estimated frequencies of various adverse outcomes in the United States are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77872\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77872 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSING RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific environmental exposures have been linked to increased risks of the adverse outcomes discussed above. Yet the strength of the causal associations among exposures and outcomes also varies with the strength of the available data (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F99927\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99927 \">table 2</a>). Studies in humans that assess the causal relationship between specific exposures and these outcomes frequently face limitations and challenges, including lack of accurate assessment of the dose of the exposure to mother <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fetus; a need for proper control groups since a variety of other genetic, physical and socioeconomic factors affect reproductive toxicity; inadequate assessment of the background prevalence of events; difficulties with reliable ascertainment of the outcome or endpoint (eg, early abortion versus late heavy menses); and difficulties in accurate ascertainment of exposures and multiplicity of exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/6,11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11-15</a>].</p><p>The effect of ascertainment bias was illustrated by a large cohort study that assessed occupational exposures mid-pregnancy by self-report of chemical agents and by use of a job-exposure matrix that linked job titles to workplace chemical exposures according to expert judgment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. After adjustment of confounders, the authors noted that self-reported exposures were not associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes, but expert judgment-based exposure to phthalates was associated with prolonged time to pregnancy (OR 2.16, 95% CI 1.02-4.57) and pesticides were associated with decreased birth weight (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.10-5.34), although the population attributable fractions were quite small (0.7 percent). &#160;</p><p>Potential problems also arise from study design. Ideally, a prenatal developmental toxicity study and a one-, two-, or multi-generation reproduction toxicity study are recommended for evaluating the reproductive hazard of a substance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These types of studies are both cost- and time-intensive; thus, they are infrequently performed. A cross-sectional study that examines the relationship between adverse reproductive outcomes and exposures among current employees at a workplace may suffer from selection bias (&quot;healthy worker effect&quot;) due to the lack of a representative population, since individuals with health problems may not be working, thus leaving only healthy individuals remaining at work. Alternatively, if workers able to conceive were out on pregnancy leave or performing child care, then the population remaining at work may be biased toward those with fertility problems.</p><p>A case-control design would be a good method for studying rare outcomes, such as congenital defects. Case control studies, however, are sometimes limited by the focus on one specific outcome (as reflected in the case definition), and thus miss identifying other potential adverse reproductive outcomes. They may also lack optimal exposure information. A prospective cohort design allows for better measurement of exposures and confounders from the outset, but may subsequently be limited if there is excessive drop out of study participants over time. Given the limited number of human studies, efforts have been made to look at pooled data, either using a strength of the evidence approach, or a more formal meta-analysis, in order to determine or rate the strength of the evidence in support of (or against) associations between specific exposures and adverse pregnancy outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/5,15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15,17</a>].</p><p>Given limitations to high quality human data about adverse reproductive outcomes from specific agents and the large number of as yet untested chemicals, clinicians and governmental and regulatory agencies often turn to animal studies for information about potential toxicants. In evaluating the relevance of animal literature to humans, it is necessary &quot;to consider the species tested; route, timing, and dose of exposure; end points examined; systemic or maternal toxicity; litter effects; consistency among animal studies; concordance with reproductive biology; and biological plausibility of a mechanism of action&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>With these caveats in mind, information concerning relationships of environmental exposures to adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes is discussed below. A general overview of occupational and environmental health, including how to take an environmental exposure history, is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-health\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of occupational and environmental health&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple physiological events that could be affected by environmental exposures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Interference with oogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is thought that all primary oocytes of the human ovaries are formed by the fifth month of gestation, although one study of adult mice reported that new oocyte-containing follicles, presumably from stem cells, continue to develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The oocytes begin their first meiotic division in utero, and then remain arrested until puberty when ovulation commences. Damage to oocytes during fetal development from toxicants, chemotherapy, or radiation may be manifested later in life as reduced fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/1,6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,10</a>]. Toxic exposures during the woman's lifetime also may induce genetic or cytotoxic harm to oocytes, even though they are equipped with an excellent (although not foolproof) repair system. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-development-and-failure-menopause-in-normal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian development and failure (menopause) in normal women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Interference with the menstrual cycle and fertility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The menstrual cycle involves exquisitely timed rises and falls of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estrogen, and progesterone&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72415\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72415 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/1,6,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-the-normal-menstrual-cycle\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of the normal menstrual cycle&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Toxicants may interfere with hormonal synthesis and secretion and thus lead to menstrual disorders, particularly disturbances in ovulation. In addition, some chemicals can mimic or disrupt the action of naturally occurring hormones and, as a consequence, lead to reproductive or developmental effects (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Endocrine disruptors'</a> below). Menstrual disorders have been reported among women in various occupations, including athletes, agricultural workers, lead exposed women, hairdressers, shift workers, and nurses handling antineoplastic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Reduced fertility has been reported in dental assistants exposed to high levels of nitrous oxides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], cleaners exposed to elevated levels of organic solvents, such as dry cleaning chemicals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>], and industrial workers exposed to drugs or chemicals during manufacture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>These relationships were illustrated in a study of ovarian function in Southeast Asian immigrant women in which daily urine samples were tested for organochlorine compounds (including DDT, its metabolite DDE, and 10 polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners) and hormone levels; menstrual cycle parameters were also assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. DDE had effects on ovarian function (changes in cycle length, luteal phase length, level of progesterone metabolites) that could influence other endpoints such as fertility, pregnancy, and reproductive cancers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Interference with fetal development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dividing zygote reaches the uterus about three days after fertilization; implantation begins about three days later and takes about a week to complete. Toxic exposures during these first two weeks post-conception usually result in fetal loss, which may appear as late menstrual flow. During this two-week period, the embryo is less sensitive to structural damage because sublethal damage can be corrected by cellular repair processes of the rapidly dividing cells.</p><p>From the third through the eighth week of development (the period of organogenesis), the embryo is very sensitive to teratogenic insults that cause abnormalities in form or function of a developing fetus. Environmental teratogens can produce cell death, alter normal growth of tissues, or interfere with normal cellular differentiation or other morphologic processes. The consequences of these actions can be fetal loss, fetal growth restriction, birth defects, or impaired neurologic performance.</p><p>Dose and timing are important determinants of fetal effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Thus, exposures occurring at &quot;critical periods&quot; in development have specific effects related to the developmental stage of the fetal organs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56642\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56642 \">figure 2</a>) and exposure to the same agent at different times may cause different anomalies. Exposures after the first trimester may induce only minor structural abnormalities, but can still impair growth (through effects on cell division and hypertrophy) and development (through effects on cell differentiation) occurring during the second and third trimesters. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-defects-approach-to-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Birth defects: Approach to evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The fetal central nervous system (CNS) is the organ system most vulnerable to developmental injury throughout pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The fetal brain is particularly sensitive to toxins because of the incomplete blood-brain barrier; continued myelination, proliferation and pruning of neurons; and sensitivity to hypoxia. Exposure to a neurotoxin can adversely affect both structural and cognitive development. Some toxins, such as mercury, lead, and tobacco, can exert these effects throughout gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Prenatal exposure to numerous (low-level) environmental toxicants have been implicated as contributors to the development of neurodevelopmental disabilities, including autism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and other <span class=\"nowrap\">cognitive/behavioral</span> impairments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A case-control study of 970 participants reported that proximity to organophosphate pesticide application at some point during gestation was associated with a 60 percent increased risk for autism spectrum disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Environment exposures, particularly exposure to organic solvents, may play a role in development of congenital heart disease, which is the most common category of serious birth defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Environmental contaminants that have been associated with an increased risk of low birth weight <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impaired fetal growth include tobacco smoke, carbon monoxide, air pollutants, heavy metals, pesticides, chlorination byproducts, and solvents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The relationship of genetic susceptibility, epigenetic changes, environmental exposures, and reproductive outcomes is an active area of investigation. As an example, a study in China observed that organic solvent exposure was significantly related to shortened gestation and that certain combined maternal-infant gene polymorphisms modified the effect of exposure to organic solvents on gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Gene-environment interactions, particularly DNA methylation and histone modifications (&quot;epigenetic mechanisms&quot;), also appear to have a role in the development of neurological and behavior function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] and on development of asthma and allergic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physiological changes of pregnancy may alter the amount of toxin absorbed and delivered to the fetus.

If an exposure leads to direct toxicity to the mother, there may be indirect (as well as direct) adverse effects on the fetus. A mother with carbon monoxide poisoning or a severe asthma attack, as an example, may not adequately perfuse the placenta or release oxygen to the fetus. Some substances, such as mercury, may cause little or no clinical symptoms in the mother, but cause profound effects on the fetus (cerebral palsy, limb deformities, mental retardation, blindness and seizures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. In addition, job-related physical or emotional stresses could impact the course of the pregnancy.

This occurs when lactation mobilizes previously stored fat-soluble toxicants, such as dioxins, PCBs, some pesticides, and lead, which then diffuse into the mother's breast milk.</p><p>Maternal toxicokinetics, the solubility and binding properties of the toxicant, and the characteristics of breast milk determine the milk-maternal plasma <span class=\"nowrap\">(M/P)</span> ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The higher the ratio, the more substance is transferred into the breast milk. The <span class=\"nowrap\">M/P</span> ratios for lipophilic substances like PCBs range from 4 to 10, whereas the ratio for organic and inorganic mercury is 0.9 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

The best approach is to strive for elimination of exposure to persistent bio-accumulating toxic chemicals in our environment. A study that measured volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in samples from a milk bank, in milk from three mothers in non-smoking households, and from air in their homes found that their infants&rsquo; average daily dose of VOCs was 25- to 135-fold higher by inhalation than by ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p>Of note, formula feeding does not guarantee an absence of contaminants, since water used in the formula can also contain contaminants, a particularly important consideration in developing countries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There has been growing attention to the potential reproductive and non-reproductive effects of preconception and prenatal exposures to a variety of toxic environmental agents.

Studies in animals have reported that some phthalates act in as anti-androgens and interfere with development of the reproductive tract in male rodents, causing abnormalities such as absence of the epididymis, hypospadias, cryptorchidism, decreased anogenital distance (AGD), and other lesions. Because of concerns about potential adverse effects from phthalates, Europe has banned certain phthalates from cosmetics and baby toys, and some companies are voluntarily removing one common phthalate, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) from medical products, although this is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>In 2005, a study in humans looked at nine phthalate metabolites in prenatal urine as predictors of AGD and other genital measurements in 132 boys (age 2 to 36 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Urinary concentrations of four of the phthalates were inversely related to the AGD index. The shortened AGD index was felt to reflect reduced androgen action, and thus suggested phthalates' adverse effect on human male reproductive development. However, an expert panel convened by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) examined the data and found &quot;insufficient evidence in humans&quot; that DEHP exposure during pregnancy is harmful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].

This study found a dose-response relationship between monobutyl phthalate (MBP), a metabolite of dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and low sperm concentration. DBP is a phthalate used in many products, including personal care products and coatings of some medications.

After adjusting for various factors, self-reported antineoplastic drug exposure was associated with a two-fold increased risk of early (&lt;12 weeks of gestation) spontaneous abortion, while exposure to sterilizing agents was associated with a two-fold increased risk of late (12 to 20 weeks of gestation) spontaneous abortion, but not with early spontaneous abortion. A strength of the study is the large size, but recall bias and lack of information regarding measures to control exposures are limitations. To better define the risk of occupational exposure to these agents, prospective studies are needed that minimize the effects of recall bias and quantify exposure.
