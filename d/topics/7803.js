Myopathy can occur with any of the glucocorticoid preparations. The risk may be increased in older patients and in those with cancer or negative nitrogen balance prior to onset of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Similar symptoms can occur in patients with Cushing's syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The major aspects of glucocorticoid-induced myopathy will be reviewed here. Other side effects associated with glucocorticoid therapy, both oral and inhaled, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of inhaled glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids have a direct catabolic effect on skeletal muscle via effects on intermediary metabolism that provide amino acids as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Activation of the glucocorticoid receptor appears to be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>], since myopathy can be prevented by a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>An additional mechanism in critical illness was suggested in an experimental model. Glucocorticoid therapy interfered with insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) signaling, leading to increased myocyte apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids and neuromuscular blocking agents'</a> below.)</p><p>An intracellular signaling molecule with protein kinase activity known as Akt1 (a major isoform of Akt) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] may play a central role in the atrophic and hypertrophic responses of muscle to glucocorticoids and IGF-I, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Glucocorticoid-induced suppression of Akt1 ultimately results in increased amounts of the ubiquitin-ligase atrogin-1 (MAFbx) that targets muscle proteins for degradation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. Conversely, IGF-I signaling leads to enhanced activity of Akt1 that suppresses muscle atrophy and that induces muscle hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In addition to increasing muscle degradation via ubiquitination, glucocorticoids also may reduce muscle differentiation. This effect appears to be mediated by enhanced degradation via ubiquitination of MyoD, which is a master transcriptional switch for muscle development and regeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with glucocorticoid myopathy typically present with gradual onset of proximal muscle weakness, followed by atrophy of proximal muscle groups. Myalgias and muscle tenderness do not occur. Lower extremity weakness usually occurs before upper extremity weakness and is more severe. The myopathy may interfere with the activities of daily living, resulting in difficulties in getting up from a chair, climbing stairs, or performing overhead tasks.</p><p>There is wide variability in the time course of symptom onset (from a few weeks to many months after therapy has begun) that is determined, in part, by the glucocorticoid dose. In one report of patients with primary brain tumors treated with daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, two-thirds became symptomatic in the third to fourth months of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Inactivity sensitizes skeletal muscle to the catabolic effect of glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Other features of Cushing's syndrome such as moon facies, diabetes, mood alteration, skin fragility, and osteoporosis are often (but not always) present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-cushings-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and clinical manifestations of Cushing's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Glucocorticoid myopathy in patients with a systemic malignancy may present somewhat differently, with involvement of the respiratory muscles. In one report of 15 adult cancer patients, nine developed proximal muscle weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Respiratory dysfunction developed in 10, including two of six without proximal muscle weakness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Relation to glucocorticoid dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is wide variation in the dose and duration of treatment prior to the onset of muscle weakness. Some patients become weak after a low dose of glucocorticoids for a few weeks, while others never develop myopathy despite receiving large doses of glucocorticoids for months or years. Despite this variability, there is a general dose relationship with systemic glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoid myopathy is unusual in patients treated with less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or its equivalent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The higher the dose of glucocorticoid, the greater the likelihood of developing myopathy and the more rapid the onset of weakness. Daily doses in excess of 40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or its equivalent can induce clinically important weakness within two weeks and almost always result in some degree of muscle weakness when continued for more than one month.</p><p/><p>The risk of developing glucocorticoid myopathy appears to be significantly lower in patients who are treated with both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The reason for this is unclear, but may be due to induction of hepatic metabolism of dexamethasone by phenytoin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The above observations refer to systemic glucocorticoid therapy. Inhaled glucocorticoids are rarely associated with muscle weakness. Patients who take high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids absorb 20 to 40 percent of the administered dose and can develop some systemic signs. However, only isolated case reports describe muscle weakness that resolves with cessation of glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Myopathy after epidural glucocorticoid injection has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-inhaled-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of inhaled glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Experimental and some clinical observations suggest that the risk of myopathy is increased with fluorinated preparations, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a>, compared with non-fluorinated preparations such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/2,10,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10,16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no definitive diagnostic test for glucocorticoid myopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Muscle enzymes are normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]; electromyography (EMG) is usually normal, but may show low-amplitude motor unit potentials; and muscle biopsy reveals nonspecific atrophy of type IIb fibers without signs of necrosis or inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/12,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,19</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis is therefore based upon the history and timing of glucocorticoid exposure and upon the absence of other causes of myopathy. The diagnosis is generally established by demonstrating improved strength within <strong>three to four weeks</strong> after sufficient dose reduction, which is usually to doses of less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> or its equivalent. The sufficient dose reduction will vary from patient to patient, as does the dose at which weakness appears. However, there is generally some improvement in muscle strength as glucocorticoid dose is reduced to below 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> even without complete discontinuation of the glucocorticoids.</p><p>There are two settings in which the diagnosis may be particularly difficult: in patients with an underlying inflammatory myopathy, and in those treated with neuromuscular blocking agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid versus inflammatory myopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When glucocorticoids are used in the treatment of inflammatory myopathy (eg, dermatomyositis, polymyositis, or HIV myopathy), the problem of distinguishing new or worsening muscle weakness due to glucocorticoid myopathy from exacerbation of the underlying myopathy often arises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following factors can be used to establish the correct diagnosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The onset of weakness one or more months after the initiation of or an increase in glucocorticoid therapy, the presence of other cushingoid features, and normal or decreasing serum muscle enzyme levels all favor glucocorticoid myopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most definitive test is to decrease the glucocorticoid dose (if the underlying disease will allow it) and to observe the muscle strength response. Weakness due to glucocorticoid myopathy will begin to improve three to four weeks after a sufficient dose alteration, while symptoms due to an inflammatory myopathy should worsen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EMG and muscle biopsy can help distinguish between these disorders but are usually not necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids and neuromuscular blocking agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients requiring large doses of intravenous glucocorticoids and a neuromuscular blocking agent (often because of mechanical ventilation in status asthmaticus) may develop critical illness myopathy, which is characterized by severe diffuse proximal and distal weakness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromuscular weakness related to critical illness&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Major electrophysiologic findings of critical illness myopathy include normal to low-amplitude motor responses and short-duration motor unit potentials coupled with normal or near-normal sensory potentials. Needle EMG shows early or normal full recruitment. Some muscles exhibit electrical inexcitability to direct muscle stimulation. The major histopathologic findings are myopathy and myosin loss. Serum creatine kinase (CK) elevation is seen in approximately one-half of patients.</p><p>Critical illness myopathy is usually reversible over weeks to months, but it leads to prolonged ICU stays and to increased length of hospital stays overall. Treatment is directed toward discontinuation or reduction of glucocorticoids as soon as possible.</p><p>Of interest in this regard is a report of a 13-year-old girl with severe myasthenia gravis and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Treatment with massive intravenous doses of glucocorticoids resulted in generalized muscle weakness and wasting. EMG suggested myopathy, and muscle biopsy showed diffuse muscle atrophy. The anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody titer was strongly positive. It was speculated that the neuromuscular blockade due to myasthenia gravis in this patient resembled the neuromuscular blocking agents in severe asthma in sensitizing skeletal muscle to high-dose glucocorticoids and the development of an acute myopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">COURSE</span></p><p>Muscle strength begins to improve within three to four weeks after sufficient dose reduction, and eventually resolves in virtually all patients if glucocorticoid therapy can be discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In patients treated with a fluorinated preparation, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>, substituting a non-fluorinated preparation, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, can be tried if the patient cannot be weaned from glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].
