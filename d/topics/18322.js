Polyneuropathy generally develops only in patients with significantly reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and is an indication to initiate dialysis. However, patients already being adequately dialyzed may also develop polyneuropathy, although, among such patients, the polyneuropathy is often subclinical and detectable only by electrophysiologic studies.</p><p>This topic reviews uremic polyneuropathy. Uremic mononeuropathy, restless leg syndrome, and other neurologic manifestations associated with uremia or dialysis are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uremic-mononeuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uremic mononeuropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sleep-disorders-in-end-stage-renal-disease#H26619203\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sleep disorders in end-stage renal disease&quot;, section on 'Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131431718\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uremic polyneuropathy is a distal, symmetrical, mixed sensorimotor neuropathy that is characterized by demyelination and axonal degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-polyneuropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Axonal degeneration appears to be the primary abnormality and results in secondary segmental demyelination. These changes are most severe distally, and longer axons are affected first. In addition to peripheral nerve involvement, demyelination of the posterior columns and other portions of the central nervous system has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-polyneuropathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The cause of uremic polyneuropathy is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-polyneuropathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Factors that have been suggested to contribute include deficiencies of thiamine, zinc, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biotin-vitamin-h-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">biotin</a> and decreased transketolase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-polyneuropathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Increases in phenols, myoinositol, beta2-microglobulin and other middle molecular weight substances, and hyperparathyroidism have also been suggested to contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-polyneuropathy/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131431988\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uremic polyneuropathy is common among dialysis and nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Among dialysis patients, 60 to 100 percent of patients have electrophysiologic signs of impaired nerve function, although a lower percentage of patients are symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-polyneuropathy/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p>The best data regarding prevalence among nondialysis CKD patients are from an observational study that included 100 nondialysis patients between ages 18 to 65 years who had serum creatinine &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-polyneuropathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Sixty-four percent of patients had symptomatic polyneuropathy, and an additional 6 percent were asymptomatic but had abnormalities observed on nerve conduction studies or elicited with careful clinical exam. The prevalence of neuropathy increased with severity of renal dysfunction; among patients with creatinine 2 to 3.4, 3.5 to 4.9, and &gt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> the prevalence of neuropathy was 35, 89, and 100 percent, respectively.</p><p>Uremic polyneuropathy is more common in men than women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with uremic polyneuropathy initially present with sensory symptoms involving the distal aspect of the lower extremities. Early sensory symptoms include paresthesias such as tingling or prickling. Burning pain develops as neuropathy becomes more severe.</p><p>Symptoms progress proximally; once the sensory defects have moved to or above the knees, patients may develop symptoms in their hands.</p><p>Patients with more advanced disease develop motor symptoms including weakness of distal muscles, myoclonus, and even paralysis. These symptoms rarely if ever occur before the onset of sensory symptoms.</p><p>On physical examination, the initial findings in uremic polyneuropathy include loss of position and vibration sense in the toes and decreased deep tendon reflexes, beginning with the Achilles reflex. Paradoxical heat sensation is another sensory manifestation, in which application of low-temperature stimuli evokes the sensation of high temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-polyneuropathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Among patients with more advanced disease, physical examination may reveal muscle atrophy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of polyneuropathy is suggested by the clinical presentation and confirmed by electrophysiologic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-polyneuropathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle-disease#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of peripheral nerve and muscle disease&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic testing'</a>.)</p><p>Motor nerve conduction velocity, often measured in the peroneal nerve, is the most common parameter used to assess motor function. Sensory nerve conduction velocity of the sural nerve is even more sensitive in detecting early dysfunction but is not as widely used.</p><p>The nerves from the extremity that has the fistula or graft should not be used for electrophysiologic studies, since results are affected by local lesions related to the dialysis access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-polyneuropathy/abstract/10,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15</a>].</p><p>In addition to early diagnosis, electrophysiologic testing can also be used to monitor the course of disease once renal replacement therapy is initiated; however, this is rarely done if clinical symptoms of neuropathy respond to dialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H131431995\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uremic polyneuropathy is difficult to distinguish from multiple other types of polyneuropathies caused by diseases that also cause chronic kidney disease (CKD). These diseases include diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic vasculitides, multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, and graft-versus-host disease. These diseases are generally excluded by history.</p><p>A rapidly evolving motor polyneuropathy has been described among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, with features of Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-polyneuropathy/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in adults: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy'</a>). In almost all cases, the underlying renal disease was membranous nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-polyneuropathy/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. However, the acute presentation and predominance of motor symptoms distinguishes this entity from uremic polyneuropathy.</p><p>A complete differential diagnosis and the diagnostic evaluation of polyneuropathy are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-polyneuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of polyneuropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-polyneuropathy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of polyneuropathy&quot;, section on 'Etiology and pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who are not yet on dialysis, uremic polyneuropathy is an indication for renal replacement therapy, including either dialysis or transplantation. Both dialysis and transplantation are effective in stabilizing or improving the symptoms of polyneuropathy, although transplantation is generally more effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-polyneuropathy/abstract/7,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,19</a>]. It is likely that hemodialysis and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) are equally effective in reducing symptoms of polyneuropathy.</p><p>Among patients who are on dialysis, symptoms of uremic neuropathy are an indication to determine if the dialysis prescription is adequate and usually to increase the amount of delivered dialysis, even if the minimum target <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> is being achieved with the current prescription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some patients will have persistent symptoms of neuropathy despite increasing the amount of dialysis. For suitable transplantation candidates, transplantation may reverse the symptoms of neuropathy, even when dialysis has failed to do so [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-polyneuropathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, some patients are not suitable transplant candidates, and even suitable candidates may be waiting for a deceased-donor kidney for a number of years. In addition, some patients elect not to undergo dialysis despite the onset of uremia.</p><p>For such patients, pharmacologic treatment of neuropathy may be effective.</p><p>Based upon studies of nonuremic polyneuropathy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> may be used. A suggested dose is 100 to 200 mg per day plus an additional 300 mg after each hemodialysis session for those on dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-polyneuropathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-polyneuropathy#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of polyneuropathy&quot;, section on 'Treatment of symptoms and prevention of complications'</a>.)</p><p>If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> is ineffective or not tolerated, a tricyclic antidepressant may be used (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desipramine</a> 10 to 50 mg at night).</p><p>Physical exercise may prevent the loss of muscle power [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-polyneuropathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. As with other types of neuropathy, the appropriate use of ankle-foot orthoses, splints, and walking assistance devices can significantly improve lifestyle in the face of significant disability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-polyneuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of polyneuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with distal polyneuropathy are at increased risk for developing foot ulcers; proper foot and nail care is especially important in this population. Regular visits to a podiatrist can also help prevent problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H434349410\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree to which polyneuropathy improves with dialysis is directly related to the severity of clinical symptoms prior to initiation. Complete resolution may occur among patients who have only mild sensory symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-polyneuropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], although subclinical abnormalities may still be detectable by electrophysiologic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-polyneuropathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Among patients with more severe neurologic symptoms, neurologic symptoms may persist even after many years of dialysis.</p><p>Renal transplantation completely reverses the symptoms of neuropathy, except among the most severely affected patients. The clinical course after transplantation is often biphasic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uremic-polyneuropathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. There is initial rapid improvement, which occurs over days or weeks; this phase is then followed by continued, gradual improvement over a period of several months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24108764\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uremic polyneuropathy is common among dialysis and nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.
