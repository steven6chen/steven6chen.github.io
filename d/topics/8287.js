The occurrence of an extremely high number of cases of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) was noted early in the AIDS epidemic and many of them had an unusually aggressive clinical course. KS was therefore included as an AIDS-defining illness in early case definitions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and invasive cervical carcinoma were subsequently added as AIDS-defining conditions.</p><p>The spectrum of neoplasia in HIV infected patients has changed in areas where the use of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) is widespread. The incidence of KS and NHL has decreased markedly, but there has been a relative increase in tumor types that collectively are referred to as non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs) compared with the general population. NADCs now are a major factor contributing to mortality in HIV-infected people.</p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology and pathogenesis of malignancy in people infected with HIV. General management considerations for these malignancies, as well as epidemiologic features and management considerations for specific tumor types are discussed separately.

In most patients, ART causes both an immunologic response manifested by normalization CD4 lymphocyte counts and a virologic response with nearly complete suppression of HIV viral replication. Both immunologic and virologic responses are important in achieving at least partial immune restoration, thus decreasing the incidence of opportunistic infections, reducing the risk of developing NHL or KS, and prolonging survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].

The incidence of cancers was broken down into three periods: 1985 to 1996 (pre-ART), 1997 to 2001 (early ART), and 2002 to 2006 (late ART). </p><p>In this study, the incidence of AIDS-defining cancers compared with the non HIV infected population fell progressively (standardized incidence ratios [SIRs] 136, 28, and 15, respectively). Furthermore, the AIDS-defining cancers comprised a progressively smaller percentage of the cancer burden in the HIV population. Among the patients with AIDS or HIV infection, AIDS-defining cancers accounted for 467 of 529 malignancies (88 percent) in the pre-ART period, 89 of 189 (47 percent) in the early ART period, and 46 of 140 (33 percent) in the late ART period. Similar trends have been reported in other large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>].</p><p>The impact of immunosuppression on the incidence of specific AIDS-defining malignancies since the introduction of potent ART is illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Swiss HIV Cohort study, KS had a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 246 compared to the non-HIV infected population and comprised 51 percent of all cancers and 58 percent of the AIDS-defining cancers in the pre-ART period (1985 to 1996) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. By the late-ART period (2002 to 2006), the incidence of KS had fallen dramatically, and was approximately 23 times higher than the general population. In that period, KS comprised 30 percent of AIDS defining malignancies and 10 percent of the total cancer burden in the HIV infected study population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similarly, the incidence of NHL relative to the non-HIV infected population fell progressive through these same periods (SIRs 103, 27, and 16, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

As in other studies, the incidence of KS significantly decreased (1839 versus 335 per 100,000 person-years) as did the incidence of NHL (1066 versus 390 per 100,000 person-years). The incidence of KS and NHL was inversely correlated with the CD4 cell count.

Before the introduction of potent ART, malignancies accounted for fewer than 10 percent of all deaths among HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].

This increased risk was due almost exclusively to KS and NHL (SIRs 1694 versus 1146 for KS and 338 versus 116 for NHL, respectively, during these same time periods). The only non-AIDS defining malignancy for which there was a significant increase compared to the general population was leiomyosarcoma.

A cohort study including nearly 90,000 patients with HIV found that while the cumulative incidences of anal, liver, and colorectal cancer by age 75 years (approximating the lifetime risk) have increased over time, this increase was not explained by an equivalent increase in risk of developing these cancers at any given point in time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Rather, an overall decrease in mortality also observed in these patients suggests that because they are living longer, they are more likely to develop these types of cancers.</p><p>However, other data suggest that certain malignancies such as KS or lymphoma may occur soon after the initiation of ART, arguing that the treatment itself rather than the increased life expectancy it confers may predispose towards these cancers.

In this cohort, a total of 457 cancers developed within 10 years after ART was begun. There was a much higher incidence of KS during the first six months after ART initiation, and this was attributed to the more severe immunosuppression present when treatment was started and possibly to unmasking of subclinical KS as part of the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Similarly, a higher incidence of lymphomas was seen immediately after initiation of ART, followed by a decreasing incidence thereafter. For other malignancies, there was a gradually increasing incidence of cancer over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV-infected individuals have an increased incidence of a wide range of malignancies, including both AIDS-defining malignancies (Kaposi's sarcoma [KS], cervical cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL] including systemic NHL, CNS lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and Castleman's disease), as well as a number of non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs). (See <a href=\"#H1560489307\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors contributing to pathogenesis may include direct effects of HIV, immunosuppression, coinfection with other oncogenic viruses, other environmental oncogenic stimuli, and possibly ART itself. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (potent ART) has prevented severe immunosuppression for prolonged periods in most HIV-infected individuals in the United States and Europe. This has been associated with substantial decreases in the incidence of KS and NHL, and a relatively better prognosis in response to treatment than in the pre-potent ART era. (See <a href=\"#H1560489307\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of NADCs is increased compared to the non-HIV-infected population, and cancer deaths from these NADCs account for an increasing fraction of the deaths in HIV-infected individuals.
