The end point, stroke, is biologic (tissue injury) rather than arbitrary (&ge;24 hours). In keeping with this definition of TIA, ischemic stroke is defined as an infarction of central nervous system tissue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack#H2074998073\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and clinical manifestations of transient ischemic attack&quot;, section on 'Definition of TIA'</a>.)</p><p>TIA was originally defined as a sudden onset of a focal neurologic symptom <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sign lasting less than 24 hours and caused by reversible cerebral ischemia. However, this classic, time-based definition of TIA was inadequate for several reasons. Most notably, there is risk of permanent tissue injury (ie, infarction) even when focal transient neurologic symptoms last less than one hour. Furthermore, about one-half of patients with classically defined TIA syndromes (&lt;24 hours in duration) have corresponding appropriate ischemic lesions by brain MRI on diffusion-weighted or perfusion-weighted imaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack#H369801432\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and clinical manifestations of transient ischemic attack&quot;, section on 'Symptom duration and infarction'</a>.)</p><p>Thus, the benign connotation of the term TIA has been replaced by an understanding that even relatively brief ischemia can cause permanent brain injury.</p><p>Although the revised tissue-based definition is favored by guidelines, the traditional time-based definition of TIA is still widely used in clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4080300960\"><span class=\"h2\">How is minor stroke defined?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minor ischemic stroke has been defined in various ways, most often by a low score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>], and there is no unified definition. We prefer to define minor stroke by the absence of a persistent neurologic deficit that is potentially disabling. Any of the following should be considered disabling deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete hemianopia: &ge;2 on the NIHSS question 3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61698\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61698 \">table 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe aphasia: &ge;2 on NIHSS question 9</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual or sensory extinction: &ge;1 on NIHSS question 11</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any weakness limiting sustained effort against gravity: &ge;2 on NIHSS question 5 or 6</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any deficits that lead to a total NIHSS &gt;5 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-national-institutes-of-health-stroke-scale-nihss-score\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to walk</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any remaining deficit considered potentially disabling by the patient, family, or the treating practitioner</p><p/><p>Patients who present within the appropriate time window after ischemic symptom onset with a persistent neurologic deficit that is potentially disabling, despite improvement of any degree, should be treated with intravenous thrombolysis in the absence of other contraindications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71462\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71462 \">table 2</a>).

Furthermore, immediate intervention after a TIA may prevent a significant number of strokes. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Risk of recurrent stroke'</a> below and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Immediate treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis of TIA (in the absence of tissue infarction) is clinical, and is based upon a determination that the symptoms of the attack are more likely caused by brain ischemia than another cause. This determination can be challenging and is usually subjective because the symptoms of TIA are transient, highly variable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71676 \">table 3</a>), and often minor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack#H4119305933\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and clinical manifestations of transient ischemic attack&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of transient ischemic attack and stroke&quot;, section on 'Symptoms of TIA'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of transient ischemic attack and stroke&quot;, section on 'Distinguishing transient attacks'</a>.)</p><p>The initial evaluation of suspected TIA and minor (ie, nondisabling) ischemic stroke includes basic laboratory studies that are suggested by the history and physical examination, an electrocardiogram, brain imaging, and neurovascular imaging.

Although 2009 <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ASA</span> guidelines advocated the use of ABCD<sup>2</sup> score, subsequent studies found that the score does not provide an accurate estimate of stroke risk and clinical decisions based on an ABCD<sup>2</sup> score cut-off are subject to significant misclassification error. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification'</a> below.)</p><p>Hospital admission for TIA may be cost effective compared with no admission or specific intervention, particularly for high-risk patients eligible for intravenous (IV) tPA treatment. Supporting evidence comes from a cost-utility analysis of 24-hour hospitalization in the United States for patients diagnosed with recent TIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The study assumed that only those patients without absolute contraindications for IV tPA treatment would be admitted, and that hospitalized patients who developed a new stroke would be identified and treated with tPA within one hour of stroke onset. The overall cost effectiveness ratio was 55,044 dollars per quality adjusted life year, a value considered borderline cost effective. However, admission was cost effective for patients with a 24-hour stroke risk &gt;5 percent. In contrast, a subsequent report found that hospital admission for TIA was not cost effective in the United States compared with urgent (same-day) outpatient clinic evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], despite increased access to tPA in the hospital.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Brain imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain imaging with MRI or CT is indicated in all patients with suspected TIA or minor (nondisabling) stroke as soon as possible, particularly those with symptoms suggestive of hemispheric TIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. Brain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging has a greater sensitivity than CT for detecting small infarcts in patients with TIA; thus CT is a suboptimal alternative. The 2009 <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ASA</span> guidelines recommend neuroimaging within 24 hours of symptom onset and further recommend MRI and diffusion-weighted MR imaging as preferred modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Head CT is recommended if MRI cannot be performed.</p><p>The presence of a brain infarct on MRI or CT scan located in an area suggested by the anatomy of the TIA or stroke identifies an ischemic etiology of symptoms. Many patients whose clinical history and neurologic examination suggest that an attack was transient have infarcts in brain areas appropriate to the neurologic symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack#H369801432\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and clinical manifestations of transient ischemic attack&quot;, section on 'Symptom duration and infarction'</a>.)</p><p>Infarction is more likely to be identified acutely on MRI than on CT. Diffusion-weighted MRI imaging (DWI) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map that is derived from DWI can discriminate tissue injury very early after the onset of ischemic symptoms. In most but not all cases of TIA and minor (nondisabling) stroke, early DWI and ADC can confirm whether only ischemia has occurred or if there has also been an element of infarction, thereby differentiating stroke from TIA within the first hours after symptom onset. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroimaging of acute ischemic stroke&quot;, section on 'CT versus MRI techniques in hyperacute stroke'</a>.)</p><p>DWI is advantageous for evaluating patients who have transient symptoms because it is highly sensitive for detecting infarction, thereby confirming an ischemic cause. A systematic review found that DWI detects corresponding appropriate ischemic lesions in 16 to 67 percent of patients with classically defined (ie, time-based) TIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Also, the combination of DWI with MRI and MRA often provides clues to the underlying pathophysiology.</p><p>DWI also has an advantage in differentiating acute infarction from chronic lesions. One study estimated that the amount of error potentially imposed by the use of conventional MRI in identifying the clinically responsible infarct in patients with time-based TIA could be as high as 50 percent when compared with DWI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This is, in large part, because infarctions associated with time-based TIA are often very small. A volumetric study of TIA-related infarcts showed that 96 percent of all infarcts were smaller than 1 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The smallest single lesion that was associated with a time-based TIA was 0.17 mL in volume. The mean infarct volume was 0.66 &plusmn; 1.20 mL.</p><p>The timing of DWI scan is important. In some cases, lesions identified by early DWI may reverse back to normal with rapid reconstitution of blood flow to the ischemic brain tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack#H369801432\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and clinical manifestations of transient ischemic attack&quot;, section on 'Symptom duration and infarction'</a>.)</p><p>In a minority of cases, early DWI may fail to identify an ischemic mechanism:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DWI may occasionally miss small infarctions, especially in the brain stem, often in patients presenting with a lacunar TIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In these cases, follow-up MRI or CT may confirm an infarct.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The reduction in blood flow that is sufficient to cause symptoms may not be severe enough to cause an abnormal signal on DWI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In such cases, perfusion-weighted MRI can provide additional information for determining the presence of tissue ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. </p><p/><p>Other diseases that mimic TIAs may be identified by neuroimaging techniques, although pathological biopsy examination is occasionally needed (eg, temporal artery biopsy or examination of the cerebrospinal fluid). In rare cases, brain biopsy is indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of transient ischemic attack and stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurovascular evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The single most important issue to resolve in the initial evaluation of TIA and ischemic stroke is whether or not there is an obstructive lesion in a larger artery supplying the affected territory. Noninvasive options for evaluation of large vessel occlusive disease include magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), carotid duplex ultrasonography (CDUS), and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD). The choice among these depends upon local availability and expertise as well as individual patient characteristics and preferences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroimaging of acute ischemic stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The 2009 <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ASA</span> guidelines recommend routine noninvasive imaging of the cervicocephalic vessels as part of the evaluation of patients with suspected TIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The guidelines note that it is reasonable to obtain noninvasive testing of the intracranial vasculature if knowledge of an intracranial stenosis or occlusion will alter management.</p><p>Although noninvasive studies are considered reliable for the exclusion of intracranial stenosis, the 2009 <span class=\"nowrap\">AHA/ASA</span> guidelines conclude that reliable diagnosis of the presence and degree of intracranial stenosis requires evaluation with catheter angiography to confirm abnormalities detected with noninvasive testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A focused Doppler and neuroimaging test (eg, MRA or CTA) can be used to establish an arterial source of the embolism or low flow. These tests can exclude an arterial source in cases where the symptoms are due to proximal embolism from the heart, aorta, or an unknown source, and in cases where the symptoms are due to small vessel disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-carotid-artery-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of carotid artery stenosis&quot;</a>). The following are important aspects regarding such testing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duplex ultrasound and transcranial Doppler studies require considerable technical skill to perform and an experienced interpreter. They should be used only if there is adequate confidence that the testing and interpretation is reliable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conventional angiography is associated with a small risk of stroke and should be performed by experienced physicians. It should only be considered when the diagnosis is uncertain by noninvasive methods, and when proof of the diagnosis is essential for proper stroke preventive therapy. As an example, if one of the stroke-producing arterial lesions noted above is suspected but not confirmed by conventional noninvasive Doppler, MRI, or CT methods, then angiography can be considered.</p><p/><p>The distinction between artery-to-artery and other (mainly cardiac) sources of embolism can be difficult. Suspicion of the former typically arises once vascular pathology in a large vessel has been identified (eg, with noninvasive testing). Repetitive spells within a single vascular territory are also suggestive of an artery-to-artery source, as is a normal echocardiogram.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A possible cardiac source should be considered in patients with TIA or ischemic stroke caused by embolism. At minimum, such patients should have a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram as soon as possible after symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Cardiac monitoring is an essential part of evaluation to exclude atrial fibrillation in the setting of embolic TIA or stroke. Cardiac rhythm monitoring with inpatient telemetry or Holter monitor is useful for patients without a clear etiology after initial brain imaging and electrocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

This risk is illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of 11 observational studies published through December 2006 found that the risk of stroke at 2 days, 30 days, and 90 days after TIA was 3.5, 8.0, and 9.2 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In the three studies that used active ascertainment of stroke outcome (ie, face-to-face evaluation by a practitioner rather than use of administrative data), the 2, 30, and 90 day risk of stroke after TIA was even higher (9.9, 13.4, and 17.3 percent, respectively). Similar findings were reported in a meta-analysis of 18 cohorts published through June 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A well-designed prospective cohort study of 2447 participants from the Dutch TIA trial, published in 2005, found that the risk for major vascular events and stroke was highest shortly after TIA or minor stroke, declined to its lowest point at about three years, and then progressively increased over the remainder of the 10-year follow-up (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F53609\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53609 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In contrast, the risk for mortality gradually rose throughout the study. By 10 years, 60 percent had died and 54 percent had experienced new vascular events (stroke and myocardial infarction). Event-free survival was 48 percent. Predictive factors for risk of vascular events and death included age over 65 years, diabetes, claudication, previous vascular surgery, and pathologic Q waves on baseline electrocardiogram.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2016 report from the TIAregistry.org project, a prospective multinational registry of over 4700 patients with TIA or minor stroke (defined by a modified Rankin scale score of 0 or 1 when first evaluated), the estimated risks of stroke at days 2, 30, 90, and 365 after the index event were 1.5, 2.8, 3.7, and 5.1 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. These rates are lower than those previously reported, possibly due to the more rapid implementation of newer and more effective strategies for the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke; the registry included only sites with dedicated systems for the urgent evaluation of TIA, and most patients were seen by a stroke specialist within 24 hours of symptom onset. Independent risk factors for recurrent stroke were multiple infarctions on brain imaging, large artery atherosclerosis, and an ABCD<sup>2</sup> score of 6 or 7. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The urgency associated with TIA derives also from the observation that TIAs are most likely to occur in the hours and days immediately preceding ischemic stroke. As an example, a study that analyzed four cohorts of patients who had recent ischemic stroke found that TIAs occurred most often in the 48 hours prior to the stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Another study found that the risk of ischemic stroke occurring within 24 hours of a probable or definite TIA was approximately 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Of all ischemic strokes during the 30 days after a first TIA, 42 percent occurred within the first 24 hours. This may be an overestimate related to the difficulty distinguishing a single ischemic event (stroke) with fluctuating symptoms from separate events (TIA followed by stroke) within a short period of time. Nevertheless, these observations underscore the high early risk of developing a permanent deficit after transient ischemic symptoms and the importance of urgent assessment, risk stratification, and treatment.</p><p>Given this short time window and high risk of stroke (1.5 to 3.5 percent in the first 48 hours after TIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28</a>]) neurologic evaluation of and intervention for TIA should occur urgently. Furthermore, clinical TIAs associated with evidence of infarction by neuroimaging may be a marker of particularly high risk for ischemic stroke. (See <a href=\"#H979759\" class=\"local\">'Importance of infarction'</a> below.)</p><p>Recognition and urgent evaluation of TIAs can identify patients who may benefit from preventive therapy or from revascularization of large vessels such as the carotid artery. As examples, premonitory carotid territory TIAs occur in approximately 50 to 75 percent of patients with ischemic stroke from extracranial carotid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>], and vertebrobasilar TIAs are associated with a risk of subsequent stroke or death that is similar to or possibly higher than that seen with carotid TIAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-minor-ischemic-stroke/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H311703\"><span class=\"h2\">TIA etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TIA caused by vascular pathologies (ie, large artery atherosclerosis and small vessel disease) appears to confer a higher risk of subsequent stroke than cardiac and other nonvascular subtypes of TIA.

Laboratory testing is helpful in ruling out metabolic and hematologic causes of neurologic symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Urgent evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traditionally defined TIA (ie, time-based, lasting &lt;24 hours) and minor ischemic stroke are associated with a high early risk of recurrent stroke. The stroke risk in the first two days after TIA is approximately 4 to 10 percent. The ABCD<sup>2</sup> score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62381\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62381 \">table 5</a>) was designed to identify patients at high risk of ischemic stroke in this time period, but its predictive performance is not optimal. Risk stratification models that combine information from brain imaging, neurovascular imaging, and presumed TIA etiology in addition to the clinical ABCD<sup>2</sup> score may improve the accuracy of stroke risk prediction after TIA. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Risk of recurrent stroke'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accumulating evidence suggests that immediate evaluation and intervention after a TIA or minor ischemic stroke reduces the risk of recurrent stroke. For patients who present with TIA or minor ischemic stroke, we recommend implementation of appropriate diagnostic evaluation and stroke prevention treatment without delay, preferably within one day of the ischemic event (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
