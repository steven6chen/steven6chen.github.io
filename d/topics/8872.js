In order to get a woman pregnant, a man needs to have a normal number of healthy sperm. Doctors call this a &quot;normal sperm count.&quot; Men with infertility can have 1 of the following problems with their sperm:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They have no sperm at all</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They do not have enough sperm &ndash; This is called having a &quot;low sperm count.&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They have unhealthy sperm &ndash; The sperm might move too slowly or have abnormal shapes.</p><p/><p>There are many reasons that men can have an abnormal sperm count. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems in the testicles, such as a block in the vas deferens &ndash; The vas deferens is the tube the sperm travels through to reach the penis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F68075\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68075 \">figure 1</a>). A block can be caused by a past infection or by a vasectomy. A vasectomy is a surgery a man can choose to have so that he can't get a woman pregnant. In a vasectomy, a doctor cuts or blocks the vas deferens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F68075\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68075 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having low levels of the hormone testosterone</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic problems that men might be born with</p><p/><p>But most of the time, doctors cannot explain why a man has an abnormal sperm count.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459360770\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I see a doctor?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, doctors recommend that a man be tested if a couple cannot get pregnant after having unprotected sex for 1 year. At that time, both the man and the woman are often tested. But if you are worried, talk with your doctor or nurse. He or she might recommend that you have tests done sooner. If your partner is over age 35 and has not gotten pregnant after 6 months of trying, your doctor will start tests at that time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459360777\"><span class=\"h1\">What tests will I have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor will order a test called a &quot;sperm count&quot; to check your sperm. This test counts your sperm and checks to see how healthy they are. For this test, a man needs to provide a sample of his sperm.</p><p>If your sperm count is low, your doctor will repeat the test 1 or more times. If repeat sperm counts are still abnormal, your doctor might do other tests. For example, he or she might do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An exam to measure the size of your testicles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests to see if there is a block in your testicles</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459360784\"><span class=\"h1\">What treatments can help men with infertility?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different treatments can help men with infertility still be able to father children. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormone treatment to increase sperm counts &ndash; Some men have low hormone levels and can be treated with hormone shots.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to open up a block in the testicle &ndash; For example, a man who had a vasectomy in the past can have surgery to reopen the tube the sperm travels through (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F68075\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68075 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In vitro fertilization, also called &quot;IVF&quot; &ndash; During IVF, a doctor takes an egg or eggs from a woman and sperm from a man. He or she puts them together in a test tube so that the sperm can fertilize an egg. Then the fertilized egg is put into the woman's uterus to grow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 2</a>). Many times, a doctor will do a treatment called &quot;intracytoplasmic sperm injection,&quot; or &quot;ICSI,&quot; along with IVF. During ICSI, a doctor takes only 1 sperm and injects it into the egg. IVF with ICSI is often used for men who have low sperm counts or abnormal sperm. But this treatment can also be used for men who have no sperm in their sample. This is because these men might still have sperm in their testicles that a doctor can take out and use for the procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459360791\"><span class=\"h1\">Do treatments always work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. Treatments do not always help a couple get pregnant. The same treatment might help one couple get pregnant, but not another couple.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459360798\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I decide which treatment to have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Talk with your doctor about the benefits and downsides of the different treatments. To choose the treatment that is right for you and your partner, you might want to think about:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How well your doctor thinks the treatment will work</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cost of the treatment &ndash; Health insurance pays for treatment in some states, but not all.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How long your doctor thinks the treatment will take</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Downsides of the treatment</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459360805\"><span class=\"h1\">What choices do I have if I choose to stop or not have treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Couples who choose to stop or not have treatment have other options. They can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try to have a baby using another man's sperm, such as sperm from a sperm bank (called &quot;donor&quot; sperm)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adopt a child</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not have children of their own</p><p/><p>Couples can have a tough time making these decisions. You might find it helpful to talk to a counselor or go to a support group for people who are facing the same issues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459360812\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infertility-in-couples-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Infertility in couples (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infertility-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Infertility in women (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=androgen-replacement-in-men-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Androgen replacement in men (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-infertile-couple-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Evaluation of the infertile couple (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization-ivf-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: In vitro fertilization (IVF) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovulation-induction-with-clomiphene-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ovulation induction with clomiphene (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infertility-treatment-with-gonadotropins-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Infertility treatment with gonadotropins (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
