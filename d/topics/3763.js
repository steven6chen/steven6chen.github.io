They may represent a stable disruption of the epithelial mesenchymal transition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-staging-and-treatment-of-uterine-carcinosarcoma/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. They are considered a high-risk variant of endometrial adenocarcinoma because carcinosarcomas share similarities in epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical behavior more closely with endometrial carcinoma as opposed to uterine sarcomas. </p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, staging, and treatment of uterine carcinosarcoma will be discussed in this topic review.

As an example, in the United States, the incidence of carcinosarcoma is approximately 1 to 4 per 100,000 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-staging-and-treatment-of-uterine-carcinosarcoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Carcinosarcomas occur in older women; the median age at diagnosis ranges from 62 to 67 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-staging-and-treatment-of-uterine-carcinosarcoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Progestin-containing contraceptives are protective against both types of neoplasms. A history of exposure to pelvic radiation is also associated with an increased risk of developing uterine carcinosarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-staging-and-treatment-of-uterine-carcinosarcoma/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not possible to distinguish carcinosarcoma from endometrial carcinoma or uterine sarcoma based on clinical features.

CT scan can also detect myometrial invasion, nodal involvement, and the presence of metastatic disease. This is important because up to 30 percent of patients have node involvement at presentation, and over 17 percent present with metastatic disease (most commonly involving the lung, liver, and bones) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-staging-and-treatment-of-uterine-carcinosarcoma/abstract/22,26,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,26,29</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173217643\"><span class=\"h3\">FDG PET/CT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Positron emission tomography (PET) using (18)-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) with or without CT can be used for diagnostic and initial staging purposes.

Based on the sarcomatous elements, carcinosarcoma is often described as <strong>homologous</strong>, if the sarcomatous element is native to uterine tissue, or <strong>heterologous</strong>, if the sarcoma is not native to uterine tissue. The most common <span class=\"nowrap\">carcinoma/sarcoma</span> combination is a mixed homologous tumor consisting of a high-grade serous carcinoma and an endometrial stromal sarcoma. However, different histologies are possible for each of the two components.

Uterine carcinosarcoma is considered one of the best examples of a stable epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) characterized by transdifferentiation, expression of mesenchymal markers (altered cadherins and expression of the transcription factor, Snail), and a greater migratory potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-staging-and-treatment-of-uterine-carcinosarcoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469729240\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION OF SUSPECTED DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine carcinosarcoma is a histologic diagnosis. It is not possible to distinguish carcinosarcoma from endometrial carcinoma or uterine sarcoma based upon symptoms, laboratory evaluation, or imaging findings. For women presenting with a clinical suspicion of a uterine malignancy, endometrial sampling is usually performed prior to definitive surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-staging-and-treatment-of-uterine-carcinosarcoma/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. However, if the endometrial biopsy is negative but clinical suspicion remains high, further work-up is required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-endometrium-for-malignant-or-premalignant-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the endometrium for malignant or premalignant disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because carcinosarcoma arises from the endometrial lining, it is theoretically more amenable to diagnosis by endometrial sampling than pure uterine sarcomas. However, one study highlights that sampling may not be an accurate test for the diagnosis of uterine carcinosarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-staging-and-treatment-of-uterine-carcinosarcoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In a study involving 51 women with carcinosarcoma, preoperative sampling was diagnostic in 59 percent (30 of 51) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-staging-and-treatment-of-uterine-carcinosarcoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In 16 additional cases, the presence of malignancy was established by endometrial sampling, and in the majority, it was due to the detection of the carcinomatous component.

This usually involves pelvic sonography with or without directed biopsy. The evaluation is similar to that in women with suspected endometrial cancer.

(See <a href=\"#H28301145\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p>There are no studies to suggest a preferred modality. In our practice, we suggest at least a computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis for an extent of disease evaluation. This information is necessary to inform the appropriate treatment plan. While positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> may be used instead of CT, there are only limited data to suggest that <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> yields more information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-staging-and-treatment-of-uterine-carcinosarcoma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

PET excluded bone metastases (suggested on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) in two patients, enabling them to undergo surgical treatment. PET findings resulted in the upstaging of five patients, and four of these were deemed inoperable based on the PET results. However, the use of PET was not associated with an improvement in overall survival compared with historic controls.

We suggest chemotherapy rather than adjuvant RT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, some experts also administer vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) to these patients to reduce the risk of a local recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> in the adjuvant setting rather than an ifosfamide-based combination (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

A choice between agents should be individualized, taking into account the prior toxicities the patient has experienced and the toxicities associated with an alternative agent. However, in light of the limited evidence of a survival benefit with treatment, hospice care is also reasonable, particularly for patients at risk for significant treatment-related toxicity.
