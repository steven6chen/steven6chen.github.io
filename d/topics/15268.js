Cytokines are important mediators of immune responses that allow integration of the behavior of cells in time and geographical location as immune responses are generated.</p><p>Cytokine-directed treatments are being developed by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry as therapeutic agents for a number of autoimmune diseases. Clinicians using these treatments should understand the role of cytokines in the normal immune system, a topic that is reviewed here. The role of cytokines in the pathogenesis and treatment of rheumatic disorders is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-cytokines-in-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of cytokines in rheumatic diseases&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytokine networks in rheumatic diseases: Implications for therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF IMMUNE RESPONSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immune system is organized into innate and adaptive immune responses, with adaptive immunity further subdivided into two branches, humoral and cell-mediated immunity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of the innate immune system&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-humoral-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The humoral immune response&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Innate immunity is immediate and rapid. Innate defense mechanisms include neutrophils and macrophages, which, among other functions, can ingest and destroy pathogens. While often effective in protecting the host, innate immunity is associated with damage to host tissue in the context of providing defense. It is also amnestic in that the inciting agent is not specifically recognized by a unique structure and there is no creation of a memory to that agent such that future responses are more efficient.</p><p>Adaptive immunity is slower in its response to threats, particularly upon first exposure to that organism (na&iuml;ve responses are slower than memory responses). However, it provides two main features that innate immunity lacks: specific antigen recognition and memory that allows rapid recall of original antigen exposure. Host defense is generally provided in two major arms of the adaptive response:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Humoral immunity, which relies upon the production of antibodies by B cells and plasma cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cell-mediated immunity, which involves the interactions of helper and cytotoxic T cells with various target cells</p><p/><p>Immune cells produce a variety of products that allow them to communicate with each other and orchestrate an explosive, yet self-limited attack. Cytokines, in particular, are potent glycoprotein mediators that have the following properties:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They signal between cells and coordinate the immune response (ie, they are the hormones of the immune system)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are delivered by cells either to the systemic circulation or to the local environment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They bind to high-affinity surface receptors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are also produced by nonimmune cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">NOMENCLATURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytokines are hormone-like proteins that enable immune cells to communicate and play an integral role in the initiation, perpetuation, and subsequent downregulation of the immune response. The nomenclature for cytokines is rather confusing for historical reasons, and it is useful to review the various names that have been used. The term &quot;<strong>lymphokine&quot;</strong> was coined to describe cytokines derived from lymphocytes, while <strong>monokines</strong> were produced by monocytes or macrophages. Unfortunately, these distinctions were quite artificial and rapidly broke down because some cytokines are produced by many cell types, including macrophages, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. Furthermore, some &quot;monokines&quot; are expressed by lymphocytes, and some &quot;lymphokines&quot; are made by monocytes. In order to eliminate this confusion, the general term &quot;<strong>cytokine&quot;</strong> was introduced to identify this class of mediators (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69910\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69910 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Another area of confusion arose from the fact that many cytokines were simultaneously discovered by more than one group based upon different biologic activities. Often, these laboratories then named the factors based upon their activities, resulting in a situation in which a single molecule might have several different names. As an example, interleukin-6 (IL-6) was originally identified as a factor that enhanced B cell antibody production, acted as a hybridoma growth factor (HGF), and functioned as a modulator of acute phase reactants. As a result, names like B cell-stimulating factor (BSF) or HGF could refer to the same molecule.</p><p>The term interleukin (or IL) has greatly improved the nomenclature. Once a factor has been sufficiently characterized, it receives an interleukin designation (such as IL-2 or IL-6). It is clear, however, that even this can be misleading since cells besides leukocytes are capable of producing interleukins.</p><p>Despite the introduction of these general designations, some cytokines are still denoted by their descriptive names. For instance, colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) were originally described as proteins that stimulate the growth and differentiation of bone marrow precursors into mature hematopoietic or myeloid cells. We now know that CSFs also have potent immunoregulatory functions and can activate macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells. Similarly, interferons (IFNs; alpha, beta, and gamma), tumor necrosis factor (TNF; alpha and beta), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF; acidic and basic), and many molecules have not received an IL designation, even though their descriptive names usually represent only one of many activities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CYTOKINE INTERACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cells can communicate with one another by either direct contact or through the secretion of soluble mediators. Direct cell-cell contact regulates immune function of adjacent cells by a variety of mechanisms, including membrane-bound cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). In contrast, release of soluble mediators into the environment permits cells to exert influence at a distant site within the tissue. In some cases, cytokines can even reach distant cells in other organs via the peripheral circulation. For instance, interleukin-6 (IL-6) produced at a local inflammatory site can enhance liver acute phase protein production. Soluble cytokines bind to a specific receptor on the surface of target cells and transduce a signal that alters cellular function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CYTOKINE MEASUREMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytokines are most commonly measured in their soluble form, but they can also be measured in the tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Soluble cytokine assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytokine interactions that are mediated by direct contact are difficult to quantify. As a result, this aspect of cytokine biology has not been studied extensively in vivo. In contrast, soluble cytokines have been measured in various body fluids and tissues, and these measurements provide a window into the pathogenesis of the inflammatory process. Determinations of soluble cytokine levels typically use two types of assays: biologic and immunologic assays (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F56208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56208 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Biologic assay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The biologic assay is often the most sensitive test for a particular cytokine. This type of assay generally involves examining the effect of a test sample on a cell line. Proliferation, antibody production, or changes in the surface phenotype are examples of responses that can be measured after a cell has been exposed to a cytokine. Despite their sensitivity, bioassays often suffer from a lack of specificity and can be difficult to perform. As an example, biologic assays designed to measure proliferation of a particular cell line in response to one cytokine might also proliferate in response to a different cytokine. Also, inhibitors of cytokine activity, such as prostaglandins, soluble receptors, or natural antagonists, can also interfere with these assays. As a result, biologic assays are of limited utility when studying complex biologic samples containing a mixture of biologically active entities of similar function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunoassay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytokine concentrations can also be determined using immunoassays, which employ antibodies to capture and detect a specific cytokine. There are many techniques that can be used, but the most common method is the &quot;sandwich&quot; assay (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]). In this system, a sample is added to a microtiter well that has been coated with an antibody. The antibody binds the cytokine, and a second anticytokine antibody that is linked to an indicator is subsequently added. The amount of the second antibody that binds to the &quot;captured&quot; protein is proportional to the concentration of the cytokine in the original sample. The absolute amount of cytokine can then be calculated using a standard curve derived by adding known amounts of recombinant cytokine. This method has been considerably advanced by attaching capture antibodies to beads that are detectable by fluorescent-activated cell sorters and therefore amenable to the measurement of multiple cytokines within small samples (eg, approximately 20 cytokines can be measured in 50 microliters). This modification is termed &quot;multiplex analysis.&quot; Increasing technologic developments allow ever larger numbers of simultaneous assays for cytokines.</p><p>Immunoassays are often simpler and more reproducible than biologic assays, although antibody cross-reactivity can lead to false-positive results. In addition, false positives or negatives can be caused by rheumatoid factors, especially in autoimmune diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Artifacts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other artifacts can interfere with cytokine assays of biologic fluids. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytokines can be degraded by proteases or absorbed by receptors on activated cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soluble receptors in the sample that bind cytokines can interfere with biologic activity or block epitopes recognized by antibodies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytokines can also be absorbed by matrix proteins, such as glycosaminoglycans, and thereby be undetected using standard assays</p><p/><p>Because of these problems, cytokine assays of complex fluids (such as synovial effusions) should always be interpreted with caution. These issues have also led many investigators to analyze cytokine expression at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level, which can be more reliable, but is arduous. An additional caveat is that protein and mRNA production do not always correlate. A full understanding of the cytokine profile typically requires the use of multiple different assay systems to avoid these pitfalls. In parallel, other protein-based and proteomic approaches are being increasingly employed. As an example, cytokines may now be detected using Western blotting, although this technique is not yet quantitative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Localizing cytokines in tissues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best method for localizing cytokines in tissues is examining the protein level by immunohistochemistry. Specific antibodies bind to cytokines in permeabilized tissue sections. Bound antibody is detected using a second antibody that recognizes the first antibody (ie, secondary anti-immunoglobulin [Ig] antibody). The second antibody is most often directly labeled with a fluorescent chemical (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> isothiocyanate [FITC]) to allow detection and localization by immune fluorescent microscopy. Using a variety of antibodies and fluorescent colors allows double and even triple staining of cells to co-localize cellular expression of cytokines in vivo.</p><p>Alternatively, the secondary antibody may be bound to a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biotin-vitamin-h-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">biotin</a> molecule, which allows an additional layer of detection using streptavidin-FITC or streptavidin-enzyme (eg, alkaline phosphatase). The choice of enzyme allows addition of a further substrate, which changes color upon exposure to the enzyme. This color change can be localized on a tissue by light microscopy.</p><p>Cytokines can also be quantified at the mRNA level. RNA can be purified from tissue biopsies and assayed by traditional reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), in which results are obtained at the end of the reaction, or real-time PCR, which measures kinetics of the PCR reaction in the early phases. Localization in tissue may also be performed using in situ hybridization, which detects the presence of the cytokine mRNA in tissue using an anti-sense sequence of nucleotides that are labeled to allow detection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CYTOKINES IN NORMAL IMMUNITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detailed description of the role of cytokines in normal immunity is beyond the scope of this topic review. A brief summary of this subject is needed, however, in order to understand how cytokines or their antagonists ultimately might be used in clinical situations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T helper subsets: Differentiation and role in disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-humoral-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The humoral immune response&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Antigen presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antigen presentation is initiated when an antigen is recognized and processed by an antigen presenting cell (APC). The most potent APCs are macrophages and dendritic cells, but a diverse collection of cells possess this capacity, including B cells and Langerhans cells. Antigen processing is a carefully orchestrated series of events that involves antigen internalization, degradation into small polypeptides, and then re-expression of the peptide on the surface of the cell bound to major histocompatibility proteins, such as human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR. The antigen can then be presented to T cells that express the appropriate T cell receptor for the specific antigen.</p><p>The T <span class=\"nowrap\">cell/APC</span> complex also involves a number of accessory molecules (the cluster of differentiation [CD] cell surface molecules CD4 or CD8, CD3, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [ICAM-1]) and costimulatory proteins (eg, B7 [CD80 and CD86] and CD28, inducible T cell costimulatory [ICOS], programmed cell death 1 [PD-1]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78712\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78712 \">figure 1</a>). These molecules serve to stabilize interactions between the two cells and enhance or suppress subsequent T cell activation.</p><p>The ensuing stimulation of T cells by antigen and APCs depends upon the elaboration of cytokines. The precise cytokines elaborated have a critical influence on the nature of the subsequent T cell response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">T cell subsets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cytokine profile subsequently produced depends upon the type of antigen, the local cytokine milieu, and the prevalence of specific T cell subsets. Distinct helper T cell subsets have been identified (especially in mice) by virtue of cytokines that they produce. These subsets appear to modulate specific aspects of immunity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78712\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78712 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Th1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T helper 1 (Th1) cells produce interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin (IL)-2, but not IL-4. Th1 cells regulate delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. Th1 responses are promoted by local release of the IL-12 superfamily of cytokines including IL-27, IL-23, and IL-12. IL-12 may favor IFN-gamma release whereas IL-23 may favor IL-17 release. These responses are further enhanced by IL-15 and IL-18 production by dendritic cells and macrophages.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Th2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Th2 cells produce IL-4 and IL-10, but not IL-2 or IFN-gamma. Th2 cells mediate allergic and antibody responses. Th2 responses are favored by local production of IL-4, IL-33, and IL-18 in synergy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Th17</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Th17 cells are characterized by the production of IL-17A, together with a variety of other cytokines (IL-17F, IL-22, IL-26) and chemokines (CCL20). These cytokines are induced in the presence of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-21, and cells are thereafter expanded by IL-23. To date, six isoforms, A to F, have been identified in the IL-17 family. IL-17A and IL-17F are expressed in activated Th17 cells and are upregulated during inflammatory processes. Th17 cells may play a role in a number of inflammatory diseases previously thought to be Th1 mediated. There is increasing evidence that the IL-17 family members all operate through use of a common receptor IL-17RA. This has therapeutic utility as antibodies against this receptor component will allow targeted inhibition of a variety of members of the family, whereas antibodies directed against IL-17A will leave other family members untouched [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Some cytokines, such as IL-3, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), are produced by multiple Th subsets.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Th0</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Th0 cells have an unrestricted cytokine profile.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Regulatory T cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T regulatory (Treg) cells are a population of T cells with suppressive properties. Their cytokine dependence is unclear at this time. They are characterized by release of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and IL-10, and also IL-35, a novel member of the IL-12 superfamily. Their effector function is often dependent upon cell contact-mediated cellular suppression.</p><p>Aberrant immune responses in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and asthma could be due, in part, to overactivity of Th1 or Th2 cells, respectively. Th17 cells probably also play a role in various inflammatory diseases, with clinical intervention studies particularly suggesting a role in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Ongoing studies will help define the wider functional activities of Th17 cells. The predominance of one T cell subset over another is determined by the cytokine milieu. As examples, the presence of IFN-gamma or IL-12 favors Th1 development while IL-10 and IL-4 promote Th2 cell dominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Cells also offer reciprocal regulation (eg, IFN-gamma will suppress the activation of Th17 cells).</p><p>In humans, T cells do not appear to segregate quite as cleanly into these subsets, and there are many other cytokine combinations that have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, general patterns of Th1, Th2, Th17, and Th0 cells have been identified and probably play a role in the human immune response, including the susceptibility to develop autoimmune disease or various forms of T cell and B cell lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The capacity of T cells to elaborate a variable cytokine profile is termed T cell plasticity and is recognized in many human autoimmune diseases. The most pathogenic Th17 cells, for example, appear to be IL-17 and GM-CSF producers, whereas homeostatic Th17 cells release IL-17 and IL-10.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Amplification effects of cytokines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The predominant cytokine or cytokines further amplifies the response through positive feedback loops. Activities can include recruitment of inflammatory cells, inhibition of cell migration, enhancement of T cell proliferation, enhancement of antigen expression, and stimulation of T cells or B cells.</p><p>In general, Th1 responses result in cellular immune responses with localizing features (eg, formation of granulomata in tuberculous infection). The key effector cytokine is IFN-gamma, which promotes widespread leukocyte activation and organization together with activation of cytotoxic and phagocytic function.</p><p>In contrast, Th2 responses lead to enhanced humoral immunity with antibody release; this is optimal for antiviral responses and for defense against rapidly disseminated bacteria and parasites, or parasites in which mucosal immunity may be predominant. In Th2 dominant responses, IL-4 serves as the major T cell mitogen instead of IL-2 and suppresses differentiation of Th1 cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. IL-13, which is very similar to IL-4 (their surface receptors share a common alpha subunit), can stimulate other Th2 cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. IFN-gamma production is minimal, and Th1 activation is also suppressed by macrophage and Th2 cell-derived IL-10. IL-5 is a further effector cytokine of Th2 responses. Activated CD4+ T cells interact with B cells, either directly or through soluble mediators like IL-2 or IL-4, and induce them to proliferate and differentiate into plasma cells that synthesize antibodies. Specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) subsets and immunoglobulin E (IgE) are predominant in Th2-mediated responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The role of Th17 cells in host defense is unclear, although some infectious processes seem dependent upon their activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These cells may be involved in the early response to extracellular bacteria and fungi. IL-21 amplifies Th17 proliferation. Further data are required to elucidate the role of Th17 in the immune response to pathogens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Cellular migration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The migration of immune cells is accomplished by a highly redundant family of cytokines known as <strong>chemokines</strong>. These factors, which are classified by their amino acid sequence and their inflammatory and immune regulatory homeostatic roles, bind to specific surface receptors that induce cells to migrate into tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Up to 40 chemokines are now described, and their roles are very broad including not only induction of cellular migration, but also local cellular activation and survival. They also have a role in the homeostatic regulation of immune cells. They are of increasing interest because their modulation in a variety of disease models suggests that they may represent therapeutic targets. Moreover, their receptor structure predicts that small-molecule inhibitors may be relatively easily generated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Negative feedback</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to positive feedback loops involving cytokines, many negative feedback signals downregulate the immune system. This prevents an inflammatory response from overwhelming and harming the host. A number of cytokines and small-molecule mediators can dampen the immune response.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prostaglandins (such as prostaglandin E2) produced by macrophages can inhibit a variety of functions, including the induction of HLA-DR on macrophages and the production of IFN-gamma by T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TGF-beta is a potent suppressor of T cell activation and can decrease T cell proliferation and cytokine production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. It also decreases the number of IL-1 receptors, thereby making cells less sensitive to other cytokines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IL-10 deactivates macrophages, which in turn decreases production of cytokines by T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IL-35 inhibits the amplification of Th17 cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>These control mechanisms are critical elements for keeping the inflammatory response in check and maintaining homeostasis. Their importance can be demonstrated in animals that lack some of these elements. As an example, rodents that lack the TGF-beta gene have a generalized inflammatory disease due to the absence of its suppressive influence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This observation illustrates that cytokines are as important to the termination of the immune response as they are to its initiation. Their relationship to the role of Tregs is not entirely clear. The identification of the cytokines that regulate the production of regulatory T cells, both induced and native, will be of considerable importance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects beyond the immune system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A final area of developing interest resides in the recognition that cytokines interact with other physiologic systems including, for example, regulation of adipose tissue eg, via IL-6, adiponectin, resistin, leptin, or of hypothalamic pituitary function via IL-6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15281035\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytokines are hormone-like proteins that enable immune cells to communicate.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Cytokine interactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytokines are most commonly measured in their soluble form, but they can also be measured in the tissue (usually by enzymatic release-based techniques) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F56208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56208 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antigen presentation is initiated when an antigen is recognized and processed by an antigen presenting cell (APC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78712\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78712 \">figure 1</a>). The most potent APCs are macrophages and dendritic cells, but a diverse collection of cells possess this capacity, including B cells and Langerhans cells. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Antigen presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD4+ T helper (Th) cells can be categorized by the profile of cytokines that they produce (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78712\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78712 \">figure 1</a>). These subsets include Th0, Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, and regulatory T cells. In general, Th1 responses result in cellular immune responses with localizing features. In contrast, Th2 responses lead to enhanced humoral immunity with antibody release. Th17 responses are increasingly recognized to play a role in a variety of autoimmune responses but also to play a role in mucosal defence. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'T cell subsets'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Amplification effects of cytokines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an archetypal response, a predominant cytokine(s) amplifies the immune response through positive feedback loops. There are also negative feedback loops that downregulate the immune system. Normally, a given cytokine initiates an effector and a regulatory response to anticipate restoration of immune homeostasis. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Amplification effects of cytokines'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Negative feedback'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemokines bind to specific surface receptors that induce cells to migrate into tissues. They may also promote activation or other regulatory effects on target cells upon receptor binding. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Cellular migration'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Mosmann TR, Cherwinski H, Bond MW, et al.
