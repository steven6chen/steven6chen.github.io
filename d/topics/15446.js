Effective strategies for cervical cancer screening and treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, a precursor to cancer, have been in place for more than 70 years and, where applied, have dramatically reduced the incidence of and mortality from this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>However, standard strategies such as cervical cytology, human papillomavirus testing, and colposcopy are often not possible in developing settings due to economic and other infrastructure issues. Health care resources and disease burden vary between and within countries, making it difficult to draw general conclusions regarding screening strategies for the entire developing world. Addressing individual countries is beyond the scope of this topic review. Therefore, cervical cancer screening in health care systems in which cytology or colposcopy are not feasible will be reviewed here.</p><p>The general approach to and tests used for cervical cancer screening are discussed separately.

Over 85 percent of new cases are diagnosed in the developing world, and in these countries, it is the most common cancer in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The challenges facing health care systems worldwide are illustrated by the following: In 2002, there were 510,000 deaths (0.9 percent of the total deaths) attributed to maternal conditions and 2,464,000 deaths (4.3 percent of total deaths) due to perinatal conditions worldwide. Although cervical cancer is prevalent, it caused fewer deaths (239,000 deaths; 0.4 percent of total deaths) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. HIV infection is particularly important, since it is not only a competing health priority in some regions, but also exacerbates cervical neoplasia. In addition, with the scarcity of health care resources, existing health care services tend to focus on curative, rather than preventive, health care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-hiv-infected-women-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for cervical cancer in HIV-infected women and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Economic factors also present an obstacle to screening. Developing countries account for 84 percent of the global population, 90 percent of the disease burden, 20 percent of gross domestic product, but only 12 percent of health spending [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The disparity in per capita expenditure on health in developed versus developing countries is stark. Yearly per capita expenditure on health in the United States in 2006 was $5711, $3809 in Switzerland, and $2389 in the United Kingdom. By contrast, in developing countries, annual per capita expenditures ranged from $14 in the Democratic Republic of Congo to $64 in Nepal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Standard cervical cancer screening methods, such as cytology or colposcopy, are costly and are not affordable considering the per capita expenditure on health in these countries.</p><p>Social and political conditions in low-resource settings often impede cervical cancer screening programs. Reliable and affordable modes of communication and transportation are often lacking. Therefore, women are often not able to travel to a screening site for an initial or follow-up visit or to receive results in a timely manner. Education and literacy also make an impact. Women in poor countries may be illiterate or may use a local dialect that differs from the national language. Thus, they may not be able to read written results. Also, women are likely to be uninformed about interventions such as cervical cancer screening, and thus there is no public demand and no political motivation to establish screening programs. War and civil strife are endemic in many poor countries and are another factor that may have devastating consequences for health care infrastructure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In countries that have introduced successful cervical cancer screening programs, cervical cancer has become a relatively rare disease. In most developed countries, the Age Standardized Incidence Rate (ASIR) for cervical cancer is less than <span class=\"nowrap\">10/100,000,</span> whereas in developing countries, the ASIR of cervical cancer ranges from 25 to <span class=\"nowrap\">55/100,000</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Cytologic screening with or without human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing has led to vast improvements in prevention and early detection of cervical cancer. Evidence of the effectiveness of this approach has led to the adoption of cervical cytology screening in all developed and some developing nations. The standard approach to cervical cancer screening in developed settings is to use cytology, typically in some combination with HPV testing, follow with colposcopy, and then treatment based on the results of colposcopic diagnosis. This approach requires three visits with communication of test results after each step.</p><p>Unfortunately, due to the barriers discussed in the preceding section, the success of the approach used in developed countries has not been replicated in developing countries. Cytology-based screening programs require a relatively sophisticated and costly infrastructure, including highly trained personnel, built-in quality control, ongoing training of staff, adequately equipped laboratories, and functional referral systems to communicate results of the test to women. HPV testing is costly, laboratory-based, and when used as a triage test, adds an extra processing step to cervical cytology. Women, in turn, need to be able to return for further testing if indicated. Additionally, colposcopy requires a level of clinical expertise typically found only in tertiary health care facilities, if available at all, and histology requires a laboratory infrastructure and trained pathologists, all of which are in short supply in poor countries.</p><p>One study estimated that 63 percent of women in developed countries receive cervical cancer screening, with an upper range of 80 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The comparative figure in developing countries is 19 percent, ranging from 1 percent in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Myanmar to 73 percent in Brazil.</p><p>HPV vaccines, another approach for cervical cancer prevention, are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Creating a functional cervical cancer screening program in a low-resource setting must include consideration of the screening test and its characteristics and also address the limitation of health care access and infrastructure. Ideal characteristics of a cervical cancer screening test used in such settings include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can be performed in a primary health care facility</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can be performed by trained nurses or paramedical staff, particularly where there are few or no clinicians</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Requires little technology and staff training to perform, process, and interpret</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Test result should be either immediate (eg, visual screening methods such as visual inspection with acetic acid [VIA]) or be available within several hours or days (eg, rapid result HPV testing)</p><p/><p>Performing screening and treatment at the same visit, thereby eliminating the intermediate steps of colposcopy and histological sampling, is another strategy that can avoid patient noncompliance with follow-up and reduce infrastructure requirements, and therefore the overall costs of cervical cancer prevention. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Screen and treat protocols'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening frequency and patient age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women in developed countries are often screened for cervical cancer every one to three years. However, this screening frequency is not possible in most low-resource settings. Decisions regarding screening frequency must be made based upon available resources. In programs in which women will receive screening only once or twice in a lifetime, screening should focus on the age range that will result in the largest reduction in cervical cancer incidence and mortality.</p><p>The greatest impact on cervical cancer reduction appears to result from screening women aged 30 to 39 years. This is supported by a subgroup analysis from a randomized trial in which over 80,000 women aged 30 to 59 in India were assigned to either VIA screening or cervical cancer health education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. At seven-year follow-up, women in the screening group showed a significant decrease in age-standardized rates of cervical cancer incidence (25 percent) and mortality (35 percent); these decreases were greater in women aged 30 to 39 (incidence: 38 percent and mortality: 66 percent) compared with other age ranges (40 to 49 years: 18 and 45 percent; 50 to 59 years: 24 and 1 percent).</p><p>Optimal screening frequency and patient age have also been calculated using modeling studies, since longitudinal clinical data are not available. One such modeling study used clinical data from India, Thailand, Kenya, South Africa, and Peru to evaluate cervical cancer screening in women once in a lifetime at the age of 35 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Within these parameters, screening with VIA or HPV testing would reduce the lifetime risk of cervical cancer by 25 to 36 percent and cost less than US $500 per year of life saved. Costs of the various protocols varied from country to country.</p><p>By contrast, using cytology as the screening method in the United States, one study estimated that, compared with no screening, screening every three years costs $22,000 per year of life gained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Increasing the frequency of screening to every two years would cost $440,000 for every additional year of life gained, whereas annual screening would cost $1.8 million for each additional year.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Challenges to evaluating screening tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determination of the performance of a screening test depends on the reference standard used. The gold standard typically used for cervical cancer screening tests is colposcopic-directed biopsy (biopsy of areas with suspicious colposcopic findings). Use of this standard tends to overestimate sensitivity, since false-negative colposcopy will result in missing some cervical neoplasia. Few studies use random cervical biopsies as the reference standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">VISUAL INSPECTION METHODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, visual inspection of the cervix without magnification was the first method of screening of the cervix. It was introduced in the 1930s by Schiller, who used Lugol's iodine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. It was, however, soon realized that this method of screening had a low specificity, and Schiller's test, as it was known, was rapidly replaced when cervical cytology became available.</p><p>In contrast with colposcopy, visual inspection of the cervix is performed using the naked eye. Visual inspection is also referred to as direct visual inspection or cervicoscopy. This technique has reemerged as a screening tool for low-resource settings because, despite its limited specificity, it is economical, requires little equipment, and provides immediate results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Visual inspection can be performed with acetic acid or Lugol's iodine (VILI).</p><p>Primary care clinicians or midlevel providers can be trained to perform visual inspection within a relatively short period of time; however, due to the subjective nature of the test, it is difficult to standardize quality control. The technique for performing these tests is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-screening-tests-visual-inspection-methods\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical cancer screening tests: Visual inspection methods&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Visual inspection with acetic acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) screening followed by treatment reduces the rate of cervical cancer compared with no screening. This was illustrated by two large randomized trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one trial, clinics serving over 80,000 women aged 30 to 59 years in India were assigned to either VIA screening or cervical cancer health education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Women with positive screening tests were further evaluated with colposcopy and directed biopsy, and those with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) were treated with cryotherapy or excision. At seven-year follow-up, women in the screening group versus the health education group showed a significant decrease in age-standardized rates of cervical cancer incidence (75 versus 99 per 100,000 person-years) and mortality (40 versus 57 per 100,000 person-years).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, another trial included over 150,000 women aged 35 to 64 years in India who were assigned to either VIA screening or cancer education, performed by public health workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The incidence of invasive cervical cancer was 26.74 per 100,000 in the screening group and 27.49 per 100,000 in the control group. At 12-year follow-up, the screening group showed a 31 percent reduction in cervical cancer mortality. A 7 percent reduction was also observed in all-cause mortality.</p><p/><p>The sensitivity and specificity of VIA in developing countries for detection of CIN or cervical cancer has been evaluated in multiple observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/17,19-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19-28</a>]. The highest quality data are reported in a meta-analysis of 11 studies with over 58,000 women aged 25 to 64 years in India and Africa. Each woman underwent VIA and one or more other screening tests; the reference standard was colposcopic-directed biopsy performed in all women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. For detection of CIN 2 or a more severe abnormality (CIN2+), VIA had a sensitivity and specificity of 79 and 85 percent, respectively.</p><p>The World Health Organization published the results of a demonstration project from 2005 to 2009 to use VIA screening in 19,759 women in six African countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. VIA was positive in 10.1 percent of patients, and 87.7 percent of VIA-positive cases were eligible for cryotherapy.</p><p>Thirty-nine percent of women accepted treatment on the same day, but there was high loss to follow-up for women diagnosed with high-grade precursors and cervical cancer. A total of 326 women had a &ldquo;suspicious for cancer&rdquo; diagnosis; only 77 out of 96 investigated were finally treated, almost all with radiation, with the rest of the women lost to follow-up.</p><p>At best, VIA screening offers an interim approach to establish a screening culture and infrastructure in low-resource settings until an affordable human papillomavirus (HPV) test can be introduced. Inherent in any screening strategy are the tradeoffs between the characteristics of the test (ie, sensitivity to maximize precursors detected and specificity to minimize overtreatment) and programmatic issues such as population coverage and the necessary diagnostic and treatment procedures, costs, and quality control. </p><p>An aspect of the single-visit approach that has not been well evaluated is the impact of point-of-care testing at a primary care level. The single-visit approach does not obviate the need for counseling or careful explanation for follow-up and requires additional work on already overloaded health care workers and fragile health systems. Careful evaluation and planning are needed to plan how to integrate this approach with other interventions for women&rsquo;s and general health.</p><p>Coexisting vaginal or cervical infection with Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, or Neisseria gonorrhoeae did not alter the sensitivity or specificity of VIA for CIN2+ in a cross-sectional study of 2754 women in South Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, there was a significant decrease in VIA specificity in women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">VIA with magnification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The addition of magnification to VIA (VIAM) does not improve the detection of CIN or cervical cancer over VIA with the naked eye. This was best illustrated by a meta-analysis of three studies that included over 18,000 women aged 25 to 65 years who were evaluated with both VIA and VIAM; colposcopy with directed cervical biopsy was used as the reference standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. For detection of CIN2+, there were no significant differences in the sensitivity and specificity for VIA (60 and 87 percent) versus VIAM (64 and 87 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Visual inspection with Lugol's iodine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VILI is more sensitive than VIA, but equally specific. It is, however, used less commonly than VIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/28,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,31</a>]. In our experience, VIA allows a more nuanced and more detailed analysis of the dysplastic area. In the meta-analysis of 11 studies described in a preceding section, women were evaluated with both VIA and VILI in 10 studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. For detection of CIN 2+, the sensitivity and specificity for VILI were 91 and 85 percent (compared with 79 and 85 percent for VIA). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Visual inspection with acetic acid'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">HPV TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing used alone or in combination with VIA has the potential to improve cervical cancer screening in low-resource settings. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to use the current HPV tests used in developed countries due to expense, the infrastructure required for processing, and waiting time for results, although new HPV tests, capable of giving a result within an hour, are currently being developed and tested.</p><p>Advances in HPV testing technology are under investigation with the goal of addressing these obstacles. As an example, a point-of-care HPV test (Xpert HPV) has been developed. The test identifies all high-risk HPV types as well as determining the presence of HPV 16 and other combinations of high-risk genotypes. The test gives a result within one hour and is uniquely positioned to provide screening and treating in one visit without the complexity of a laboratory-based test. The manufacturer has implemented point-of-care tuberculosis testing using similar technology (GeneXpert) in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>This section will focus on the clinical utility of HPV DNA testing in low-resource settings. The general use of HPV DNA testing for cervical cancer screening is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-cervical-cancer#H3223948\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for cervical cancer&quot;, section on 'HPV testing'</a>.)</p><p>HPV testing reduces cervical cancer mortality in developing settings and is superior to visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) or cervical cytology. This was illustrated in a randomized trial of 131,746 women aged 30 to 59 years in rural India that compared a single lifetime screening with one of three screening modalities with standard care; the screening modalities were: HPV testing using the Hybrid Capture II test (HC2), cervical cytology, or VIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. At eight-year follow-up, women who received HPV testing versus standard care had a 50 percent reduction in stage II or higher cervical cancer (15 versus 33 per 100,000 person-years) and cervical cancer mortality (13 versus 26 per 100,000 person-years). For the groups screened by cytology or VIA, rates of stage II or higher cervical cancer (VIA: 32 per 100,000 person-years; cytology: 23 per 100,000 person-years) or cervical cancer mortality (VIA: 21 per 100,000 person-years; cytology: 21 per 100,000 person-years) did not differ significantly compared with standard care, but were significantly higher than women in the HPV testing group. This result for VIA differed from the finding of the trial in 80,000 women described above; the authors attributed this difference to a higher rate of treatment in that trial. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Visual inspection with acetic acid'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Rapid result HPV test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While these results are promising, the HPV tests (eg, HC2) used in developed countries are prohibitively expensive for low-resource settings (in the United States the cost per test is approximately $50 to 100), and the waiting time for a result of one or more days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] is an additional impediment to patient follow-up. However, data are emerging regarding a new HPV test (careHPV) that is affordable, gives results quickly, and is portable. Each test will cost less than US $5, the processing kit has its own reagents and water supply and can be run using batteries, and the result is available within 2.5 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The new test detects 14 high-risk types of HPV, similar to the 14 or 18 types detected by the tests used in developed countries. This test is not yet commercially available.</p><p>The rapid result HPV test appears to perform as well for the detection of high-grade cervical neoplasia as standard HPV testing, and to be superior to VIA. The single study that has evaluated the rapid result test was a cross-sectional study of 2388 women in China aged 30 to 54 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Each woman was assessed using a self-collected vaginal specimen (for careHPV testing), VIA, and a provider-collected cervical specimen (for careHPV, HC2, and cervical cytology); colposcopic-directed biopsy was performed in all women and used as the reference standard. HC2 testing showed no significant difference in detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+) versus provider-collected careHPV, but was superior to self-collected careHPV (sensitivity and specificity, HC2: 97 and 86 percent, provider-careHPV: 90 and 84 percent; self-careHPV: 81 and 82 percent). On the other hand, VIA was inferior to either a provider-collected or self-collected careHPV for detecting CIN2+ (sensitivity and specificity, VIA: 41 and 95 percent). Direct comparison of collection method for careHPV revealed no significant difference in CIN2+ detection between provider- and self-collected samples.</p><p>These data are promising and indicate that rapid result HPV testing may be suitable for performing screening and treatment on the same day in low-resource settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Increasing HPV test specificity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HPV testing has a high sensitivity, but a low specificity. Specificity takes on added importance in low-resource settings whether follow-up for a positive test is further evaluated or immediately treated. Additional costs are incurred when women with false-positive screening tests are referred for a costly test like colposcopy. Also, where treatment is performed based on a screening test, low test specificity may result in large numbers of women being treated unnecessarily.</p><p>One approach to the low specificity of HPV testing is to change the definition of a positive test. In the case of HPV testing, the definition of a positive test can be varied by changing the positivity threshold (expressed as the ratio of light emission, ie, relative light units [RLU] per positive control specimen [PC]). As for most tests, increasing the specificity results in a decrease in sensitivity. This was illustrated in a study of over 2900 women in South Africa in which detection of CIN2+ by HC2 at a threshold of &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">RLU/PC</span> (the typical standard) had a sensitivity of 88 percent and specificity of 82 percent, while a threshold of &gt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">RLU/PC</span> had a sensitivity of 79 percent and specificity of 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Self-collected samples</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women who do not have access to a speculum examination or who are reluctant to undergo a pelvic examination, self-collected vaginal samples can be used for HPV testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Women can collect samples from the vagina using a tampon, Dacron or cotton swab, cytobrush, or cervicovaginal lavage. Self-collection can be performed under supervision at a clinic or at home. If a woman collects a sample at home, it is then placed in a collection tube with a transport medium and brought back to the clinic for processing.</p><p>Self-collected samples were compared with clinician-collected samples in a meta-analysis of 18 studies with 5441 women in which women collected vaginal samples for HPV testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The analysis found a high concordance (0.87) between results of self- and clinician-collected samples. Studies that evaluated acceptability reported that women preferred self-collection versus clinician sampling. A limitation of this analysis was that many of the included studies were conducted among a referral population of women with known or suspected cervical disease; therefore, a high HPV prevalence may impact the results.</p><p>Further study is needed to determine the best method of self-collection (eg, swab, cervical brush, tampon). This question was addressed in an earlier meta-analysis, which included 12 of the same studies as the analysis described above and used clinician-collected HPV samples as a reference standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. For seven studies that used a Dacron or cotton swab or a cytobrush, the pooled sensitivity and specificity for HPV detection was 78 and 90 percent. For three studies in which a tampon was used, the results are reported as a range of sensitivities (67 to 94 percent) and specificities (80 to 100 percent). These data do not allow comparison among the methods.</p><p>Self-collected HPV testing (with a cervical brush) was compared with cervical cytology performed at a clinic in a randomized trial of 12,330 women in Mexico [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The acceptability of self-collected HPV testing was high; 98 percent of women in the HPV testing group agreed to collect the sample and performed the testing, while 89 percent of those scheduled for a Pap test had the test performed. HPV testing had a higher sensitivity for detection of CIN2+ (relative sensitivity 2.9, 95% CI 2.0-4.1) and for invasive cancer (3.6, 95% CI 1.6-7.9). The disadvantage of HPV testing was that more women underwent colposcopy and ultimately had negative findings: 28 percent in the HPV testing group compared with none in the cytology group. For CIN2+, the positive predictive value of HPV testing was 12.2 percent compared with 90.5 percent for cytology.</p><p>Given these data, self-collection appears to be a useful method for HPV testing in women who do not have access to a speculum examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">COMBINING TWO SCREENING TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combining two screening tests (eg, visual inspection with acetic acid [VIA] and human papillomavirus [HPV] testing) is one approach to balancing the strengths and weaknesses of each test. Two-test strategies can be either: additive, with screen-positive defined as an abnormal result on either test; or sequential, in which only women with an abnormal result on the first test undergo a second test, and only those who are also positive on the second test would receive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The goal is to maximize screening performance by combining a test with high sensitivity (eg, VIA) with another test with high specificity (eg, HPV testing with use of a high threshold for positivity). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Increasing HPV test specificity'</a> above.)</p><p>Use of a two-test approach to screening increased specificity, but decreased sensitivity in a prospective observational study of 1266 South African women aged 35 to 65 years. Each woman underwent screening with Hybrid Capture I HPV testing and VIA; VIA with magnification (VIAM), cervicography (a photograph of the cervix after application of acetic acid), and cytology were also performed. Women with abnormal results on any of the screening tests underwent colposcopy at a follow-up visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Based on study results, use of VIA or HPV alone would result in a missed diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+) in 6 or 8 per 1000 women screened, respectively, while 180 or 131 per 1000 would receive unnecessary treatment. Sequential use of VIA followed by HPV would result in a missed CIN2+ diagnosis in 13 per 1000 women screened, while 41 per 1000 would receive unnecessary treatment.</p><p>Given these results, it appears that it is preferable to use a combination of the two screening tests rather than either test alone. The number of missed diagnoses is notable, but does not outweigh the large decrease in the number of women who would receive unnecessary treatment. Complications are rare with cryotherapy, the predominant method of treatment for CIN used in developing settings. However, unnecessary treatment also incurs costs, which may reduce the number of total women who can be screened within a particular program. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Ablative therapies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREEN AND TREAT PROTOCOLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A screening test followed in the same visit by treatment of positive results is referred to as a &quot;screen and treat&quot; or &quot;see and treat&quot; protocol. This approach is only possible with screening tests that produce immediate results (eg, visual inspection, rapid result human papillomavirus [HPV] testing). </p><p>One-visit protocols eliminate communication difficulties involved in delivering and interpreting written results for patients as well as the issue of noncompliance with follow-up, in contrast to protocols that require two visits (screening followed by treatment) or three visits (screening followed by colposcopy followed by treatment). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3451177054\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment method</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment method used in most low-resource settings is cryotherapy rather than loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) or cold knife conization. Cryotherapy is generally easier and cheaper to perform at a primary care level. A hand-held portable device is available for cryotherapy. Cryotherapy does not require local anesthetic and complications such as damage to contiguous organs are less likely. The World Health Organization (WHO) evaluated cryotherapy in a systematic review and recommended cryotherapy in settings where LEEP is not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Similarly, they recommended LEEP rather than cryotherapy in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive women. A major advantage of cryotherapy is that it can be performed by non-clinicians in a primary care setting, and it is also suitable for a &quot;screen and treat&quot; approach. This method of treating cervical cancer precursors is effective and may well make treating women in low-resource settings more accessible with much greater coverage of the target population. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1070081669\"><span class=\"h2\">One-visit protocols</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ability of screen and treat protocols, specifically with use of HPV testing, to reduce the rate of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or cancer was demonstrated in a randomized trial of 6555 previously unscreened women in South Africa, aged 35 to 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. All women were screened with visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), Hybrid Capture II (HC2) HPV testing, and cytology and were assigned to one of three groups: VIA screen-positive followed by cryotherapy, HPV screen-positive followed by cryotherapy, or no further evaluation or treatment for six months. All women also underwent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing. At six-month follow-up, colposcopy with directed biopsy was performed in all women and CIN2+ was found in significantly fewer women in both the VIA and HPV screen and treat groups (2.2 and 0.8 percent, respectively) versus the delayed group (3.6 percent). This difference persisted in a subset of 2708 women who were evaluated at 12 months, with a rate of CIN2+ for VIA and HPV versus the delayed group of 2.9 and 1.4 percent versus 5.4 percent. At 36 months, based on data from 3639 women, the cumulative rate of CIN2+ detection continued to be lower in the VIA and treat group (3.8 percent) and HPV and treat group (1.5 percent) than in the delayed group (5.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Treatment based on results of screening tests with low specificity, such as VIA or HPV testing, will result in some women receiving unnecessary treatment. However, cryotherapy, the preferred treatment in developing settings, has a low complication rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. In this trial, adverse effects reported by women who underwent cryotherapy included vaginal discharge (78 percent), abdominal pain (30 percent), and abnormal bleeding (14 percent); only one woman had bleeding that required hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Women who underwent cryotherapy had more unscheduled visits during the study period than those who did not (1.0 versus 0.5 percent).</p><p>This study is limited by the protocol used, since screening was followed two to six days later by treatment in the screen and treat groups, while a one-visit approach is generally an important component of screen and treat protocols. In fact, 82 women did not return after the initial screening visit.</p><p>In a World Health Organization demonstration project from 2005 to 2009 in 19,759 women in six African countries that included VIA screening followed by treatment with cryotherapy if positive, 39.1 percent of women were screened and treated on the same day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Cost-effectiveness is also more likely to be improved with one-visit screen and treat protocols than those requiring two or more visits. The data regarding cost derive from studies based on mathematical modeling rather than clinical studies. In one such report, based on a theoretical cohort of previously unscreened 30 year-old black South African women, a single visit in which screen-positive VIA or HPV testing is coupled with cryotherapy would be more cost-effective than two-visit protocols with HPV or cytology (lifetime cost per woman US $39 to 41 versus $42 to 44) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The World Health Organization has published guidelines for clinical settings regarding the screen and treat approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In general, in the guidelines, use of an HPV test as the screening test is preferred if feasible. If HPV testing is not available, VIA is advised rather than cervical cytology followed by colposcopy (with or without biopsy). HPV testing may be combined with VIA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91833\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef91833 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3701799917\"><span class=\"h2\">Two-visit protocols</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two-visit protocols typically include a first visit with cervical cytology followed by a second visit with colposcopy and treatment based on colposcopic impression. Overtreatment, defined as treatment of lesions that are actually low-grade, is an important concern, as with one-visit protocols.</p><p>It appears that the risk of overtreatment of CIN increases when there is a discrepancy between cervical cytology and colposcopic impression and with treatment in the presence of a low-grade colposcopic appearance. A meta-analysis was performed of 13 studies including 4611 women who were managed with a see and treat approach, cervical cytology, and then colposcopy and treatment (with a LEEP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-cervical-cancer-in-resource-limited-settings/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. This analysis is relevant mainly to high-resource settings, since it evaluated use of cervical cytology and colposcopy, which may not be available in low-resource settings, and LEEP is not the preferred treatment method in low-resource settings based on cost and risk of complications. The analysis found the following overtreatment rates for differing combinations of cytology and colposcopic impression: high-grade cytology and high-grade colposcopic impression (11.6 percent), high-grade and low-grade (29.3 percent), low-grade and high-grade (46.4 percent), and low-grade and low-grade (72.9 percent). The rate for women with both high-grade cytology and colposcopic impression is comparable to the overtreatment rate (11 to 35 percent) for a three-visit protocol (cytology, colposcopy and biopsy, then treatment). Thus, for women with a discrepancy between cervical cytology results and colposcopic impression, with a low-grade colposcopic impression, and who are able to comply with a three-visit protocol, biopsy and treatment only for a histologic result of cervical intraepithelial lesion 2 or 3 is prudent. This is particularly true for women who plan future pregnancy and when LEEP or cold knife cone is the treatment mode, since these may result in adverse obstetric outcomes.
