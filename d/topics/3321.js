Characteristic clinical features include retinal hemorrhages (often but not always bilateral, multilayered, and extensive), subdural hematoma, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> occult fractures (particularly of the ribs and long bone metaphyses). Multiple episodes of trauma may occur before the abuse is detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Early recognition can be lifesaving. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Epidemiology, mechanisms, and types of abusive head trauma in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Child abuse is an important cause of death in children. Among child abuse fatalities, head injury is the leading cause of death in infancy. Mortality rates in series of cases of AHT range from approximately 15 to 25 percent. The epidemiology and risk factors for physical abuse and abusive head trauma are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition#H1199045830\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Epidemiology, mechanisms, and types of abusive head trauma in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Children with AHT commonly have abnormal eye findings such as hemorrhages of the retina, vitreous, or optic nerve sheath (the latter visible only on autopsy) and perimacular retinal folding or retinoschisis (splitting of the retinal layers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. For example, in a systematic review of 20 observational studies with results of eye examination in 973 victims of abuse, intraocular hemorrhage (retinal or vitreous hemorrhage) was seen in approximately 85 percent of children with AHT. Thus, a careful funduscopic examination with indirect ophthalmoscopy by an ophthalmologist is indicated in all children in whom AHT is suspected. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Ophthalmology consultation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of AHT often requires a high index of suspicion. An accurate history is rarely provided at the time of presentation. The signs and symptoms can vary from mild and nonspecific to severe and immediately life-threatening. AHT should be suspected in infants who present with unexplained vomiting, poor feeding, lethargy, irritability, seizures, impaired consciousness, or apnea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Evaluation and diagnosis of abusive head trauma in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Nonophthalmologic aspects of the physical examination of the infant with inflicted head injury are discussed separately and often involve abnormal findings on examination of the skin, chest, and abdomen.

Poorly reactive pupils or a gaze preference may be noted. Periorbital ecchymoses, subconjunctival hemorrhage (especially in the absence of coughing or vomiting in infants over four weeks), hyphema, and orbital fractures may indicate direct trauma to the face or orbit, whereas funduscopic findings such as retinal hemorrhages may indicate occult intracranial injury. Late signs of severe direct injury on funduscopy may include optic atrophy, retinal detachment, retinal scars, and choroidal rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

Pharmacologic dilation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57408\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57408 \">table 1</a>) or pathologic dilation of the pupils facilitates detection of retinal hemorrhages and other abnormalities, as well as retinal photography. These benefits of pharmacologic dilation usually outweigh the loss of ability to monitor pupillary reaction for several hours. Dilating one eye at a time may be an alternative in situations where the ability to monitor pupillary reaction is necessary (eg, patients with signs of severe increased intracranial pressure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Even when the pupils cannot be pharmacologically dilated, an undilated examination by an ophthalmologist is worthwhile; it may provide a partial view of the fundus and identification of retinal hemorrhage patterns that may change quickly, due to the rapid clearance of intraretinal hemorrhages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Direct ophthalmoscopy</strong> &ndash; The handheld direct ophthalmoscope provides a magnified but limited view of the fundus: little more than 1 disc diameter can be visualized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71156\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71156 \">picture 1</a>). Extensive retinal hemorrhages in the posterior pole of the fundus in children with severe neurologic injury (and fixed dilated pupils) may be visualized, but more subtle findings in children with less severe injury may be missed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A newer type of handheld direct ophthalmoscope (the Pan Optic&trade; by Welch Allyn) increases the field of vision to 2 to 5 disc diameters and may increase the ability to detect retinal abnormalities with direct ophthalmoscopy; however, the view is still only two dimensional and not as wide as with an indirect ophthalmoscope. A formal study of the use of the Pan Optic scope for evaluating retinal findings in this context has not been reported.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Indirect ophthalmoscopy &ndash;</strong> The indirect ophthalmoscope, most often a head-mounted unit used with a hand-held lens, provides a wide-angle binocular view that simultaneously includes nearly all of the areas in the posterior pole of the fundus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71156\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71156 \">picture 1</a>). By directing the view toward different parts of the retina, much of the periphery can be seen. In an uncooperative child who is moving his or her eyes, the fundus image may flash past the viewer. The larger field of view provided by the indirect ophthalmoscope increases the likelihood that important features such as the optic nerve head or hemorrhages will come into view.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postmortem examination</strong> &ndash; Postmortem examination of the eyes can reveal signs of possible child abuse and should be performed in cases of suspected abuse or unexplained death in infants and young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Postmortem ocular examination supplements pre-mortem findings and should be performed even if the eyes were examined clinically before death. However, postmortem ophthalmoscopy is limited by corneal opacification.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pathologic examination of the eyes and orbital tissues, which necessitates removal at autopsy, is also recommended in these patients to assure that all abnormalities are identified, including optic nerve sheath hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Pathological examination is best performed by an ocular pathologist.</p><p/><p>Retinal findings, such as retinal hemorrhages, may be detected by any physician who is familiar with such hemorrhages and has experience with funduscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/13,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18-20</a>]. Clinicians other than ophthalmologists may also dilate the pupils to improve their view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57408\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57408 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>However, detection of intraocular abnormalities is optimized by ophthalmology consultation, which permits better evaluation of the entire retina with an indirect ophthalmoscope and dilation of the child's pupils. For example, in a retrospective series of 123 children admitted for subdural hematomas caused by abuse, physicians other than ophthalmologists failed to detect retinal hemorrhages in 29 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In another series, no attempt was made by clinicians other than ophthalmologists to visualize the retina in 36 percent of patients with AHT; among the children who were examined, hemorrhages were missed in 13 percent of the cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Furthermore, examination by a non-ophthalmologist may not sufficiently identify the patterns and details of retinal hemorrhages, which may have diagnostic implications. Thus, consultation with an ophthalmologist should occur for all children under five years of age with suspected AHT regardless of initial findings on funduscopic examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Ophthalmology consultation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consultation with an ophthalmologist for a complete dilated indirect ophthalmoscopic examination is recommended in all children younger than five years of age in whom AHT is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The examination should take place within 24 to 48 hours so that transient retinal changes are not missed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] &#160; The detection of retinal hemorrhages may be a crucial step in the identification of abuse and appropriate direction of additional evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

The ophthalmologist may be able to detect additional hemorrhages and characterize them in a fashion that permits better assessment of the likelihood that child abuse occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]. The ophthalmologist also can provide a more knowledgeable opinion regarding the etiology of the retinal findings and better photographic documentation (if available) of the hemorrhages for legal purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Occasionally, intracranial abnormalities, including subdural hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral edema, may be missed on initial computed tomography scans of the head or may not be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>]. In such cases, the detection of retinal hemorrhages is a strong indicator that AHT may still have occurred and prompt additional neuroimaging such as magnetic resonance imaging.</p><p>Observational studies suggest that the frequency of retinal hemorrhages is low in young children with normal neuroimaging and no evidence of head trauma upon physical examination. For example, among 78 infants with isolated long-bone fractures and dilated fundus examinations, none had retinal hemorrhages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, an eye examination by an ophthalmologist is not invasive, and if suspicion for abusive head trauma is high enough that a skeletal survey or neuroimaging is obtained, then an eye examination is warranted. Furthermore, in children who do not receive an eye examination by an ophthalmologist, determination that there are no significant findings of child abuse should only occur after consultation with a child abuse specialist.

The severity of the retinal abnormalities is also correlated with the severity of the intracranial abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Retinal hemorrhages in AHT usually are bilateral, although asymmetry and unilaterality are well recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/13,19,31,34,35,38,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,19,31,34,35,38,42</a>]. In a series of 75 children with AHT, there was no correlation between the laterality of intracranial findings (eg, extra-axial hemorrhage, edema) and the laterality of retinal findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], although a correlation was detected in a smaller series (14 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the majority of cases of AHT (approximately two-thirds), the hemorrhages are too numerous to count and extend anteriorly to the ora serrata (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59910\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59910 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, retinal hemorrhages associated with AHT can be few in number, exclusively intraretinal, and confined to the posterior pole.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In approximately two-thirds of cases of AHT, retinal hemorrhage occurs in multiple layers (eg, preretinal, intraretinal, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subretinal) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61192\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61192 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Less commonly, patients also have vitreous hemorrhage. Dense preretinal or vitreous hemorrhage may obscure underlying retinal hemorrhage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some patients have white-centered hemorrhages that may be caused by fibrin plugs, ischemia, artifactual reflection, or central resolution (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69742\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69742 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/19,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,44</a>]. These white-centered hemorrhages should not be described as Roth spots because doing so falsely implies an infectious origin (ie, endocarditis), which may confuse the child's evaluation. White-centered retinal hemorrhages are a non-specific finding and not diagnostic of septic emboli.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Grading of retinal hemorrhages tends to be subjective, and there is currently no single recognized standard grading system. The best description of the hemorrhages is to specify the laterality, number, type(s), and locations of retinal hemorrhages, as well as the presence or absence of macular retinoschisis with or without hemorrhagic macular cyst, retinal folds, and presence of other ocular findings. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Retinal hemorrhages in AHT occur along a spectrum of severity, ranging from mild to severe: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Mild</strong> &ndash; Few in number (less than about 10) intraretinal hemorrhages primarily in the posterior pole, usually in a peripapillary and perivascular pattern</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Severe</strong> &ndash; Too numerous to count, diffusely distributed multi-layered retinal hemorrhages (intraretinal, preretinal, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subretinal hemorrhages) in the posterior pole and retinal periphery, with hemorrhages present in the far retinal periphery near the ora serrata. The midperiphery of the retina may be spared.

Although the severity of the retinal hemorrhage is typically limited, ipsilateral severe hemorrhagic retinopathy has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Typically, the pattern of hemorrhage is one of vitreous and preretinal hemorrhage less than intraretinal hemorrhage, and there are few hemorrhages, even if there is a large preretinal hemorrhage, in contrast to AHT, which may have many more hemorrhages. The combination of intraocular hemorrhage and intracranial hemorrhage has been referred to as Terson syndrome and is uncommon in infants and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/13,88,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,88,89</a>]. However, note that the term &ldquo;Terson syndrome&rdquo; is best avoided, as it does not imply a specific etiology but rather the coincident presence of intraocular and intracranial hemorrhage. The presence of a vascular anomaly and the pattern of IOH help distinguish this diagnosis from AHT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brain-arteriovenous-malformations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brain arteriovenous malformations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1103681052\"><span class=\"h2\">Raised intracranial pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less acute increases in intracranial pressure are associated only with superficial intraretinal or optic disc hemorrhages, located in the peripapillary region and adjacent or on a swollen optic nerve head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Raised intracranial pressure does not cause more widespread or multilayered retinal hemorrhage, nor does it cause retinoschisis or retinal folds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2708206290\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebral venous sinus and cortical vein thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retinal hemorrhages can be seen in association with cerebral venous thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. However, these hemorrhages are seen only in the presence of coincident factors and the patterns of retinal hemorrhage observed match the patterns caused by those factors, such as peripapillary superficial intraretinal hemorrhages from raised intracranial pressure and posterior pole intraretinal hemorrhages from sepsis, suggesting that venous thrombosis itself is not directly causative. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Glutaric aciduria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glutaric aciduria type 1 is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder that is sometimes associated with subdural hemorrhage after minor head trauma. Preexisting macrocephaly is a hallmark of the condition. Glutaric aciduria eventually results in serious neurological compromise, but affected children may have normal development in early childhood. Approximately 20 percent of patients with glutaric aciduria type 1 have seizures, and 20 to 30 percent have subdural hemorrhages or effusions that may raise the suspicion of AHT. Children with glutaric aciduria may be more prone to subdural hemorrhage after minor accidental trauma because of increased extra-axial fluid spaces. Retinal hemorrhages may also occur, typically just a few pre- or intraretinal hemorrhages that are confined to the posterior pole, though the range of severity of ocular manifestations is not fully described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].

Glutaric aciduria is diagnosed through urinary screening. Characteristic basal ganglia disease can develop even in the absence of significant changes in glutaric acid concentrations. The neuroimaging findings help to distinguish glutaric aciduria from AHT.

However, retinal hemorrhages rarely, if ever, result from CPR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/13,34,59,93-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,34,59,93-95</a>]. In contrast to retinal hemorrhages associated with AHT, CPR-associated retinal hemorrhages are few in number and confined to the posterior pole.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Purtscher retinopathy</strong> &ndash; A severe and abrupt increase in intrathoracic pressure may cause intraocular abnormalities, possibly related to complement activation, microemboli, and nerve fiber infarcts (Purtscher retinopathy). Purtscher retinopathy may occur following severe acute compression injuries to the thorax, with characteristic manifestations including white retinal patches (the predominant feature), few retinal hemorrhages, and retinal edema most commonly surrounding the optic disc. These findings do not resemble the retinal hemorrhages seen in AHT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Purtscher retinopathy is not a characteristic finding of AHT, though it rarely may be seen (presumably related to the same compression of the thorax that results in rib fractures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. The lack of a single case report of Purtscher retinopathy following CPR provides additional evidence that CPR with chest compression is an unlikely cause of retinal hemorrhage.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Sudden infant death syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a common cause of death in children between 1 and 12 months of age. Children who die from SIDS may share several features with those who are victims of AHT, including the absence of explanatory history and the possibility of a prodromal syndrome such as gastrointestinal complaints. However, by definition, SIDS victims have no evidence of trauma by history, clinical examination, or autopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-unexpected-infant-death-including-sids-initial-management#H13236298\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden unexpected infant death including SIDS: Initial management&quot;, section on 'Fatal child abuse'</a>.)</p><p>Thus, most deaths related to child abuse can be distinguished from SIDS by a complete autopsy, death scene investigation, and a review of the medical history. However, the autopsy cannot distinguish between accidental or deliberate asphyxiation with a soft object and SIDS, although certain factors should raise the suspicion for deliberate asphyxiation and are discussed in detail separately.

Dense hemorrhages in the vitreous can interfere with vision and may cause amblyopia in young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].
