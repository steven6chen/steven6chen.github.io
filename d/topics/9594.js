Cancer happens when normal cells change into abnormal cells and grow out of control.</p><p>There are different kinds of Kaposi sarcoma. One type is called &quot;classic&quot; Kaposi sarcoma. It is very rare and happens mostly in older adults. It grows very slowly and does not always need to be treated.</p><p>Another type of Kaposi sarcoma, which is much more common, happens in people who have HIV or AIDS. HIV is a virus that affects the body's infection-fighting system, also called the immune system. People with HIV can get sick easily, because their immune system can't fight off infections or cancer well. The most serious stage of HIV infection, when the immune system is very weak, is called AIDS. In people with HIV or AIDS, Kaposi sarcoma usually grows quickly and needs to be treated.</p><p>Kaposi sarcoma can also happen in people who have had organ transplant surgery. Transplant surgery is when a doctor replaces a diseased organ (such as the kidney, heart, or liver) with a healthy organ.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H202540092\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Kaposi sarcoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When it first develops, Kaposi sarcoma looks like a red, pink, purple, blue, or brown area of skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83856\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83856 \">picture 1</a>). It usually starts out flat, but can become raised or bumpy. Kaposi sarcoma often happens on the legs or feet, but can grow on the nose or genitals, or in the mouth of people with HIV or AIDS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83857\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83857 \">picture 2</a>). Sometimes, Kaposi sarcoma causes swelling of the legs (or other affected body part.)</p><p>In people with HIV or AIDS, Kaposi sarcoma can also grow inside the body, such as in the digestive tract or lungs.</p><p>Kaposi sarcoma in the digestive tract can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood in the bowel movements</p><p/><p>Kaposi sarcoma in the lungs and airways can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cough or coughing up blood</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H202540141\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for Kaposi sarcoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will do an exam and a test called a biopsy. For a biopsy, he or she will take a small sample of the abnormal area. Then another doctor will look at the sample under a microscope.</p><p>You might have other tests to check for Kaposi sarcoma in other parts of your body. This will depend on your symptoms and individual situation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H202540156\"><span class=\"h1\">What is cancer staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, cancer staging is a way in which doctors find out how far a cancer has spread in the body.</p><p>Staging for Kaposi sarcoma is not always necessary. It is sometimes done for people with HIV or AIDS. Staging involves finding out how far the cancer has spread in the body. It also involves finding out how well a person's immune system is working and how healthy he or she is.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H202540171\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Kaposi sarcoma treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the type of Kaposi sarcoma, how big the growths are, and where they are.</p><p>People with slow-growing classic Kaposi sarcoma might not need treatment right away. But their doctor will monitor their condition closely to watch for changes.</p><p>In people with HIV or AIDS, Kaposi sarcoma is not usually treated directly. Instead, these people get treated for their HIV infection with medicines called antiretroviral medicines. These medicines help keep the HIV virus in the body under control so that the immune system can work better and also combat the cancer.</p><p>Other treatments for Kaposi sarcoma can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove the cancer</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation can kill cancer cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. Sometimes, people get chemotherapy directly into their cancer. Other times, people get chemotherapy through a thin tube that goes into their vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that go directly on the parts of the skin affected by the cancer</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Special socks called &quot;compression stockings&quot; that fit tightly over the leg &ndash; These can help reduce leg swelling.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H202540186\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for Kaposi sarcoma can involve making many choices, such as what treatment to have. Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H202540201\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-aids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: HIV/AIDS (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=starting-treatment-for-hiv-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Starting treatment for HIV (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-your-cancer-treatment-makes-you-tired-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When your cancer treatment makes you tired (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-loss-of-appetite-and-weight-loss-with-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing loss of appetite and weight loss with cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-with-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting with cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hair-loss-from-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hair loss from cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-care-during-advanced-illness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medical care during advanced illness (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-hiv-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Initial treatment of HIV (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=symptoms-of-hiv-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Symptoms of HIV infection (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
