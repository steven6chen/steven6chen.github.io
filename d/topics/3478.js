Chronic daily headache types with individual headaches of long duration (ie, four hours or more) include chronic migraine, chronic tension-type headache, medication overuse headache, hemicrania continua, and new daily persistent headache.</p><p>This topic will discuss chronic migraine (previously known as transformed migraine). Other types of chronic daily headache are reviewed elsewhere.

Furthermore, in patients with migraine, functional and structural alterations in the brain have been identified that correlate with longer disease duration and increased headache frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-migraine/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. However, it is not clear whether these alterations lead to chronic migraine.

It causes significant reductions in quality of life and is even more disabling than episodic migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-migraine/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. In addition, chronic migraine results in enormous expense to society. In the United States, the direct and indirect costs of migraine are estimated to be more than 20 billion dollars annually, and a significant proportion of this cost is attributable to chronic migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-migraine/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Through a process known as &quot;migraine transformation,&quot; some patients with an episodic migraine pattern (&lt;15 headache days a month) transition to a chronic migraine pattern (&ge;15 headache days a month) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-migraine/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive treatment of migraine in adults&quot;, section on 'Calcium channel blockers'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive treatment of migraine in adults&quot;, section on 'Other agents'</a>.)</p><p>We suggest the use of second-line agents for the prevention of chronic migraine when first-line drugs have failed, and third-line agents when first-line and second-line agents have failed. These recommendations are based upon our clinical experience. Like first-line agents, the choice among the second- and third-line drugs depends upon individual patient factors, as discussed in the next section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Choosing an agent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of specific prophylactic agent for either episodic or chronic migraine depends upon individual patient factors, including the presence of comorbid conditions such as medical disorders, psychiatric disorders, sleep disorders, fatigue, other types of pain, and gastrointestinal complaints. As an example, tricyclics or other antidepressants may be preferred for patients who are depressed or prone to depression. On the other hand, beta blockers may be preferred for patients with hypertension. However, with some preventive agents, the doses used to treat migraine are insufficient to treat comorbid conditions. Thus, dosing may need to be adjusted if the intent is to treat a comorbid condition.</p><p>Regardless of the drug chosen, application of certain principles may improve the success rate of prophylactic migraine therapy and reduce complications:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start oral drugs at a low dose and increase gradually</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give the chosen medication an adequate trial</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid overuse of acute headache medications</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> for women of childbearing potential unless it is essential to management and alternative therapies are not appropriate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Address patient expectations and preferences</p><p/><p>These points are discussed in greater detail elsewhere.

Modalities include behavioral therapy (eg, biofeedback, cognitive-behavioral therapy, stress management, relaxation therapy) and physical therapy (eg, exercise, heat, cold packs, electrical stimulation). In addition, therapeutic lifestyle changes (good sleep hygiene, routine meal schedules, regular exercise) and avoidance of migraine triggers are often advocated for patients with chronic migraine. However, there is a paucity of high-quality studies examining the role of nonpharmacologic interventions specifically for chronic migraine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Avoidance of migraine triggers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with chronic migraine are more likely to have headaches triggered by stress, not eating, odors, neck pain, smoke, sleeping late, and exercise than patients with episodic migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-migraine/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. These are discussed in detail separately.

Of course, patients with continuous headaches are less likely to be able to determine specific migraine triggers than those who have episodic headaches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Behavioral and physical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In agreement with guidelines for migraine headache (mainly based upon studies of episodic migraine) from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) published in 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-migraine/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], we suggest the use of behavioral therapy for migraine prevention. Options include relaxation training, thermal biofeedback combined with relaxation training, electromyographic biofeedback, or cognitive-behavioral therapy. The choice among these interventions should be individualized according to factors that include clinician familiarity, local availability and expertise, and patient preference.</p><p>In our clinical experience, physical therapy may be useful for the treatment of chronic migraine in patients who have constant muscle tension or in those who report onset of muscle tension preceding migraine headaches. Of note, the AAN guidelines concluded that evidence-based recommendations could not be made regarding the use of hypnosis, acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, chiropractic or osteopathic cervical manipulation, occlusal adjustment, or hyperbaric oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-migraine/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Both behavioral therapy and physical therapy may be combined with each other <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with preventive drug therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-migraine/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H634848644\"><span class=\"h3\">Occipital nerve stimulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are inconsistent data from small randomized trials regarding the benefit of occipital nerve stimulation for the treatment of chronic migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-migraine/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. In the largest trial, there was no significant difference at 12 weeks for the primary endpoint, the percentage of patients that had a &ge;50 percent reduction in mean daily pain score in the active compared with the control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-migraine/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, there were statistically significant if modest improvements with active stimulation for a number of secondary endpoints, including the percentage of patients with a &ge;30 percent reduction in mean daily pain score, and reduction in the mean number of headache days and migraine-related disability. The findings from these reports are limited by concerns about blinding in the control (sham treatment) groups, given that active treatment causes paresthesia, and relatively high rates of complications, including lead migration in 14 to 24 percent of subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-migraine/abstract/54-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-57</a>].
