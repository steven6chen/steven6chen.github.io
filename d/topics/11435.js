In a meta-analysis of eight studies that reported all-cause mortality in patients with MINOCA, in-hospital mortality was 0.9 percent and 12-month mortality was 4.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-infarction-with-no-obstructive-coronary-atherosclerosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

They may involve the epicardial vessels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the coronary microcirculation. The subdivision into epicardial and microvascular causes is somewhat arbitrary but allows for one way to think about them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11320599\"><span class=\"h2\">Epicardial</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11320607\"><span class=\"h3\">Coronary artery spasm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coronary artery spasm, as seen in &ldquo;variant angina,&rdquo; usually occurs at a localized segment of an epicardial artery, but sometimes involves two or more segments of the same (multifocal spasm) or of different (multivessel spasm) coronary arteries. It may also involve diffusely one or multiple coronary branches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-infarction-with-no-obstructive-coronary-atherosclerosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Coronary artery spasm is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasospastic-angina\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vasospastic angina&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among studies in patients with MINOCA, the reported prevalence of coronary spasm is extremely variable (3 to 95 percent) and this has been attributed to the different <span class=\"nowrap\">stimuli/provocative</span> tests used to diagnose spasm, and different definitions of spasm. Ethnic reasons have also been invoked, as the prevalence of epicardial coronary artery spasm is higher in Asian than in Caucasian patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-infarction-with-no-obstructive-coronary-atherosclerosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Myocardial bridging, per se, is unlikely to&nbsp;cause&nbsp;MINOCA. However, it can predispose&nbsp;the affected artery to spasm. MINOCA patients with bridging seen on coronary angiography should be considered for provocative testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11320613\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute thrombosis at the site of non-obstructive eccentric plaque thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many atherosclerotic plaques expand outward rather than encroaching on the arterial lumen. These &rdquo;positively-remodelled&rdquo; plaques are often lipid rich and have a thin fibrous cap; they are vulnerable to rupture into the lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-infarction-with-no-obstructive-coronary-atherosclerosis/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. Transient and partial thrombosis at the site of a non-obstructive plaque with subsequent spontaneous fibrinolysis and distal embolization may be one of the mechanisms responsible for the occurrence of MINOCA. Similarly, coronary erosion with loss of surface endothelium, possibly due to hyaluronan and neutrophil accumulation, can also cause MINOCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-infarction-with-no-obstructive-coronary-atherosclerosis/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>].

Thus, intracoronary imaging modalities are crucial in this setting. Plaque rupture or erosion has been diagnosed by intravascular ultrasound in about 40 percent of women with MINOCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-infarction-with-no-obstructive-coronary-atherosclerosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Optical coherence tomography, due to its high resolution, may provide additional information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-infarction-with-no-obstructive-coronary-atherosclerosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>As MINOCA is associated with a risk of recurrent cardiovascular events over time, comparable with that of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and obstructive atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-infarction-with-no-obstructive-coronary-atherosclerosis/abstract/4,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11,12</a>], these patients require dual antiplatelet treatment for 12 months and statins. In particular, long-term lipid-lowering therapy with statins after MI is associated with a significant increase of the fibrous-cap thickness, paralleling the reduction of the lipid content of the plaque [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-infarction-with-no-obstructive-coronary-atherosclerosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Similarly, the G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene has been associated with MI in the young. Protein C and S deficiency, as well as enhanced Factor VII activity, have been occasionally related to MINOCA. It seems that such thrombophilia conditions may favor MI but they are not able to cause MI per se [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-infarction-with-no-obstructive-coronary-atherosclerosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

It should be suspected in patients with MINOCA and one of the following conditions associated with high risk of systemic embolism: prosthetic heart valves, atrial fibrillation (AF), dilated cardiomyopathy with apical thrombus, rheumatic heart disease with mitral stenosis, infective endocarditis, and atrial myxoma. Paradoxical embolism is a rare cause of MINOCA. Importantly, in patients in whom paradoxical embolism is suspected, coronary angiography needs to be carefully analyzed for the identification of amputation (also called &ldquo;stops&rdquo;) of distal (peripheral) coronary branches. Transthoracic, transesophageal, and contrast-enhanced echocardiography are the cornerstone methods for detection of cardiac sources of embolism as causes of MINOCA.

(See <a href=\"#H11320593\" class=\"local\">'Causes'</a> above.). </p><p>Our approach to elucidating the cause of MINOCA uses information in the patient&rsquo;s history as well as that from an assessment of left ventricular (LV) wall motion, preferably with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). If TTE has not been performed before coronary angiography, it can be performed in the catheterization laboratory or left ventriculography can be performed as a substitute. However, information from the history, coronary angiography, or evaluation of LV wall motion, is neither sensitive nor specific for a particular cause. </p><p>The following are a few examples of the way in which the history or assessment of LV wall motion may direct the evaluation. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a chronic pattern of recurrent episodes of chest pain suggesting episodic angina are more likely to have vasospasm than other diagnoses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regional wall motion abnormalities may indicate that an epicardial cause of MINOCA, such as vasospasm or thrombosis, on a nonobstructive atherosclerotic plaque is likely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left ventriculography or echocardiography showing apical ballooning with akinesis or dyskinesis of the apical one-half to two-thirds of the LV suggests Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary artery embolism should be considered in patients with prosthetic heart valves, chronic atrial fibrillation, dilated cardiomyopathy with apical thrombus, infective endocarditis, and atrial myxoma. </p><p/><p>Aside from coronary angiography and assessment of LV wall motion, the following tests may be useful for elucidating the cause of MINOCA: optical coherence tomography (OCT) or intravascular ultrasound (IVUS); acetylcholine (Ach) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ergonovine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ergonovine</a> challenge; cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with contrast material <span class=\"nowrap\">(CMR/CM);</span> endomyocardial biopsy; contrast enhance echocardiography and transesophageal echocardiography; and testing for markers of thrombophilia (eg, protein C and S deficiency, as well as enhanced Factor VII activity). The sequence in which these tests are performed depends on the likelihood of the cause based on the history and evaluation of LV wall motion.</p><p>If coronary angiography is abnormal but reveals less than 50 luminal obstruction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> non-occlusive thrombus, we often perform IVUS or OCT to identify subcritical plaque fissure and thrombus. These studies are performed before the patient is discharged from the catheterization laboratory.

This test is performed before the patient is discharged from the catheterization laboratory. It should be kept in mind that the diagnosis of coronary artery spasm does not require confirmation of spasm with provocative testing. Provocative testing is performed only when the diagnosis of variant angina is suspected, but not firmly established. Provocative testing may also suggest a diagnosis of microvascular dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H11320633\" class=\"local\">'Coronary microvascular dysfunction'</a> above.)

Finally, intracoronary Ach test may suggest coronary microvascular dysfunction as the cause of MINOCA.</p><p>If a cause of MI has not been identified in the catheterization laboratory with the above strategy, additional testing can be performed.

The observational nature of this study makes us uncertain of the potential magnitude of the benefit of these interventions and we believe further study is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1561438020\"><span class=\"h1\">RECOMMENDATIONS OF OTHERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A European Society of Cardiology working group has published a position paper on myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-infarction-with-no-obstructive-coronary-atherosclerosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].
