Atrial flutter puts people at risk for stroke and other problems.</p><p>In atrial flutter, the electrical signals that control the heartbeat become abnormal. As a result, the heart's upper chambers stop pumping effectively. Blood that should move out of these chambers gets left behind. As the blood pools, it can start to form clots. These clots can travel up to the brain through the blood vessels, and cause strokes.</p><p>Atrial flutter happens most often in people who had recent heart surgery or who have certain heart conditions, such as a heart valve problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H154416373\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of atrial flutter?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people have no symptoms. When symptoms do happen, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling like your heart is beating fast, beating hard, or skipping beats</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling light-headed or dizzy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fainting, or feeling like you are going to faint</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H154416388\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for atrial flutter?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will do an electrocardiogram (also called an &quot;ECG&quot; or &quot;EKG&quot;), which measures the electrical activity in your heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53145\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53145 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Your doctor will also do other tests to look for heart problems that could be causing your atrial flutter. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An echocardiogram (also called an &quot;echo&quot;) &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create a picture of the heart as it beats (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77971\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77971 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An exercise stress test &ndash; During this test, the doctor will record your ECG while you exercise on a treadmill or bike (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60855\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60855 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A home heart monitor &ndash; This test records your heartbeat over the course of hours or days.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H154416403\"><span class=\"h1\">How is atrial flutter treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on your symptoms and what's causing your atrial flutter.</p><p>People who have no symptoms might not need treatment. This is because atrial flutter sometimes changes back to a normal heart rhythm without treatment (after days or weeks).</p><p>When treatment is needed, it can include 1 or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to change the heart rhythm back to normal, or control the speed or rhythm of the heartbeat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to prevent blood clots from forming</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardioversion &ndash; During this procedure, the doctor gives the heart a mild electrical current to change the rhythm back to normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ablation &ndash; During this procedure, the doctor uses heat or cold to destroy the small part of the heart that is sending the abnormal electrical signals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pacemaker &ndash; This is a device that goes under the skin near a person's heart. It sends electrical signals to the heart to control the heartbeat.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H154416418\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people with atrial flutter are able to live fairly normal lives. Still, it is important that you take your medicines every day, as prescribed by your doctor. Taking your medicines will help lower the chances that your atrial flutter will cause a stroke. Even so, it's a good idea to learn the signs and symptoms of a stroke (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73487\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73487 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H154416433\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-atrial-fibrillation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for atrial fibrillation (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tachycardia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tachycardia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-fainting-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Syncope (fainting) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-and-stress-test-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: ECG and stress test (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiogram-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Echocardiogram (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-ablation-for-the-heart-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Catheter ablation for the heart (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacemakers-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pacemakers (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-fainting-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Syncope (fainting) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacemakers-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pacemakers (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardioversion-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Cardioversion (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-ablation-for-abnormal-heartbeats-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Catheter ablation for abnormal heartbeats (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Stroke symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
