The major causes of cervical spine injury include trauma that is associated with one of the following mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe force (eg, motor vehicle collision [MVC] or fall of a distance that is greater than the child's height) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diving and axial load (eg, force applied to the top of the head) biomechanics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acceleration-deceleration of the head (eg, hitting the head on the dashboard during a head-on collision)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple system trauma </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain sports or recreational activities (eg, football, hockey, wrestling, bicycling, trampoline use, or all-terrain vehicle riding) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete-with-neck-pain-or-injury#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the child or adolescent athlete with neck pain or injury&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>)</p><p/><p>Mechanisms of injury vary by age and influence observed patterns of cervical spine trauma and outcomes. The majority of cervical spine injuries result from trauma to the top of the head or the neck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birth &ndash; Vaginal delivery of infants in the breech position</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birth to eight years &ndash; MVCs and falls</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older than eight years &ndash; MVCs and sports injuries</p><p/><p>The location of injury also varies significantly by age. Axial cervical spine injuries (occiput to C2 region) account for approximately three-quarters of injuries in children younger than eight years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In older children, the subaxial cervical spine (C3 to C7) is the site of injury in just over half of patients.</p><p>Cervical spine injuries frequently warrant surgical intervention and are associated with permanent neurologic deficits and death in up to 21 and 7 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children younger than eight years of age are more susceptible to injury to the axial cervical spine (occiput to C2) than older children and adults because of certain features of their anatomic development (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55343\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55343 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,2,8,9,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8,9,11,12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They have relatively larger heads than bodies.

Two factors may contribute to this problem:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The immature growth centers are susceptible to sheer forces during rapid deceleration or hyperflexion-extension, particularly at the synchondrosis between the odontoid and vertebral body of C2.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The young spinal column is more elastic than is the spinal cord and is able to tolerate more distraction before rupture (up to 5 cm versus only 5 to 6 mm in the spinal cord). This feature is also one of the reasons why spinal cord injury can occur without radiographic evidence of spinal column injury in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The most common injuries in older children are vertebral body and arch fractures. These fractures usually are in the lower cervical spine; such injuries are less common in children younger than eight years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13,14</a>].</p><p>Anatomy of the cervical spine and neck is discussed in greater detail separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Primary survey'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2634661051\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal motion restriction (spinal immobilization)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the initial assessment and management, the clinician must suspect a cervical spine injury in any patient with multiple blunt trauma and take precautions to limit spine motion during the primary survey, especially in patients with significant head, neck, or torso trauma or with an altered level of consciousness. Padding under the shoulder and back and use of the &quot;sniffing position&quot; is important to open the airway maximally and maintain a neutral cervical spine position in the infant or young child (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F114553\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef114553 \">figure 1</a>). Note that this positioning is markedly different from adults where padding under the head is frequently required to achieve neutral cervical spine position. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric cervical spinal motion restriction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2187550533\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The emergency clinician should anticipate airway management problems in children with cervical spine injury. Unstable lesions above C3 may cause immediate respiratory paralysis, and lower cervical lesions may cause delayed phrenic nerve paralysis from ascending edema of the spinal cord. Cervical spinal column injury may also be associated with airway obstruction from retropharyngeal hemorrhage, edema, or maxillofacial trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;, section on 'Cervical cord'</a>.)</p><p>In patients who cannot maintain their airway, the clinician should employ a jaw thrust (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53277\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53277 \">figure 2</a>) or chin lift to open the airway while maintaining the cervical spine in neutral position. When indicated by altered mental status or inadequate respiration, rapid sequence intubation (RSI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51456 \">table 2</a>) should be performed with in-line cervical spine stabilization by an assistant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80874 \">figure 3</a>). Intubation should be accomplished using the orotracheal route. Laryngoscopy with a video laryngoscope may permit better visualization of the larynx while minimizing cervical spine movement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children#H18429782\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Devices for difficult endotracheal intubation in children&quot;, section on 'Video laryngoscope'</a>.)</p><p>RSI and emergency endotracheal intubation in children are discussed in greater detail separately.

However, clinicians must first assume that hypotension following trauma results from hemorrhage and ensure appropriate fluid resuscitation.

Serious head injury and multiple-system trauma are commonly associated with spinal injuries and may distract the child (and medical provider) from recognizing and appreciating cervical pain or other important symptoms. </p><p>Cervical spine injury can occur through flexion, extension, vertical compression, rotation, or a combination of these forces. Most spinal cord injuries result from direct compression or disruption of the cord by fracture fragments or subluxed vertebrae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In children younger than three years of age, it is especially prudent to suspect cervical spine injury based upon the mechanism of injury because they typically are unable to provide a history and cooperate with the examination.</p><p>The mechanism of injury may predict the type of injury and the radiologic findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperflexion injuries may cause wedge fractures of the anterior vertebral body with disruption of the posterior elements in older children and adolescents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75142\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75142 \">image 1</a>). Examples include the clay-shoveler's fracture, an avulsion fracture of the base of the spinous process of C6, C7, or T1, and the teardrop fracture with anterior displacement of a triangular bony fragment of the anteroinferior portion of the vertebral body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperextension injuries may cause compression of the posterior elements and disruption of the anterior longitudinal ligament. An example is the hangman's fracture of the posterior neural arch of C1 or the pedicles of C2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65350\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65350 \">image 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Axial loading may cause burst or comminuted fractures of the arches of C1 in the upper cervical spine or of the vertebral bodies in the lower cervical spine. The Jefferson burst fracture, for example, consists of fractures of the arches of C1 and lateral displacement of C1 with respect to C2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51760\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51760 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77232\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77232 \">image 3</a>). Axial loading also may cause compression fractures of the vertebra (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54151\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54151 \">image 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rotational injuries may cause fracture or dislocation of the facets. These injuries are uncommon in isolation and occur more frequently in combination with flexion or extension injuries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation, a common, generally benign injury in younger children usually occurs as a result of minor trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-torticollis-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired torticollis in children&quot;, section on 'Atlantoaxial rotary subluxation'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who have neurologic symptoms (eg, paresthesias, numbness, or weakness) or neck pain suggestive of spinal injury should have restricted spinal motion during initial evaluation and management and undergo rapid radiologic evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric cervical spinal motion restriction&quot;, section on 'Techniques'</a> and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Cervical spine imaging'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic symptoms</strong> &ndash; Patients may complain of either transient or persistent paresthesias, numbness or weakness. The distribution of symptoms is variable and ranges from involvement of the hands or feet to dramatic neurologic deficits, including quadriplegia. The patient's ability to walk does <strong>not</strong> exclude cervical spine injury. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Not all children who have spinal cord injuries complain of symptoms; some are asymptomatic, whereas others are unable to express their symptoms (eg, preverbal or severely injured) or have a distracting injury. For example, in a retrospective review of 72 previously normal children with cervical spine injury, 10 patients were initially asymptomatic on evaluation. However, all asymptomatic patients had both a high-risk injury mechanism and comorbid (distracting) injuries from multiple trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The history should include the presence of symptoms at any time after the injury, even if they have resolved. Transient burning dysesthesias in the hands and fingers may indicate hyperextension of the cervical spine with central cord contusion (eg, the &quot;burning hands&quot; syndrome that has been observed in football players). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cervical spinal cord and cervical peripheral nerve injuries in the child or adolescent athlete&quot;, section on 'Cervical cord neurapraxia'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Transient symptoms (eg, paresthesias, weakness) may also be the only indication of spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA). Thus, it is critical to have a high index of suspicion and to ask specifically about transient symptoms in any patient whose mechanism of injury is consistent with potential cervical spine injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children#H26107906\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical features and diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When nerve symptoms are unilateral, only involve the arm, and are associated with shoulder depression and lateral neck flexion (eg, tackling in football), then transient brachial plexus injury (&quot;burner&quot; or &quot;stinger&quot;) may have occurred. However, careful evaluation is needed to exclude symptoms and signs of cervical spine injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76379\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76379 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cervical-spinal-cord-and-cervical-peripheral-nerve-injuries-in-the-child-or-adolescent-athlete#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cervical spinal cord and cervical peripheral nerve injuries in the child or adolescent athlete&quot;, section on 'Cervical burners'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neck symptoms</strong> &ndash; The classic triad of neck symptoms includes localized cervical pain, muscle spasm, and decreased range of neck motion.

However, only four children younger than nine years of age and none younger than two years of age were included in the cohort which limits the applicability of these results in younger children.

Plain radiographs have adequate sensitivity to identify or exclude unstable cervical spine fractures or dislocations, especially in awake children with reliable physical examinations (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Plain radiographs'</a> below).

Furthermore, the radiation dose should be adjusted according to the &quot;as low as reasonably achievable&quot; (ALARA) principle. </p><p>This approach to the use of CT for pediatric cervical spine imaging balances the potential long-term risk of radiation exposure and cost of the study with the need for diagnostic certainty in severely injured patients. A helical cervical spine CT delivers a 50 percent increase in mean radiation dose to the cervical spine in pediatric patients relative to conventional radiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In addition, the radiation dose to the skin and thyroid for CT evaluation of the cervical spine is approximately 10 times and 14 times, respectively, that of a five-view cervical spine series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>] and is even further magnified when compared to the standard three-view cervical spine series used in trauma patients. Children, especially those younger than five years, are more prone to radiation-induced malignancies due to increased radiosensitivity of certain organs and a longer latency period to develop a cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Estimated lifetime cancer mortality risks attributable to the radiation exposure from a CT for a one year old is approximately 0.07 to 0.18 percent, which is a risk that is an order of magnitude higher than that for adults who are exposed to a CT of the cervical spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Thus, the risk of radiation exposure exceeds the benefit of CT imaging in the majority of children evaluated for cervical spine injury, except for those with a higher likelihood of abnormality as determined by the initial evaluation. </p><p>MRI should be performed in patients with an abnormal neurologic examination or when imaging of the spinal cord or other soft tissues of the spinal column is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. MRI is less sensitive than CT for the detection of fractures of the posterior elements of the cervical spine and injuries to the craniocervical junction. The performance of an MRI in severely injured children is hampered by the extended time needed for the study, the requirement for sedation or anesthesia to perform the study in most children, the need for compatible equipment (eg, monitors and ventilators), and limited access to the patient during the study.

Although the bony anatomy of the pediatric cervical spine is similar to that of an adult by 8 to 10 years of age, radiographic findings may differ until 15 years of age. In younger children, avulsions and epiphyseal separation are more common than are fractures. Furthermore, normal anatomic variants of the cervical spine in children (such as absence of cervical lordosis, incomplete ossification of the posterior elements, ligamentous laxity, and pseudosubluxation of C2 on C3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63065\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63065 \">figure 6</a>)) must be distinguished from pathological findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71839\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71839 \">table 11</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13,46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,46-48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h5\">Lateral view</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete evaluation of the lateral cervical spine requires that all seven cervical vertebrae be visualized.

With rotatory subluxation of C1 on C2, the dens is pulled closer to the affected side. This finding can also occur normally when the head is tilted or turned during imaging. The definitive diagnosis of atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation is made using dynamic CT or MRI and is often deferred to the outpatient setting, as it is usually a benign self-limiting process.

They may be useful in the rare instances when the three-view cervical spine series and CT are negative despite the presence of cervical pain, tenderness, or spasm. In the NEXUS study described above, 2 of the 818 patients with cervical spine injuries had stable bony injuries that were detected only with flexion-extension views. Another four patients had subluxation detected on flexion-extension views; they all had other injuries that were apparent with routine cervical spine imaging.</p><p>Flexion-extension views require the cooperation of the patient; they must be done only with active flexion and extension that is stopped if the patient has pain. Passive or painful flexion or extension should never be performed because they may precipitate or worsen spinal cord injury. Obtaining radiographs subacutely, after muscle spasm subsides, may be necessary to detect occult ligamentous injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h4\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sensitivity and specificity of CT for detecting cervical spine bony injury are 98 percent or better [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].

Consultation with a pediatric spine service is recommended for all children with neurologic abnormalities on examination or potentially unstable cervical spine injuries on imaging. If consultation is not available onsite, immediate transfer must be arranged to a center that can provide these services. Patients with unstable fractures have commonly sustained multisystem trauma, and the extent of their other injuries determines whether they require admission to an intensive care unit or other monitored setting once the cervical fracture is stabilized.</p><p>Treatment of unstable cervical fractures consists of closed reduction under fluoroscopic guidance and halo-vest immobilization. The halo is constructed of graphite or metal and is secured to the frontal and parietal areas of the skull with metal pins. The halo is the most common device applied for treatment of unstable cervical and upper thoracic fractures and dislocations as low as T3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>If plain radiographs or computed tomography (CT) demonstrate minor spinal fracture patterns and there is no neurologic deficit, then outpatient management may be possible, depending upon the extent of other injuries.

Treatment should include analgesics, and follow-up care should be arranged in all instances because even minor spinal column injuries may be associated with prolonged disability. If there is any ambiguity regarding spinal stability on plain radiographs, spine surgery consultation is warranted and a CT scan (and possibly an MRI if ligamentous injury is suspected) should be obtained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
