However, children with moderate to severe exacerbations require close observation for clinical deterioration, frequent treatments, and repeated evaluation. Thus, most children with moderate or severe asthma exacerbations should be managed in an ED setting.

For children with mild exacerbations, systemic glucocorticoids are usually added if the symptoms and signs of airway obstruction fail to resolve after the first treatment with inhaled beta-agonists. Children with moderate or severe exacerbations should receive systemic glucocorticoids as soon as possible. Additional pharmacotherapeutic agents that may be indicated in children with moderate or severe asthma include nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipratropium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ipratropium</a> bromide, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">magnesium sulfate</a>, and parenteral beta-agonists.

Beta-agonists may worsen this mismatch by causing pulmonary vasodilation in areas of the lung that are poorly ventilated. Humidified oxygen should be provided as needed to maintain an oxygen saturation of &ge;92 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-asthma-exacerbations-in-children-emergency-department-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Patients who require continuous nebulizer therapy continue to be monitored every 20 to 30 minutes. Clinicians may also find it helpful to measure peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). However, assessment of PEFR may have limited utility in the assessment of sicker or younger children. It is optimal if the child can make three attempts while standing (the best score is used), and it is most useful when it can be compared with the child's known personal best score.

In children who require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), measurement of PaCO<sub>2</sub> via ABG after a clinical plateau has been reached provides an objective measure of disease severity. Alternatively, end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> may be measured noninvasively via capnometry. In moderately or severely ill children, ABGs obtained before aggressive intervention often are abnormal but rarely affect management.
