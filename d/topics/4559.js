This layer helps to maintain blood vessel (vascular) tone, regulates hemostasis, acts as barrier to potentially toxic materials, and regulates inflammation. Endothelial dysfunction is the inability of the endothelium to optimally perform one or more of these.&nbsp;Endothelial dysfunction plays a key role in determining myocardial ischemia in all clinical manifestations of ischemic heart disease.&nbsp;Dysfunction of the coronary arterial endothelium is an important determinant of microvascular dysfunction. </p><p/><p>This topic will focus on clinical aspects of endothelial dysfunction, which is present in a few cardiac diseases, including large vessel (epicardial) coronary artery disease, small vessel disease (microvascular angina), and transplant vasculopathy. The discussion of the basic aspects of normal and abnormal endothelial function is found elsewhere.

It is caused by a variable combination of pre-existing microvascular dysfunction, ischemic damage, reperfusion damage, and distal thrombo-embolization. The diagnosis can be made invasively at the time of PCI or noninvasively by assessing ST segment elevation resolution or, more accurately, by cardiac magnetic resonance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3188416\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of coronary endothelial dysfunction is not fully known, as we only have studies that assess peripheral endothelial function in different methods and without specific guidelines regarding cutoff values for which a patient&rsquo;s endothelium is considered dysfunctional.

Direct testing, which is rarely performed for clinical purposes, involves an evaluation of biochemical and cellular integrity in the microcirculation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Indirect testing, which we do not routinely perform in any patient group, involves an evaluation of the coronary or peripheral arterial circulations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. The following discussion is about indirect testing.</p><p>The quantification of endothelial health using indirect methods is divided into peripheral endothelial function (a systemic measure of endothelial function) versus coronary endothelial function, which must be assessed with invasive angiography. Testing involves pharmacological <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physiological stimulation of the endothelial release of nitric oxide (NO) and other vasoactive substances. All the techniques have in common that they measure the response of the vessels to endothelial-dependent stimuli, mainly reactive hyperemia (shear stress) or vasoactive substances. Indeed, both macrovascular endothelial dysfunction, as measured by flow-mediated dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], and microvascular endothelial dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>] have been found to be independent predictors of future cardiovascular events in large cohort studies in healthy individuals over and above traditional risk factor assessment. Endothelial function testing modalities have also been found to correlate with other novel cardiovascular testing modalities such as coronary calcium scoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3185835\"><span class=\"h2\">Invasive testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quantitative coronary angiography can be used to directly and invasively examine the change in diameter in response to intracoronary infusions of endothelium-dependent vasodilators such as acetylcholine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Endothelial function of the coronary microvasculature can be assessed with intracoronary Doppler techniques to measure coronary blood flow in response to acetyl choline. Again, the normal response is coronary microvascular relaxation resulting in an increase of coronary blood flow. In contrast, patients with endothelial dysfunction exhibit reduced dilation or even coronary microvascular constriction associated with angina and ischemia, as typically observed in microvascular angina. </p><p>The coronary microvasculature can also be assessed with intracoronary Doppler techniques to measure coronary blood flow in response to non-endothelium-dependent pharmacological (usually intracoronary <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dipyridamole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dipyridamole</a>) stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. <strong> </strong></p><p>A similar method, based on slightly different physical properties, to test coronary microcirculatory function utilizes thermodilution and index of microcirculatory resistance. This technique is similar to pharmacological- and pressure-based techniques, but instead uses intracoronary temperature measurements to approximate flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. This has been shown to be independent of epicardial vascular function, reproducible, and has even been evaluated in ST elevation myocardial infarction patients, providing important prognostic information regarding ventricular function at three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359041748\"><span class=\"h2\">Noninvasive testing</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Brachial artery ultrasound</strong> &ndash; Brachial artery ultrasound is a commonly used and widely accepted measure of peripheral macrovascular endothelial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In this test, inflating a blood pressure cuff at suprasystolic pressures for five minutes occludes the upper arm proximal to the ultrasound measurement. Upon the release of the occlusion, an increase in shear stress results in an endothelial-dependent, nitric oxide NO-driven, flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery. Both diameter and blood velocity are assessed before and after occlusion with results being reported as a percent change from baseline. These measurements should be made at the end of diastole. The reported vascular response to increased flow has been shown to be a surrogate for measuring coronary endothelial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Aside from reactive hyperemia, stimuli for measuring endothelial reactivity can include exercise, mental stress, or sympathetic nervous activation through the cold pressor test. As with all vascular reactivity tests, brachial artery ultrasound measurements can be potentially confounded by conditions such as the amount, type, and time after food consumption; medications; exercise; ambient temperature; menstrual cycle stage; type of machinery and equipment; and variations in the protocol between subjects or experiments (supine, dark room, thermo-neutral settings). Furthermore, occlusions made too proximal can exacerbate the FMD response, creating a potential for false negative results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. <br/><br/>Observational data from the MESA study demonstrate that peripheral endothelial dysfunction, as measured by FMD of the brachial artery, is associated with a higher rate of incident adverse cardiovascular disease (CVD) events during a five-year follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. FMD has been linked with increased CVD risk in those patients with known CVD risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Furthermore, data from a meta-analysis provide evidence that FMD could be used as an independent prognostic indicator of future CVD events and offers incremental risk factor stratification in addition to traditional risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. While some have argued that there are only minimal data that FMD adds to risk stratification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], a more overwhelming body of evidence argues for the use of FMD measurements to provide important additional CVD risk factor stratification or response to therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Impedance plethysmography</strong> &ndash; Impedance plethysmography is a method of assessing endothelial function via strain-gauge venous impedance plethysmography that examines the changes in forearm blood flow in response to direct intravascular administration of vascular agonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Due to the invasive nature of this test, it is primarily used in research settings and rarely utilized clinically.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traditional imaging-based modalities have been clinically utilized to assess microvascular function. Myocardial positron emission tomography imaging has been tested using a cold pressor test in patients with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>] and verified in a larger cohort of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Cardiac magnetic resonance perfusion has been correlated with endothelial dysfunction in patients without overt coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], as well as those with typical angina but relatively normal angiograms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, cost and limited availability of the resources necessary for such prevent widespread adoption of these modalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Low-flow-mediated constriction</strong> &ndash; Low-flow-mediated constriction (L-FMC) quantitates the reaction in forearm conduit artery diameter occurring in response to a reduction in blood flow, and resultantly, shear stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. This method is similar to FMD measurements of the brachial artery, and is often used in concert to gain additional information regarding arterial reactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], as L-FMC is a better measure of resting, basal arterial tone, and thought to only be partially NO-mediated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Exact mechanisms of this reaction are still being elucidated, and it is becoming increasingly important as the rate of radial interventional approaches increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Nevertheless, the combination of these two measurements has been shown to be closely correlated to the severity of CAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>] and even provides additive risk factor stratification to traditional risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peripheral arterial tonometry</strong> &ndash; Peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) is a technique commonly used to assess microvascular endothelial function via changes in finger pulse wave amplitude in response to reactive hyperemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. Testing for endothelial function involves the inflation of a blood pressure cuff to supra-systolic pressures. During this process, there are two PAT probes connected to the fingers in both arms. The probe that is connected to the arm where the blood pressure cuff is inflated for five minutes is used to assess the reactive hyperemic response, a surrogate and a marker for endothelial function. These methodologies are noninvasive, are designed to eliminate environmental interference, and are independent of the subject&rsquo;s knowledge and conscious control of signals generated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. The RH-PAT index is defined as the ratio of the average pulsatile blood volume response, at timed intervals after deflation, to the baseline pulsatile blood volume response; ie, the average amplitude of the RH-PAT signal over 60 seconds at one, two, three, and four minutes after cuff deflation divided by the average amplitude of the RH-PAT signal over 3.5 minutes prior to cuff inflation (during baseline equilibration). <br/><br/>Work has shown a correlation between endothelial function, as measured through PAT, and the accepted standard of invasive assessment of endothelial dysfunction of the coronary arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Moreover, Goor et al. have demonstrated that there is a characteristic PAT signal response to mental stress, with diminution of the signal amplitude during stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. However, this test is only thought to be partially dependent on NO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>], while other factors such as the sympathetic nervous system are thought to affect the microvascular response to certain stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. There are discordant reports as to the agreement between FMD and PAT, as some reports highlight a discordance with PAT and FMD measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>], while others find an association between the two tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. There still appears to be a strong contribution by NO to both physiologic responses, leaving mechanistic work to resolve these discrepancies yet to be finished [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. <br/><br/>In addition to the endothelial function test being a predictive parameter for coronary disease onset, it can also predict the effectiveness of a treatment given to patients with cardiovascular disease. One study followed a group of hypertensive women without significant heart disease and who followed a similar antihypertensive regimen. While all women had similar reductions in blood pressure, the individuals whose endothelial function improved had half as many cardiovascular events compared to those women who showed no improvement in endothelial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Similarly, a high-risk group of patients with significant coronary diseases were treated with optimal medical therapy and given standard medications prescribed for their disease. The patients underwent endothelial function tests at baseline and six months with improvement seen in 50 percent of the patients. Those with improved endothelial function had fewer cardiovascular events during the follow-up period, whereas the group that did not have improved endothelial function had an increased CVD event rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. <br/><br/>Additional observational data examining microvascular endothelial function with PAT demonstrates people with relatively normal risk factors, but reduced endothelial function, had a higher incidence of heart disease, hospitalization, and death after seven years of follow-up, as compared to those without endothelial dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

The combination of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and statin therapy has also been shown to improve endothelial-dependent relaxation of the coronary vasculature through nitric oxide (NO)-dependent mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. <br/><br/>Fibrate therapy also improves fasting and post-prandial endothelial function in patients with type 2 diabetes, as does omega-3 fatty acid supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. The mechanism for this may be an increase in high density lipoproteins (HDL) and an attenuation of post-prandial lipemia and the associated oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

Although there has been some debate over the initial endothelial response to exercise, the overall data have been positive toward this lifestyle behavior and endothelial function. As an example, one study of 68 healthy men, aged 22 to 35 and 50 to 76, who were either sedentary or endurance-exercise trained, found that endurance-trained men did not have an age-associated decline of endothelium-dependent vasodilation; in addition, regular aerobic exercise restored the loss of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in previously sedentary middle-aged and older healthy men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss, particularly in obese individuals, has been shown to be beneficial to endothelial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/85-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">85-89</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H359046467\"><span class=\"h2\">Investigational interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We believe that the benefit from the following drugs or categories of drugs is less certain than those discussed above:&rdquo;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>L-arginine &ndash; The intravenous or intracoronary administration of L-arginine, the physiologic precursor for NO, can acutely improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation in patients with hypercholesterolemia or coronary atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. The stereoisomer D-arginine is ineffective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Additionally, a small randomized trial consisting of 30 patients appeared to show no benefit on multiple measures of endothelial health such as NO bioavailability, cell adhesion molecules, or brachial artery flow-mediated dilation with 9 g daily of L-arginine supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. These patients, however, were on optimal medical therapy for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. In contrast, a similarly sized trial showed that a similar dose of L-arginine after six months had a significant improvement in patients coronary endothelial function and resultantly improved anginal symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Additional work has shown short-term L-arginine supplementation to be of clinical benefit in a randomized study of 36 patients with stable class II and III angina. Compared to placebo, two weeks of therapy with a medical food bar enriched with L-arginine improved flow-mediated vasodilation, treadmill exercise time, and quality-of-life scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Data regarding L-Arginine and endothelial function appear to show that when given at doses of 2 g three times daily for one month, there is reduced blood pressure and angina symptoms in concert with improved endothelial function and quality of life in hypertensive patients without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Thus, although a narrow clinical niche, and a less-than-convenient dosing regimen, L-arginine supplementation can be beneficial in patients with non-obstructive CAD and debilitating angina by improving CVD risk factor parameters and symptoms. The longer-term effects of oral L-arginine have also been evaluated. Among patients with heart failure, oral L-arginine improved endothelial function, arterial compliance, and functional status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. The potential benefits associated with L-arginine therapies are presumably mediated by increased NO activity, particularly as it applies to improving the bioavailability of NO in areas of reduced endothelial shear stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. In addition to improved endothelial function, L-arginine supplementation has also been implicated in reducing plasma endothelin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>], reduced symptomatic burden via apoptosis of proliferating vascular smooth muscle cells leading to atherosclerotic plaque regression and other changes that have been described include lower plasma endothelin concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>], and finally arresting atherosclerotic plaque development in an animal model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nifedipine</a> &ndash; Nifedipine may have antioxidant effects and effects on endothelial NO synthase expression and activity.

The efficacy of quinapril was also evaluated in the TREND trial of men with coronary disease but without heart failure, hypertension, or lipid abnormalities improving endothelial dysfunction at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-clinical-aspects/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. These benefits were thought to be secondary to an improved NO-bioavailability through reduced bradykinin breakdown as well as improved reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging.
