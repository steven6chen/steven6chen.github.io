These abnormalities can result from disease of the testes (primary hypogonadism) or disease of the hypothalamus or pituitary (secondary hypogonadism). The distinction between these disorders, which will be described below, is made by measurement of the serum concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has primary hypogonadism if the serum testosterone concentration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the sperm count are below normal and the serum LH <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> FSH concentrations are above normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has secondary hypogonadism if the serum testosterone concentration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the sperm count are below normal and the serum LH <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> FSH concentrations are normal or low.</p><p/><p>In primary hypogonadism, spermatogenesis tends to be impaired to a greater degree than Leydig cell function, at least in its early stages. In contrast, both functions are impaired to the same degree with secondary hypogonadism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F97670\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97670 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Spermatogenesis cannot be increased in men with primary hypogonadism because of damage to the seminiferous tubules. However, successful pregnancies have now been reported with men with primary hypogonadism, including men with Klinefelter syndrome, using sperm extracted from the testes with subsequent in vitro fertilization by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatments-for-male-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatments for male infertility&quot;</a>). In contrast, men with secondary hypogonadism can often have spermatogenesis restored with gonadotropin therapy or pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) therapy (if pituitary function is normal and the patient has access to a center that provides this therapy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-of-fertility-in-men-with-secondary-hypogonadism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction of fertility in men with secondary hypogonadism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of male hypogonadism depend upon the age of onset, severity of testosterone deficiency, and whether there is a decrease in one or both of the two major functions of the testes: sperm production and testosterone production.</p><p>There are several possible clinical manifestations of testosterone deficiency, which are determined by its time of onset during reproductive development (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73293\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73293 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Time of onset</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A clinician should obtain an account of the developmental milestones of sexual development, current symptoms, and information about possible causes of hypogonadism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53842\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53842 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61467\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61467 \">table 3</a>).

Complete lack of testosterone production or androgen action during this period results in female external genitalia (clitoris and labia). Incomplete testosterone deficiency or androgen action causes partial virilization, ranging from posterior labioscrotal fusion and micropenis when the deficiency is severe to simply hypospadias when it is mild. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the infant with atypical genitalia (disorder of sex development)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of disorders of androgen action&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Third trimester</strong> &ndash; A history of micropenis at birth suggests deficient testosterone production in the third trimester. A history of bilateral cryptorchidism is usually associated with diminished spermatogenesis and sometimes with low testosterone in adulthood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-sexual-development#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal sexual development&quot;, section on 'Development of the male phenotype'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=undescended-testes-cryptorchidism-in-children-clinical-features-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Undescended testes (cryptorchidism) in children: Clinical features and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prepubertal</strong> &ndash; When the onset of testosterone deficiency occurs at any time after birth during the first decade, the result is failure to undergo or complete puberty. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of delayed puberty&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adult </strong>&ndash; When testosterone deficiency first occurs after completion of puberty, symptoms may include a decrease in energy and libido that occurs within days to weeks. However, sexual hair, muscle mass, and bone mineral density usually do not diminish to a significant degree for several years, although profound deficiency may cause a more rapid decline. Adults may also present with infertility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-osteoporosis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of osteoporosis in men&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-male-infertility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of male infertility&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H307827\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because testosterone affects many tissues, lack of testosterone can cause many different symptoms. In adults, the symptoms are likely to be worse if the hypogonadism develops over the course of weeks or months than slowly over years.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adolescents and young adults who have not yet completed puberty appear younger than their chronologic age. They may also present with small genitalia, difficulty gaining muscle mass in spite of vigorous exercise, lack of a beard, and failure of the voice to deepen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of delayed puberty&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adult men, several common but nonspecific symptoms begin within a few weeks of the onset of testosterone deficiency: decreased vigor and libido, and depressed mood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Decreased muscle mass and body hair are less common, but do not occur for a year or many years. Hot flashes occur only when the degree of hypogonadism is severe and especially when the rate of fall is rapid. Gynecomastia, tender or not, is more likely to occur in primary than secondary hypogonadism, as is infertility.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of signs on physical examination that provide strong evidence of hypogonadism. The physical examination should focus first on whether or not the patient is normally virilized and has normal genitalia. If either is abnormal, the exam should then be directed toward clues as to whether the hypogonadism is primary or secondary and if it began before or after puberty.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Males who develop hypogonadism before the onset of puberty and are not treated do not develop body hair and a beard characteristic of other men in the family, temporal hair recession, full male musculature, or deep voice. Men who develop hypogonadism after puberty may lose these characteristics if the hypogonadism is severe enough <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> of sufficient duration, usually years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Males who develop hypogonadism before the onset of puberty have small testes (&lt;20 mL) and a small phallus (&lt;8 cm) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76165\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76165 \">table 4</a>). If hypogonadism develops after puberty, the testes usually decrease in size if the hypogonadism is primary, which preferentially damages the seminiferous tubules, but they usually do not decrease to a recognizable degree if it is secondary. The phallus does not decrease in size.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gynecomastia, the presence of glandular breast tissue in a male, is more likely to occur in primary than secondary hypogonadism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-causes-of-gynecomastia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and causes of gynecomastia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-gynecomastia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and evaluation of gynecomastia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Finding eunuchoid proportions in an adult male at any age indicates that the hypogonadism developed prepubertally. Eunuchoid proportions include a lower body segment (floor to pubis) that is more than 2 cm longer than upper body segment (pubis to crown), and an arm span that is more than 5 cm longer than height. In comparison, a normal adult male has approximately equal upper and lower body segments as well as arm span and height. The absence of testosterone (and as a result, estradiol) during puberty causes a delay in epiphyseal closure so that the continued presence of growth hormone results in an increase in the length of the long bones. This relationship persists even after testosterone treatment.</p><p/><p>While the presence of physical findings provides evidence of hypogonadism, their absence in an adult is less helpful, because regression of secondary sexual characteristics, such as body hair and muscle mass, may not occur for years after the onset of hypogonadism. Consequently, men with symptoms of hypogonadism should be evaluated by appropriate laboratory tests even in the absence of physical findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13715963\"><span class=\"h2\">Biochemical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the biochemical features of hypogonadism in the adult male include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has primary hypogonadism if the serum testosterone concentration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the sperm count are below normal and the serum LH <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> FSH concentrations are above normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient has secondary hypogonadism if the serum testosterone concentration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the sperm count are subnormal and the serum LH <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> FSH concentrations are normal or low.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H219147875\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is based upon the presence of signs and symptoms of male hypogonadism and unequivocally low serum total testosterone concentrations between 8 and 10 AM on at least two occasions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F97611\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97611 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H219147882\"><span class=\"h2\">Candidates for testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Population screening for male hypogonadism has not been shown to be cost-effective and is not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Instead, we suggest case detection by measuring serum testosterone in situations in which the prevalence of hypogonadism is high, as suggested by the Endocrine Society guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diseases of the sellar region</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications that affect testosterone production, such as high-dose glucocorticoids for a prolonged period and sustained-release opioids</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated weight loss</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>End-stage renal disease and maintenance hemodialysis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive lung disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infertility</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteoporosis or low-trauma fracture, especially in a young man</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 2 diabetes mellitus</p><p/><p>Men with acute or subacute illness should not be assessed for hypogonadism, as they will have a transient functional secondary hypogonadism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H343867262\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation and diagnosis of male hypogonadism are usually straightforward. The clinician obtains clues to the possible presence of hypogonadism from the history and physical examination and confirms the diagnosis by appropriate laboratory testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F97611\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97611 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Initial laboratory testing is based upon measuring the products of the testes (testosterone and sperm) and the pituitary hormones that control their production (luteinizing hormone [LH] and follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]). Testosterone is produced by the Leydig cells of the testes under stimulation of LH. Sperm are produced in the seminiferous tubules under stimulation principally by the high concentration of testosterone in the testes but also by FSH. Testosterone, in turn, inhibits both LH and FSH secretion, the latter via conversion to estradiol. FSH is also inhibited by inhibin, a product of the Sertoli cells of the seminiferous tubules.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H219147889\"><span class=\"h3\">Serum total testosterone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of the serum testosterone concentration is usually the most important single test in the evaluation of male hypogonadism because a low value usually indicates hypogonadism. Three aspects of testosterone measurement should be considered: what form (total or free), when during the day, and how often should serum testosterone be measured (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F97611\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97611 \">algorithm 1</a>)?</p><p>Measurement of the serum total (free plus protein-bound) testosterone concentration is usually an accurate reflection of testosterone secretion. The normal range in adult men in most laboratories is about 300 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H146496241\"><span class=\"h4\">Effect of abnormal SHBG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of the serum free testosterone concentration is worthwhile only when it is suspected that an abnormality in testosterone binding to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) coexists with hypogonadism.</p><p>The two most common situations of abnormal testosterone binding are obesity, which decreases SHBG concentrations in proportion to the degree of obesity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F58970\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58970 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and male aging, which increases SHBG slightly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Obesity decreases the serum concentration of SHBG, thereby decreasing the serum total testosterone concentration usually without lowering the free testosterone concentration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F58970\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58970 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. The binding abnormality is proportional to the degree of obesity and is corrected by weight loss. However, severe obesity (body mass index [BMI] &gt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> may cause hypothalamic hypogonadism as well as the binding abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Measurement of the serum free testosterone in a laboratory capable of performing the equilibrium dialysis assay accurately will distinguish between a binding abnormality and hypogonadism in an obese male. (See <a href=\"#H146496247\" class=\"local\">'Free testosterone'</a> below.)</p><p>Although the serum total testosterone concentration falls slightly with increasing age, the serum free testosterone falls to a greater degree (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F58511\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58511 \">figure 3</a>). As a result, men who are 80 years old have values that are one-half to one-third of those in men who are 20 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. What is unknown now is if this fall represents a physiologic or a pathologic phenomenon. If it were pathologic, treatment with testosterone would be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-older-men-with-low-testosterone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to older men with low testosterone&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Causes of abnormal SHBG include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased SHBG concentrations: aging, hyperthyroidism, high estrogen concentrations, liver disease, HIV, antiseizure drugs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased SHBG concentrations: moderate obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism, growth hormone excess, exogenous <span class=\"nowrap\">androgens/anabolic</span> steroids, glucocorticoids, progestins, nephrotic syndrome</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H146496247\"><span class=\"h3\">Free testosterone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If serum free testosterone concentration is measured, the following points should be kept in mind:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum free testosterone should be performed by equilibrium dialysis and only in those few laboratories that specialize in endocrine testing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The free testosterone concentration, as calculated from the total testosterone, SHBG, and albumin concentrations, may also be reliable, but there are many different equations for this calculation and they give vastly different results, some of which reflect the results obtained by equilibrium dialysis better than others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Consequently, it is essential that the result be compared with the normal range for the laboratory that performed the assay.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Free testosterone measured by an analog method, which is the assay most commonly offered by hospital and commercial laboratories, does not correlate with the results of equilibrium dialysis. This test gives misleading information and should never be ordered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The problem with the analog method was illustrated in a study in which sera from patients who had a variety of SHBG concentrations were assayed by each of the above methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The results using each of the assays correlated well with the results using each of the other methods, except for free testosterone by the analog method, in which the results were both systematically lower than in the other methods and varied as a function of SHBG.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bioavailable testosterone, ie, the total of free testosterone and that bound weakly to albumin, which is not precipitated by ammonium sulfate, also appears to accurately reflect androgen status.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H219148432\"><span class=\"h3\">When during the day should the serum testosterone concentration be measured?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interpretation of serum testosterone measurements in young men should take into consideration its diurnal fluctuation, which reaches a maximum at about 8 AM and a minimum, approximately 70 percent of the maximum, at about 8 PM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F80568\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80568 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It is easier to distinguish subnormal from normal when normal is higher, so the measurements should always be made in the morning, ideally between 8 to 10 AM. Food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], especially glucose ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], also decreases the serum testosterone concentration, so the blood should also be drawn fasting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H219148439\"><span class=\"h3\">How often should testosterone be measured?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The serum testosterone concentration fluctuates somewhat even early in the morning, although to a limited degree. If a single 8 to 10 AM value is well within the normal range, testosterone production can be assumed to be normal. If a single 8 to 10 AM value is low or borderline low or does not fit with the clinical findings, the measurement should be repeated once or twice before making the diagnosis of hypogonadism. If the results are equivocal, measurement of free testosterone can be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1086181202\"><span class=\"h2\">LH and FSH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the serum testosterone is below normal on two occasions, a serum luteinizing hormone (LH) concentration should be measured to distinguish primary from secondary hypogonadism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F97611\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97611 \">algorithm 1</a>). Measuring basal serum concentrations of both LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) help to interpret subnormal values for serum testosterone and sperm count. However, a semen analysis is not part of the evaluation for all men presenting with hypogonadism, only those pursuing fertility or those with known infertility. The following patterns may be found:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the serum testosterone concentration is subnormal, supranormal serum LH and FSH concentrations (normal range for both approximately 1 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL</span> in most laboratories) indicate primary hypogonadism, and values that are not supranormal indicate secondary hypogonadism. Clearly elevated gonadotropin values are indicative of primary hypogonadism even if the serum testosterone concentration is in the low-normal range. Age probably causes some degree of secondary hypogonadism, so an elevated LH due to primary hypogonadism may not be as high in older men as in younger men.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some men with primary hypogonadism present with a subnormal sperm count, high serum FSH, but normal serum testosterone and LH concentrations.

These abnormalities may result from disease of the testes (primary hypogonadism) or disease of the pituitary or hypothalamus (secondary hypogonadism). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-primary-hypogonadism-in-males\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of primary hypogonadism in males&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-secondary-hypogonadism-in-males\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of secondary hypogonadism in males&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to undergo or complete puberty indicates deficient testosterone secretion.

Instead, we suggest case detection by measuring serum testosterone when hypogonadism is suspected, such as in those with sexual symptoms, osteoporosis-associated fractures, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated weight loss, those taking sustained-release opioids or high-dose glucocorticoids for prolonged periods, and those who are incompletely virilized or have small testes on examination. Men with acute or subacute illness should not be assessed for hypogonadism, as they will have a transient functional secondary hypogonadism. (See <a href=\"#H219147882\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To make the diagnosis of hypogonadism, we suggest measuring a morning serum <strong>total testosterone</strong> concentration between 8 and 10 AM. If a man is suspected of having an abnormality in testosterone binding to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), measurement of free testosterone by equilibrium dialysis should be performed. The two most common situations of abnormal testosterone binding are obesity, which decreases SHBG concentrations, and aging, which increases SHBG. (See <a href=\"#H146496241\" class=\"local\">'Effect of abnormal SHBG'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the testosterone is subnormal, it should be repeated, and serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating (FSH) concentrations should be measured to distinguish primary from secondary hypogonadism.
