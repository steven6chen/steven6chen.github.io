For some patients, the emotional trauma may be so severe as to lead to refusing or delaying treatment that might otherwise be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/2-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-8</a>]. Recovery generally requires a period of several months to a year, amplifying the psychological impact of the disease and its treatment.</p><p>A general overview of the anatomy and physiology of hair growth, the effects of chemotherapy on the hair follicle, and possible means for preventing or minimizing chemotherapy-induced alopecia are discussed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hair shaft is a layered structure that consists of three major components. The medulla, the innermost layer, is surrounded by the cortex and cuticle. The hair fiber is the product of the hair follicle, which is composed of three main parts when viewed in longitudinal section (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53952 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lower portion, which extends from the base of the hair follicle to the insertion of the arrector pili muscle. This lower portion, in turn, is comprised of several major components:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The hair bulb, which contains the dermal papilla and hair matrix. The dermal papilla controls the number of matrix cells, which determines hair fiber size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Melanocytes, which are responsible for hair color, are present among the matrix cells of the hair bulb.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The hair itself, consisting of medulla, cortex, and hair cuticle (inside to outside).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The inner root sheath, which consists of the inner root sheath cuticle, Huxley layer, and Henle layer (inside to outside). The inner root sheath is rigid, with its shape determining whether hair is curly or straight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The outer root sheath.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Damage to the lower portion of the hair follicle, as occurs in autoimmune alopecia areata, can result in a nonscarring alopecia. Immune-mediated alopecia areata can also be induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors that target cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">(PD-1)/programmed</span> cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

This portion contains the &quot;bulge&quot; of the hair follicle, where the epithelial stem cells reside [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Damage to the bulge of the hair follicle results in irreversible scarring alopecia, as is seen clinically in disorders such as discoid lupus and lichen planopilaris.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The upper portion (infundibulum), which extends from the entrance of the sebaceous duct to the follicular orifice.</p><p/><p>Once formed, hair follicles undergo lifelong cycling characterized by periods of growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and rest (telogen), after which time the hair is shed (also known as exogen). Approximately 80 to 90 percent of follicles at any given time are in the active growth phase (anagen). During anagen, mitotically active matrix cells in the hair bulb differentiate and divide, resulting in a rate of hair growth of approximately 0.35 mm per day. Approximately 5 to 10 percent of follicles are in telogen (dormancy), during which all mitotic activity is arrested (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F50528\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50528 \">figure 2</a>). The remaining 1 to 3 percent are in catagen, the involution phase. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss#H1871661\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;, section on 'Hair cycle'</a>.)</p><p>The final step of the hair cycle, exogen, is when the hair is released from the follicle. The scalp is estimated to contain on average 100,000 hairs, of which 100 to 150 are lost daily as part of the normal hair cycle. This loss typically occurs after washing and brushing the hair, so patients who wash their hair less frequently may note a greater number of hairs falling out at each instance.</p><p>Multiple signaling molecules have been implicated in the initial development and subsequent cycling of the hair follicle, including Wnt, sonic hedgehog, notch, and bone morphogenic proteins, among others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a mouse model of chemotherapy-induced alopecia, transient overexpression of sonic hedgehog accelerated hair follicle regrowth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytotoxic chemotherapy attacks rapidly dividing cells in the body, including the dividing hair matrix cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This can result in hair loss by either of two mechanisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F112426\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112426 \">figure 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If proliferation of the hair follicle matrix keratinocytes is severely inhibited, the hair may separate at the bulb and shed, a process referred to as anagen effluvium. Depending on the degree of toxicity on hair matrix keratinocytes, agents or schedules with lower toxicity will result in a dystrophic anagen effluvium, resulting in less alopecia and delayed hair regrowth; conversely, agents with greater toxicity will lead to severe alopecia but more rapid hair regrowth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss#H1871434\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;, section on 'Nonscarring alopecia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thinning of the hair shaft can occur at the time of maximal chemotherapy effect, resulting in Pohl-Pinkus constrictions. As a result, the hair shaft may break at the follicular orifice during the resting phase of the hair cycle. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss#H933990664\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;, section on 'Trichoscopy'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Reversibility of alopecia is related to the degree of damage to the hair follicle stem cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Because chemotherapy effects are typically specific for proliferating cells, which reside in the bulb, sparing the quiescent stem cells in the bulge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53952 \">figure 1</a>) that are responsible for reinitiating follicle growth, hair loss from chemotherapy is usually, but not always, completely reversible. (See <a href=\"#H217665997\" class=\"local\">'Recovery and reversibility'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1167826\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term alopecia refers to the partial or complete absence of hair from any area of the body where it normally grows. Chemotherapy-induced alopecia is most prominent on the scalp, with a predilection for areas with low total hair densities, in particular the crown and frontal areas of the scalp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], where there is also slower hair recovery. Total scalp alopecia is most common, but hair loss can be diffuse or patchy.</p><p>Loss of eyebrows and eyelashes, as well as axillary and pubic hair, is variable, and may even occur after the last dose of chemotherapy has been administered. However, recovery is generally more rapid than on the scalp.</p><p>The timing of hair loss depends on the type(s) of chemotherapy agents, dose, and schedule. For most regimens that are given every two to three weeks, hair loss starts around two weeks and is completely lost by the end of the second cycle of chemotherapy. Weekly chemotherapy generally results in slower and occasionally incomplete hair loss, and hair may actually start to grow back with continuing treatment. High-dose chemotherapy used in the setting of hematopoietic cell transplantation leads to rapid and complete hair loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Some chemotherapy agents may cause prolonged or permanent alopecia, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> given at doses of 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> or higher per cycle, although the true incidence is unknown (see <a href=\"#H217665997\" class=\"local\">'Recovery and reversibility'</a> below). It is important to advise patients about this risk before starting treatment with a specific regimen, as treatment alternatives may be available if patients are bothered by the possibility of permanent alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>].</p><p>Chemotherapy may have effects on the hair other than alopecia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a> and some targeted biologic agents may temporarily affect the follicle melanocytes, resulting in a depigmented band of hair (the so-called &quot;flag sign&quot;) and, in some cases, general depigmentation.

The hair follicle resumes normal cycling within a few weeks of treatment cessation, and visible regrowth becomes apparent within three to six months. The new hair frequently has different characteristics from the original; 65 percent of patients experience a graying, rejuvenating, curling, or straightening effect, which is likely due to differential effects of chemotherapy on hair follicle melanocytes and inner root sheath epithelia, and may resolve over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Permanent alopecia following chemotherapy is uncommon; most cases have followed the use of high-dose chemotherapy (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thiotepa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thiotepa</a>) and hematopoietic cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/42-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-46</a>].

Two such automated devices, the DigniCap and Paxman scalp hypothermia systems, have been used extensively outside of the United States, and the DigniCap device is now also US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared in the United States for this use. Manual caps are also available. (See <a href=\"#H3650458708\" class=\"local\">'Available devices and mechanism of benefit'</a> below.)</p><p>Although the evidence base is less robust, scalp hypothermia could also be discussed as a potential option for patients with other solid tumors who are receiving chemotherapy that is expected to result in significant alopecia. Patients considering scalp hypothermia should be counseled on the variable success of scalp hypothermia. In particular, rates of success are highly variable, and overall, less than 50 percent of patients keep at least 50 percent of their hair when receiving anthracyclines. In addition, there is a financial burden from scalp hypothermia that should be discussed with each patient, as well as the side effects of feeling cold and having mild headaches. (See <a href=\"#H3344577215\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy and safety'</a> below.)</p><p>We do not discuss the option of scalp hypothermia for patients with diseases associated with high levels of circulating tumor cells, such as leukemia and some types of lymphoma. Patients with solid tumors receiving continuous-infusion chemotherapy regimens over one day or longer that result in hair loss, and those undergoing cranial irradiation are also not good candidates for scalp hypothermia. Individuals with extreme sensitivity to cold or cold-induced migraines may not tolerate the cooling process. Scalp hypothermia is contraindicated in patients with cold agglutinin disease, cryoglobulinemia, and posttraumatic cold dystrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>] and should be used with caution in patients with liver dysfunction.

Automatic devices use a portable cooling unit that circulates a coolant in a flexible cap so that temperature is maintained within a narrow range. The current devices are able to cool two patients at the same time. Manual cooling involves insulated gel caps that are frozen in a cooler with dry ice or in a freezer (if available in the chemotherapy infusion center), fitted to the head, and then changed every 30 minutes as the temperature increases.</p><p>Regardless of the specific device that is used, cooling is started approximately 30 minutes before the chemotherapy infusion starts. Cooling is maintained for a period of time after the end of the chemotherapy infusion, generally between 90 and 120 minutes, although efficacy has been demonstrated with shorter post-cooling times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. Generally, an insulating cap is placed over the cold cap, and a protective covering is placed over the head between the scalp and cold cap. </p><p>Scalp hypothermia is thought to work by several mechanisms, including local vasoconstriction of blood vessels, resulting in reduced delivery of chemotherapy to the scalp, decreased follicle cell metabolic rate, and reduced cellular drug uptake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/2,56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,56-58</a>].</p><p>The optimal scalp temperature for successful cooling is debated; although some suggest that a scalp temperature of less than 22&ordm;C is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/53,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,59</a>], others attribute therapeutic success to obtaining a subcutaneous scalp temperature below 15&ordm;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The type of cooling device determines the temperature, as manual caps are colder when initially applied to the scalp to account for their gradual increase in temperature before a new cap is applied.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3344577215\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy and safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scalp hypothermia has been used in more than 30 countries as a mechanism to prevent chemotherapy-induced alopecia, with variable success reported depending on the specific cooling device and type of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/53,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,61</a>]. In general, cooling has been overall less effective when used with combination anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens, although this is dependent on dose and schedule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/25,26,62-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26,62-65</a>]. </p><p>Results of many older studies are difficult to interpret secondary to the use of multiple cooling systems (ice turban, gel packs, cool caps, thermocirculator, room air conditioner), variable chemotherapy regimens (single versus combined agents), small study populations, retrospective evaluations, and varying definitions of alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/2,3,61,66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,61,66,67</a>].

In general, between 50 and 80 percent of patients are reported to have a good to excellent response (defined variably as the degree of hair loss or not using a head covering) to scalp hypothermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/2,62,68-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,62,68-74</a>]. A meta-analysis in 2015 concluded that scalp hypothermia was the only intervention that significantly reduced the risk of chemotherapy-induced alopecia (10 studies, including three randomized trials, relative risk 0.38, 95% CI 0.32-0.45) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. No significant adverse events associated with scalp hypothermia were reported in the meta-analysis.

Hair loss was measured using the Dean Scale, with success defined as hair loss of 50 percent or less (Dean score 0 to 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F112011\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112011 \">table 2</a>)) one month after the last chemotherapy infusion, and was graded by the patients using photographs compared with baseline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hair loss was 50 percent or less in 66.3 percent of the intervention group compared with none of the control group (p&lt;0.001).

The primary toxicity was mild headache, and three patients stopped cooling due to feeling cold. Preliminary results of this study led to FDA clearance of this scalp hypothermia device for patients with breast cancer in December of 2015, and an expansion of the clinical indications of that clearance to cover all solid tumors in July 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second trial randomly assigned 182 patients in a 2 to 1 ratio to use of the Paxman cooling device or no scalp hypothermia during chemotherapy for breast cancer; 36 percent received anthracycline-based chemotherapy, while the remainder received a taxane, either alone or combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pertuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pertuzumab</a>, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].

Interestingly, in this study, there were substantial differences in the success of cooling by site and by drug group. An exploratory post hoc analysis indicated that only 16 percent of patients receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy met criteria for success, compared with 59 percent of those receiving taxanes, although the confidence intervals were very wide. Seven patients discontinued cooling early, primarily due to feeling cold. The Paxman device is currently under FDA review in the United States.</p><p/><p>Scalp hypothermia using the DigniCap automated device is now available in a number of centers, and the manual caps are available to rent. Some infusion centers have freezers available to assist with freezing the caps. Manual caps have the disadvantage of needing to be refrozen (as well as being stored in a refrigerator in between freezing sessions), and the need for an additional person to change the cap every 30 minutes during and after chemotherapy.</p><p>Side effects of scalp hypothermia are generally mild and include patient discomfort from feeling cold, headache, nausea, dry skin, scalp thermal injury with manual caps, and claustrophobia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/69,73,75,76,78-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,73,75,76,78-81</a>]. It has been suggested that use of scalp hypothermia may result in faster regrowth of hair following the end of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Although this is not well documented, certainly retaining some hair at the end of chemotherapy could simply be associated with a shorter time to having &quot;acceptable&quot; hair growth.</p><p>Questions remain regarding the cost of scalp hypothermia devices and who will pay for these interventions. The cost of the devices varies depending on the duration of chemotherapy and the type of cooling device used, but the average total cost for scalp hypothermia is estimated to range between USD $1500 and $3000 per patient depending on the number of treatment cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In addition, there may be institutional costs associated with extra time in the chemotherapy infusion center and additional personnel costs. In the United States, scalp hypothermia is not yet covered by health insurance, creating financial concerns and variable costs for patients. One philanthropic organization provides some financial assistance to those who cannot afford scalp hypothermia (hairtostay.org), but it is hoped that insurance coverage will change in the near future with the availability of newer efficacy and safety data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2195641479\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications and contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scalp hypothermia has been used successfully in patients with a variety of solid tumors receiving potentially curative chemotherapy regimens that are associated with a high risk of complete alopecia, including breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers.

However, the evidence for benefit is most robust in patients treated for breast cancer.</p><p>In terms of chemotherapy regimens, the success of scalp hypothermia is variable, particularly in patients receiving an anthracycline-based combination; overall, less than 50 percent of patients receiving anthracyclines in combination keep at least 50 percent of their hair. However, this may be acceptable to some patients, and the success may be very good in a minority.</p><p>The mechanism underlying the benefit of scalp hypothermia at least in part involves reduced delivery of chemotherapy to the scalp. (See <a href=\"#H3650458708\" class=\"local\">'Available devices and mechanism of benefit'</a> above.) </p><p>Previously, some investigators have raised concerns regarding the possibility of scalp metastasis in association with scalp hypothermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/2,3,56,57,68,70,78,85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,56,57,68,70,78,85,86</a>]. The incidence of scalp metastases with use of scalp hypothermia devices has been best studied in breast cancer, where the risk of scalp metastases is very low, and these are often discovered either along with or following a diagnosis of systemic disease. As an example, in one study of 61 patients with disseminated breast cancer receiving chemotherapy using a cooling cap, one patient with underlying liver dysfunction developed cutaneous scalp metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, larger studies evaluating patients using scalp hypothermia during chemotherapy for early stage breast cancer have shown no association between use of a cooling device and the subsequent development of scalp metastases, and one large study showed no impact of scalp hypothermia on survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/86-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-88</a>]. In one review, the incidence of scalp skin metastases in breast cancer patients was comparable for scalp-cooled (0.04 to 1 percent) and non-scalp-cooled patients (0.03 to 3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. A systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated 1959 patients using scalp cooling devices over an estimated mean time frame of 43.1&nbsp;months and 1238 patients who did not use a scalp cooling device over an estimated mean time frame of 87.4&nbsp;months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. The incidence rate of&nbsp;scalp&nbsp;metastasis&nbsp;in the&nbsp;scalp&nbsp;cooling group versus the no&nbsp;scalp&nbsp;cooling group was 0.61 (95% CI 0.32-1.1 percent) versus 0.41 percent (95% CI 0.13-0.94 percent); p&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.43. In the DigniCap study described above, no patient has developed scalp metastases at a median follow-up of 2.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>We do not recommend scalp hypothermia for patients with diseases associated with high levels of circulating tumor cells, such as leukemia and some types of lymphoma. One group reported the outcome of a patient with mycosis fungoides who used a cooling cap to prevent alopecia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Following chemotherapy, he developed recurrent disease limited to the scalp. Subsequent treatment without a cooling device resulted in complete clinical remission. Although mycosis fungoides is a disease that is primarily manifested in skin, there remains concern about treating patients with diseases associated with high levels of circulating tumor cells, such as leukemia and some types of lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. In addition, these diseases are usually treated with high doses of chemotherapy, where scalp hypothermia is unlikely to be effective. </p><p>Patients with solid tumors receiving continuous-infusion chemotherapy regimens over one day or longer that result in hair loss are also not good candidates for scalp hypothermia. </p><p>Finally, it does not appear that scalp hypothermia can prevent radiation-induced hair loss, and these patients are not good candidates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>Scalp hypothermia is contraindicated in patients with cold agglutinin disease, cryoglobulinemia, and posttraumatic cold dystrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>] and should be used with caution due to reported poorer efficacy in patients with liver dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chemotherapy-induced-alopecia/abstract/2,3,56,58,66,70,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,56,58,66,70,78</a>].

Systemically administered EGF protected rats from cytarabine-induced but not cyclophosphamide-induced alopecia, while topical application of EGF prevented alopecia at the site of administration only.

A wide range of chemotherapy agents can affect the growing cells of the hair follicle. The frequency and severity of alopecia varies depending upon the specific chemotherapy agent or combination regimen administered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F112007\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112007 \">table 3</a>), the dose of the drugs, and the treatment schedule. The majority of chemotherapy-induced alopecia is reversible once therapy is discontinued, with the possible exception of some molecularly targeted therapies. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Effects of chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hair loss is generally most prominent on the scalp, and there is a predilection for areas that show low total hair densities, in particular the crown and vertex. All patients who will receive chemotherapy that may result in alopecia should be informed of the side effect of hair loss. Options such as head wraps, hats, or wigs should be discussed in advance so that the patient can be more physically and emotionally prepared. For patients who are receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> at doses higher than 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> per dose, it is important to advise patients about the risk of prolonged or permanent alopecia. (See <a href=\"#H1167826\" class=\"local\">'Clinical characteristics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H217665997\" class=\"local\">'Recovery and reversibility'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scalp hypothermia minimizes delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to the scalp and reduces metabolism of the hair follicle cell, thereby decreasing the risk of hair loss. Prospective studies in breast cancer confirm that several devices can reduce or prevent hair loss in a majority of patients receiving taxane-based chemotherapy, with lower success rates seen in those receiving anthracycline-based regimens. Although previous concerns arose regarding the potential risk of scalp metastases, newer studies and a review of all available published data have failed to substantiate this concern. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Scalp hypothermia (scalp cooling)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For women with breast cancer who are receiving chemotherapy that is expected to result in significant alopecia and who place a high value on avoiding chemotherapy-induced alopecia, we suggest the use of a scalp hypothermia device (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). Two such automated devices, the DigniCap and Paxman scalp hypothermia systems, have been used extensively outside of the United States, and the DigniCap device is now also US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared in the United States for this use. Manual caps are also available. (See <a href=\"#H3650458708\" class=\"local\">'Available devices and mechanism of benefit'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although the evidence base is less robust, scalp hypothermia could also be discussed as a potential option for patients with other solid tumors who are receiving chemotherapy that is expected to result in significant alopecia. Patients considering scalp hypothermia should be counseled on the variable success of this approach. In particular, rates of success in patients receiving anthracycline-based combination therapy are highly variable, and overall, less than 50 percent of patients keep at least 50 percent of their hair. In addition, there is a financial burden from scalp hypothermia that should be discussed with each patient, as well as the side effects of feeling cold and having mild headaches. (See <a href=\"#H3344577215\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy and safety'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We do not discuss the option of scalp hypothermia for patients with diseases associated with high levels of circulating tumor cells, such as leukemia and some types of lymphoma. Patients with solid tumors receiving continuous infusion chemotherapy regimens over one day or longer that result in hair loss, and those undergoing cranial irradiation are also not good candidates for scalp hypothermia. Individuals with extreme sensitivity to cold or cold-induced migraines are also not ideal candidates. Scalp hypothermia is contraindicated in patients with cold agglutinin disease, cryoglobulinemia, and posttraumatic cold dystrophy and should be used with caution in patients with liver dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H2195641479\" class=\"local\">'Indications and contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preliminary studies suggest that a variety of both small molecules and biologic agents may reduce or prevent alopecia by protecting the hair bulb from the damaging effects of chemotherapy. However, to date, there are no specific pharmacologic interventions that have demonstrated consistent enough activity in randomized trials in humans to justify their general use to prevent chemotherapy-induced alopecia. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bimatoprost-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bimatoprost</a> could be considered for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced eyelash alopecia in patients who are bothered by this temporary side effect, there are no data supporting a preventive benefit and no data to suggest there is risk associated with use.
