It results from deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (also known as glucosylceramide or acid beta-glucosidase [GBA]). Glucosylceramide (also called glucocerebroside) and several related compounds that ordinarily are degraded to glucose and lipid components by glucocerebrosidase accumulate within the lysosomes of cells in patients with GD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Treatment of GD is tailored to the individual patient because of the variability in the manifestations, severity, and progression of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-treatment/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. GD is one of the few inherited metabolic disorders for which enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT) is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-treatment/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Additional therapies include substrate-reduction therapy (SRT) and supportive care measures to manage associated conditions.</p><p>The treatment of GD is discussed here. The pathogenesis, genetics, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, initial assessment, and routine monitoring are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gaucher-disease-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gaucher disease: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gaucher-disease-initial-assessment-monitoring-and-clinical-course\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gaucher disease: Initial assessment, monitoring, and clinical course&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPEUTIC GOALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basic goals of treatment are elimination or improvement of symptoms, prevention of irreversible complications, and improvement in the overall health and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-treatment/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. An additional goal in children is optimization of growth. An international panel of clinicians with extensive clinical experience in GD has developed a list of therapeutic goals for use as guides for optimal treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75418\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75418 \">table 1</a>). Regular monitoring is performed to assess the response to therapy, make adjustments when goals are not met, and ensure the maintenance of achieved goals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57808\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57808 \">table 2</a>). The goal of minimal disease activity, based upon the three major systemic domains involved (hematologic, visceral, and skeletal), is another possible treatment target [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The frequency of reevaluation depends upon disease severity and should be assessed on an individual basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gaucher-disease-initial-assessment-monitoring-and-clinical-course\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gaucher disease: Initial assessment, monitoring, and clinical course&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Visceral, hematologic, skeletal, and other aspects of nonneuronopathic disease are considered separately since each of these components is relatively independent of the others with respect to disease burden and response to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Skeletal manifestations are associated with the greatest morbidity and, once present, are among the least responsive to enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT). ERT may slow or prevent progression of skeletal complications, but osteonecrosis, osteosclerosis, and vertebral compression are irreversible. Early treatment may prevent or lessen the severity of these complications, and therefore, early identification is crucial to improving ultimate outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-treatment/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

ERT with a recombinant glucocerebrosidase (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiglucerase-glucocerebrosidase-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">imiglucerase</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=velaglucerase-alfa-glucocerebrosidase-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">velaglucerase alfa</a>, or taliglucerase alpha; the last is not approved for use in the European Union) or SRT with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eliglustat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eliglustat</a> are the preferred treatments for patients with clinically significant manifestations of nonneuronopathic GD (GD1). ERT with imiglucerase or velaglucerase (off-label use) is also an option in patients with chronic neuronopathic GD (type 3 [GD3]) who have visceral manifestations and in patients at risk for GD3, but it is not suitable for patients with acute neuronopathic GD (type 2 [GD2]) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50695\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50695 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-treatment/abstract/6,14-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14-20</a>].

These recommendations are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50695\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50695 \">table 3</a>). In brief, ERT with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiglucerase-glucocerebrosidase-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">imiglucerase</a> should be considered for patients with GD3 disease and severe visceral symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-treatment/abstract/24,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,28</a>].

ERT may also have palliative effects on visceral manifestations in GD2 disease, but it does not alter the fatal neurologic outcome and therefore is generally not used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-treatment/abstract/27,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiglucerase-glucocerebrosidase-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Imiglucerase</a> is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese hamster ovary cell system, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=velaglucerase-alfa-glucocerebrosidase-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">velaglucerase alfa</a> by gene activation technology in a human cell line, and taliglucerase alpha by a novel plant cell-based protein expression system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-treatment/abstract/17-20,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20,31-33</a>]. The purified enzyme imiglucerase is a monomeric glycoprotein composed of 497 amino acids. Recombinant enzyme differs from the native form and the therapeutic placental form (alglucerase) by a histidine for arginine amino acid substitution at position 495 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Oligosaccharide chains at the glycosylation sites are modified by sequential deglycosylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] to terminate in mannose moieties. Mannose groups are specifically recognized by endocytic receptors, allowing uptake of the enzyme by the cell and trafficking to the lysosome. Velaglucerase differs from imiglucerase insomuch as the enzyme protein sequence is the native human sequence and greater mannose display is achieved. Kifunensine, a mannosidase I inhibitor, is used in the medium during production to obtain the desired glycosylation profile. The inhibition of the natural maturation of the glycans generates predominantly high mannose-type oligosaccharides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gaucher-disease-treatment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The taliglucerase platform uses genetically modified carrot cells.

An additional goal in children is optimization of growth and development. Treatment of GD is tailored to the individual patient because of the variability in the manifestations, severity, and progression of the disease. An international panel of clinicians with extensive clinical experience in GD has developed a list of therapeutic goals to be used as guides for optimal individualized treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75418\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75418 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic goals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision to offer enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT) or substrate-reduction therapy (SRT) in nonneuronopathic (type 1) GD (GD1) is based upon disease severity, as determined by the initial assessment, or significant disease progression, as demonstrated through regular follow-up (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57808\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57808 \">table 2</a>). We recommend ERT with recombinant glucocerebrosidases (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiglucerase-glucocerebrosidase-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">imiglucerase</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=velaglucerase-alfa-glucocerebrosidase-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">velaglucerase alfa</a>, or taliglucerase) for all symptomatic children and for patients with severe manifestations of nonneuronopathic GD1 (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). SRT with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eliglustat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eliglustat</a> is a suitable alternative for adults with symptomatic disease and suitable metabolizer status. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Nonneuronopathic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment options for adult patients with GD1 include SRT with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eliglustat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eliglustat</a> or ERT. The choice is likely to be largely based upon patient preference. Dosing of eliglustat is determined by metabolizer status. A small number of adult patients who metabolize eliglustat more quickly or at an undetermined rate are not eligible for treatment with this drug. SRT with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=miglustat-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">miglustat</a>, an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, is an option in adult patients with mild to moderate GD1 who are unwilling or unable to receive ERT. The recommended dose of miglustat is 100 mg orally three times per day. Patients treated with miglustat should be monitored for emergent neuropathy. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Substrate-reduction therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Enzyme-replacement therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest ERT for patients with neuronopathic type 3 disease and severe visceral symptoms (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). In addition, we suggest ERT in patients at risk for neuronopathic type 3 GD (GD3) due to genotype or family history who are identified early in the disease course, before the onset of neurologic signs or symptoms (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We suggest <strong>not</strong> administering ERT in patients with type 2 disease (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). ERT may have palliative effects on visceral manifestations in patients with type 2 disease, but it does not alter the fatal neurologic outcome. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Neuronopathic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ERT is individualized. Factors considered in choosing the initial dose include age at presentation, comorbid conditions, the site(s) and extent of involvement, and the presence of irreversible pathology. For most patients, we use an initial dose of 30 to 60 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> intravenously every two weeks. The minimum recommended starting dose for children is 30 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span>. Treatment response varies, but, in general, improvements occur within six months after initiation of therapy and include reduction of spleen and liver volumes, resolution of thrombocytopenia and anemia, and reduction in fatigue. Improvement in skeletal disease may not be evident for two to three years. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Administration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine monitoring of disease activity is performed during ERT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57808\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57808 \">table 2</a>). Dose adjustments are made on an individual basis. We advise increasing the dose if visceromegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and biomarkers fail to improve after six months or if the patient fails to achieve specific therapeutic goals. We advise increasing the dose by 50 percent if bone crises continue. We suggest that dose reductions be considered only after all relevant therapeutic goals have been met. Dose reductions must be accompanied by reassessment of disease severity to ensure the maintenance of therapeutic goals. Treatment is continued throughout the patient's life. Treatment interruptions are not recommended. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Administration'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gaucher-disease-initial-assessment-monitoring-and-clinical-course\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gaucher disease: Initial assessment, monitoring, and clinical course&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The availability and efficacy of ERT have limited the indications for splenectomy and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HSCT). Splenectomy is indicated if other measures fail to control life-threatening thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow transplantation may be an option in patients known to be at-risk for neuronopathic disease who present early in the disease course.
