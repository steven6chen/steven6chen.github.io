However, many authors continue to utilize the term eosinophilic granuloma of bone; thus, this latter terminology is still both historically and clinically relevant.</p><p>This topic review will discuss LCH of the bone in children.

Patients with single bone lesions have a mean age of 5.5 years and those with multiple bone lesions 4.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/langerhans-cell-histiocytosis-eosinophilic-granuloma-of-bone-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In childhood presentations, prevalence is greater in males (male:female ratio of 1.1:2.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/langerhans-cell-histiocytosis-eosinophilic-granuloma-of-bone-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

This distribution is in contrast to that of children, in whom the skull was the major bone area involved (40 percent), and the jaw was less often involved (8 percent).</p><p>Clinically, patients with LCH of the bone present with painful swelling at the affected bony site with or without decreased range of motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/langerhans-cell-histiocytosis-eosinophilic-granuloma-of-bone-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

An associated soft tissue mass may be present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64763\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64763 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>Skull lesions classically have a punched-out, lytic appearance.

A central radiodensity in a lytic lesion has been described as a button sequestrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/langerhans-cell-histiocytosis-eosinophilic-granuloma-of-bone-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Spinal lesions typically involve the vertebral body; pedicular and posterior element involvement are less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/langerhans-cell-histiocytosis-eosinophilic-granuloma-of-bone-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18</a>]. LCH in the spine may present as a lytic lesion or, alternatively, may present with abnormal flattening of the vertebral body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/langerhans-cell-histiocytosis-eosinophilic-granuloma-of-bone-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18</a>]. Extensive flattening of an entire vertebral body may assume a &quot;coin on edge&quot; appearance, known as vertebra plana (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77564\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77564 \">image 2</a>).

The intervertebral disc is normal or slightly widened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/langerhans-cell-histiocytosis-eosinophilic-granuloma-of-bone-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Mandibular involvement can simulate the appearance of &quot;floating&quot; teeth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/langerhans-cell-histiocytosis-eosinophilic-granuloma-of-bone-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>LCH is typically &quot;hot&quot; on radionuclide bone scans, but can be normal. Radiography and scintigraphy are complementary in this disorder, in that a radionuclide bone scan can detect some lesions poorly visualized by radiography. The extent of destructive lesions involving the orbit, mastoid, and vertebrae can be best defined by computed tomography (CT) scanning.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of bone lesions show the lytic lesion, often an intramedullary mass, with high T2 and low T1-weighted imaging that may break through the bone cortex. Bone marrow edema may extend beyond the boundary of the lytic lesion. Use of gadolinium contrast will demonstrate enhancement of the lesion and often soft tissue components. Sometimes extraosseous soft tissues next to the bone lesion will also have enhancement.</p><p>The &quot;activity&quot; of lesions may be judged subjectively by MRI or positron emission tomography (PET) scanning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/langerhans-cell-histiocytosis-eosinophilic-granuloma-of-bone-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The efficacy of PET scans in localizing sites of LCH as well as other sites of LCH in 44 patients has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/langerhans-cell-histiocytosis-eosinophilic-granuloma-of-bone-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Biopsy of suspicious lesions and staining for CD1a <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anti-langerin (CD207) is needed in order to confirm the diagnosis. Electron microscopy to identify Birbeck granules is performed less frequently because of time and expense. However, in the case of central nervous system (CNS) lesions or diagnostic dilemmas, it may be a critical test for confirming the diagnosis. Testing the lesion for the BRAF mutation may have clinical utility if the patient needs targeted therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/langerhans-cell-histiocytosis-eosinophilic-granuloma-of-bone-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

It is most common in children 5 to 10 years of age. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presentation of LCH with a single bone lesion is more common than multiple bone lesions. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bones most commonly affected in children include the skull, ribs, pelvis, long bones, mandible, and vertebrae.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with LCH present with painful swelling at the affected bony site with or without decreased range of motion. Pathologic fracture or spinal cord compression may also occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other presentations include the following (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Special presentations'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Proptosis due to a tumor mass behind the eye</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pain in the jaw and loose teeth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Refractory otitis media or hearing loss due to LCH involving the temporal bone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lesions involving the orbit, sphenoid, mastoid, or temporal bones are considered &quot;central nervous system (CNS) risk&quot; lesions and are associated with an increased risk for diabetes insipidus and other CNS disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and causes of central diabetes insipidus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Higher risk patients'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy of suspicious lesions and staining for CD1a <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anti-langerin (CD207) is needed in order to confirm the diagnosis of LCH. Electron microscopy to identify Birbeck granules is performed less frequently. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preferred treatment depends upon disease extent and the presence of CNS risk lesions:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Solitary lesions &ndash; There is no universally accepted protocol for the treatment of solitary LCH lesions that do not involve the orbit, mastoid, or temporal bones. Past strategies have utilized observation only, surgical curettage, radiation therapy, steroid injections, and chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Solitary bone lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Higher risk lesions &ndash; Lesions involving the orbit, sphenoid, mastoid, or temporal bones (&quot;CNS risk&quot; lesions) and multifocal bone lesions do better when treated with two drugs (eg, the LCH-III trial involving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinblastine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinblastine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> for six months), the standard of care for children, rather than with surgery, radiotherapy, or single agent chemotherapy.
