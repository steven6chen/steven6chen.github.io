A retrospective analysis described the outcomes of 212 patients with aplastic anemia who were transplanted in Seattle between 1970 and 1993 and who survived for at least two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-idiopathic-severe-aplastic-anemia-and-fanconi-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) emerged as a dominant risk factor for late complications. Survival probabilities at 20 years were 69 and 89 percent for patients with and without chronic GVHD, respectively. Seventeen patients died at 2 to 20 years post-transplant; 13 of them (76 percent) had chronic GVHD. In addition, carcinoma of the oropharyngeal mucosa occurred exclusively in patients with chronic GVHD.</p><p>Other complications included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression &ndash; 19 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone and joint problems &ndash; 18 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin problems &ndash; 14 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cataracts &ndash; 12 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Solid tumor malignancy &ndash; 12 percent (mostly squamous cell carcinoma)</p><p/><p>An encouraging observation from this study was that at two years post-transplant, approximately 83 percent of patients had returned to school or work; this number increased to 90 percent by 20 years. Patients rated their quality of life as excellent and symptoms as minimal or mild, and the majority of those surviving beyond two years returned to a fully functional life.</p><p>A second publication from the Seattle group described late effects among 152 children with aplastic anemia who survived for more than one year post-HCT and were followed for a median of 21.8 years (range: 1 to 38) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-idiopathic-severe-aplastic-anemia-and-fanconi-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estimated 30-years survivals were 82 and 58 percent for those transplanted for idiopathic aplastic anemia or Fanconi anemia (FA), respectively.

A Karnofsky performance score of less than 90 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 \">table 1</a>) was noted in 12 percent of survivors in this group.

Clonal and myeloproliferative disorders appear to be more common with immunosuppressive therapy. A report from the Severe Aplastic Anaemia Working Party of the European Blood and Marrow Transplantation estimated a 10-year incidence of malignancy, mostly myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute leukemia, of 19 percent in 860 patients treated with immunosuppressive therapy (5.2 times the overall cancer risk in an age-matched population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-idiopathic-severe-aplastic-anemia-and-fanconi-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. A much lower value, 3 percent, consisting primarily of solid tumors, was seen after HCT. The incidence of solid tumors was similar with the two procedures, but hematologic malignancy was much less common after bone marrow transplantation. The latter finding in part reflects the increased risk of MDS and acute leukemia associated with FA itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-idiopathic-severe-aplastic-anemia-and-fanconi-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].

Twenty-three patients developed a malignancy at a median of 91 months after the transplant. They included five lymphoid malignancies (which occurred early; median, three months) and 18 solid tumors (which occurred late; median, 99 months). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the malignancy risk was 14 percent at 20 years. Risk factors for solid tumors identified in univariate analysis included the underlying diagnosis of FA, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> therapy for chronic GVHD, and radiation therapy (TBI or total abdominal irradiation) in the preparative regimen. No case of myeloproliferative disease was observed.</p><p>In multivariate, stepwise proportional hazards models, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> therapy and the diagnosis of FA were significant risk factors for all patients. If only non-Fanconi patients were considered, azathioprine therapy, age, and irradiation were significant factors. Because azathioprine is no longer routinely used in the treatment of GVHD and conditioning regimens that do not use irradiation are now the standard for matched sibling transplants, a reasonable expectation is that the risk of new malignancies will decrease in subsequent cohorts of patients.</p><p>Results from the large EBMT study concerning the development of late malignancy are described above.
