The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune complex glomerulonephritis was present in 25, which was classified as membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) in 12, immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy in 7, and mesangial glomerulonephritis in 6 patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clinical renal abnormality (elevated serum creatinine, hematuria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proteinuria) was noted in only 10 patients, most of whom had MPGN.</p><p/><p>Posttransplant follow-up was not reported.

Affected patients typically present with nonspecific systemic symptoms, palpable purpura, arthralgias, fever, renal disease, neuropathy, and other manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The clinical manifestations of the renal disease may include hematuria, proteinuria (which may be in the nephrotic range), and renal impairment. A detailed discussion of the renal manifestations, including histologic findings, in patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome (essential mixed cryoglobulinemia)&quot;, section on 'Renal disease'</a>.)</p><p>Laboratory studies indicate the presence of hypocomplementemia and circulating cryoglobulins. The complement components, C3, C4, and C1q, are usually low; reductions in C4 are usually greater than reductions in C3. Cryoglobulins are most commonly type II, characterized by a polyclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) and monoclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM) kappa rheumatoid factor directed against the Fc portion of IgG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome (essential mixed cryoglobulinemia)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome (essential mixed cryoglobulinemia)&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Most patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome have HCV infection, and there is strong evidence that HCV-containing immune complexes are directly involved in the pathogenesis of disease. HCV RNA and HCV IgG antigen-antibody complexes are highly concentrated in the cryoprecipitate. In addition, HCV antigens have been detected along the glomerular capillary walls and in the mesangium of patients with HCV-related glomerulonephritis, mainly in those with MPGN and positive HCV RNA.

Type III cryoglobulinemia is characterized by circulating cryoglobulins comprised of polyclonal IgG and polyclonal IgM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-mixed-cryoglobulinemia-syndrome-essential-mixed-cryoglobulinemia#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome (essential mixed cryoglobulinemia)&quot;, section on 'Types of cryoglobulins'</a>.)</p><p>Histologic examination of kidney biopsies demonstrates glomerular infiltration by activated macrophages. The glomerular basement membrane shows double contours caused by the interposition of monocytes between the basement membrane and the endothelium. Subendothelial deposits of IgM, IgG, and complement components are observed by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. Vasculitis of small renal arteries is sometimes present.

Although such patients have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/13,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,25-27</a>], most of these patients subsequently developed measurable cryoglobulins, although not necessarily in conjunction with extrarenal manifestations of cryoglobulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/6,10,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,18</a>]. Circulating cryoglobulins are often difficult to detect, and cryoglobulinemia may be unrecognized in many patients.

Several small studies have suggested that membranous nephropathy may be induced by chronic HCV infection, although the data are conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/6,10,13,26,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,13,26,28,29</a>]. In one study, the prevalence of membranous nephropathy was significantly higher in HCV-positive compared with HCV-negative renal transplant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, in another study of 19 patients with membranous nephropathy, only 1 (5 percent) had anti-HCV antibodies, which was not different than that observed in control patients with diabetic nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Overall, these findings suggest but do not prove a possible role of HCV in the development of membranous nephropathy. However, in contrast to the findings in mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome or MPGN, complement levels tend to be normal, and neither cryoglobulins nor rheumatoid factor is present in HCV-associated membranous nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Polyarteritis nodosa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PAN is well described in patients with hepatitis B virus infection, but it also occurs in association with HCV in the absence of cryoglobulins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. In one series, among 161 patients with HCV-related vasculitis, 31 (19 percent) were diagnosed with PAN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This disorder is called secondary PAN.</p><p>In a review of 78 cases, the onset of PAN occurred at a mean of two years after the diagnosis of HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-c-virus-infection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The patients had typical symptoms of PAN and necrotizing inflammation of medium or small arteries in biopsy specimens.
