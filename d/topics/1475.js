It can be classified according to the pathophysiologic mechanism (eg, compressive atelectasis), the amount of lung involved (eg, lobar, segmental, or subsegmental atelectasis), or the location (ie, specific lobe or segment location). </p><p>The classification of atelectasis according to the pathophysiologic mechanism is reviewed here, as are the mechanisms of each type of atelectasis. Radiologic manifestations of atelectasis are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiologic-patterns-of-lobar-atelectasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiologic patterns of lobar atelectasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF ATELECTASIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atelectasis can be divided pathophysiologically into obstructive and nonobstructive atelectasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Obstructive atelectasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obstructive (ie, resorptive) atelectasis is a consequence of blockage of an airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-types-and-pathogenesis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Air retained distal to the occlusion is resorbed from nonventilated alveoli, causing the affected regions to become totally gasless and then collapse. The rate at which this occurs depends upon several factors, particularly the amount of collateral ventilation and the composition of inspired gas.</p><p>Obstruction of a segmental bronchus is less likely to result in segmental atelectasis than obstruction of a lobar bronchus is to produce lobar atelectasis. This difference is the consequence of collateral ventilation between segments within a lobe. Collateral ventilation occurs via three distinct channels (the pores of Kohn, canals of Lambert, and fenestrations of Boren) and all of these channels must be obliterated for obstructive atelectasis to occur. Such collateral ventilation does not occur between lobes, unless the interlobar fissures are incomplete (which is the case in &ge;50 percent of normal persons) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-types-and-pathogenesis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Of note, collateral ventilation is age-dependent:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children have poorly developed collateral pathways and, therefore, obstructive atelectasis can occur readily. This is why atelectasis is common in children who have aspirated a foreign body. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=airway-foreign-bodies-in-children#H32002736\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Airway foreign bodies in children&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, elderly adults with emphysema have extensive collateral ventilation through fenestrae of Boren, which are larger than the pores of Kohn. This explains why an obstructing lesion, such as a tumor, may have a long latent period in adults before it causes atelectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-types-and-pathogenesis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p>Patients who are breathing gas with a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) develop atelectasis more rapidly than patients who are breathing gas with a lower FiO<sub>2</sub>. Under normal conditions, the ambient air contains 79 percent inert nitrogen, which is in equilibrium with the nitrogen that is dissolved in pulmonary arteriolar and capillary blood. After complete occlusion of a bronchus, intraalveolar oxygen distal to the obstruction is rapidly reabsorbed along a steep pressure gradient into deoxygenated mixed venous blood. The pressure gradient forcing nitrogen into the mixed venous blood is minimal. Thus, nitrogen disappears slowly and acts like an alveolar splint or scaffolding, delaying the formation of atelectasis for several hours. In contrast, in patients who inhale gas with a high FiO<sub>2</sub>, the alveolar nitrogen is washed out. With less nitrogen in the alveoli at the moment of bronchial obstruction, atelectasis develops more rapidly, sometimes within minutes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonobstructive atelectasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonobstructive causes of atelectasis include loss of contact between the parietal and visceral pleurae, parenchymal compression, surfactant dysfunction, replacement of lung tissue by scarring or infiltrative disease, and strong vertical acceleration forces.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Relaxation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relaxation (ie, passive) atelectasis ensues when contact between the parietal and visceral pleurae is eliminated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-types-and-pathogenesis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. While this is usually due to a pleural effusion or pneumothorax, a large emphysematous bulla can have a similar effect. In this case, the residual physiologic elastic recoil of normal lung parenchyma allows the normal lung to pull away from the bulla with subsequent loss of volume.</p><p>Normal lung usually preserves its shape, even when its volume is decreased. This quality is called form elasticity and is the reason why relaxation atelectasis is more likely to be generalized than localized. Less frequently, the lobes of the lung may behave independently. As examples, the middle and lower lobes may shrink more than the upper lobe in the presence of a pleural effusion, while the upper lobe may be affected more by a pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-types-and-pathogenesis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The loss of contact between the visceral and parietal pleurae may be local in this setting, which may cause local rather than generalized atelectasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Compressive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compressive atelectasis occurs when a space occupying lesion of the thorax (eg, loculated pleural effusion, elevated hemidiaphragm, or solid mass of the chest wall, pleura, or parenchyma) presses on the lung and causes the lung volume to diminish to less than the usual resting volume (ie, the functional residual capacity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-types-and-pathogenesis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Compressive atelectasis has a lot in common with relaxation atelectasis (ie, both eliminate contact between the pleurae), except compressive atelectasis is more likely to be focal or localized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-types-and-pathogenesis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Adhesive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adhesive atelectasis is a consequence of alveolar instability due, in part, to surfactant deficiency or dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-types-and-pathogenesis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the normal lung, surfactant reduces the surface tension of alveoli and decreases the tendency of alveoli to collapse. Decreased production or inactivation of surfactant leads to alveolar instability and collapse. Adhesive atelectasis is a major problem in respiratory distress syndrome of premature infants, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in adults, acute radiation pneumonia, and posttraumatic lung contusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-types-and-pathogenesis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Cicatrization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cicatrization (ie, cicatricial atelectasis) results from diminution of lung volume due to severe parenchymal scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-types-and-pathogenesis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Common underlying etiologies include granulomatous disease (eg, sarcoidosis), necrotizing pneumonia, and radiation pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-types-and-pathogenesis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Replacement atelectasis occurs when the alveoli of an entire lobe are filled by tumor (eg, mucinous adenocarcinoma, previously known as bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma), with ensuing loss of volume.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14133513\"><span class=\"h3\">Acceleration atelectasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This type of atelectasis has been described in pilots subjected to very high, vertical accelerative forces between 5G and 9G: at 5G, up to 50 percent of pulmonary airways are distorted and closed due to gravitational forces. The atelectasis is exacerbated by breathing a high fractional concentration of oxygen. Decreases in vital capacity are a reflection of this type of atelectasis in pilots. Acceleration atelectasis can cause symptoms like chest pain, coughing, and dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atelectasis-types-and-pathogenesis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Rounded</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rounded atelectasis (also called folded lung, Blesovsky&rsquo;s syndrome, or atelectatic pseudotumor) is a distinct form of atelectasis associated with pleural disease, particularly following asbestos exposure. It is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiologic-patterns-of-lobar-atelectasis#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiologic patterns of lobar atelectasis&quot;, section on 'Rounded atelectasis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H759875062\"><span class=\"h3\">Plate-like</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plate-like atelectasis, also known as subsegmental, discoid, or linear atelectasis, is a very common type of fleeting atelectasis.
