In addition, conditions affecting the structures in and around the thoracic cage that may cause chest pain also include diseases of the esophagus, upper abdomen, and head and neck. Early recognition of the musculoskeletal syndromes causing chest pain is an important element in the efficient and specific management of pain in patients with these conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the major causes of musculoskeletal chest pain.

However, another 50 to 60 percent have chest wall tenderness that does not reproduce their pain, and the pain was viewed as clinically unimportant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

The upper costal cartilages at the costochondral or costosternal junctions are most frequently involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults/abstract/18,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,22</a>]. The areas of tenderness are not accompanied by heat, erythema, or localized swelling.</p><p>A variety of diagnostic terms have been used in this group of patients, including costochondritis, costosternal syndrome, and anterior chest wall syndrome. The diagnosis is based solely upon the ability to reproduce pain by palpation of tender areas. In some studies, certain maneuvers, such as the &quot;crowing rooster&quot; and horizontal arm flexion maneuvers, have also been found to be useful. A study involving 1212 patients, done in an outpatient primary care setting, showed that the presence of at least two of four specific features (localized muscle tension, stinging pain, pain reproducible by palpation, and absence of cough) was associated with a diagnosis of chest wall syndrome, with 63 percent sensitivity and 79 percent specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-evaluation-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical evaluation of musculoskeletal chest pain&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>Although the costosternal syndrome is a frequent diagnosis in patients with noncardiac chest pain, the causes, natural history, and treatment of this condition are poorly documented. Most prospective studies suggest that about half of these patients will continue to have chest pain for 6 to 12 months, with moderate limitation of activities in most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Lower rib pain syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of names have been given to pain syndromes involving the lower ribs, including rib-tip syndrome, slipping rib, twelfth rib, and clicking rib; this condition is characterized by pain in the lower chest or upper abdomen, a tender spot on the costal margin, and reproduction of the pain by pressing on the spot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In some reports, hypermobility of the anterior end of a costal cartilage has been implicated, possibly related to indirect trauma due to lifting or twisting.</p><p>In addition to direct palpation, another useful diagnostic test is the &quot;hooking maneuver,&quot; in which the examiner's curled fingers are hooked under the ribs at the costal margin and the ribs are gently pulled forward, reproducing the patient&rsquo;s symptoms.</p><p>Painful lower rib syndromes have been found in 3 to 5 percent of patients referred to some gastroenterology practices. A majority of patients with this condition are women, with a mean age in the mid-40s. The pain persists in 70 percent of patients followed for an average of four years from diagnosis. One-third of patients undergo further evaluations for other causes of pain, even after a definitive diagnosis is made.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Less commonly described syndromes</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Sternalis syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sternalis syndrome is a rarely described condition in which localized tenderness is found directly over the body of the sternum or overlying sternalis muscle, and palpation often causes radiation of pain bilaterally. This syndrome is generally self-limited and less likely to cause persistent pain than the more diffuse costosternal syndrome. It should be differentiated from arthritis of the manubriosternal joint, which can sometimes be involved in various types of systemic arthritis. Radiographic changes may be apparent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F71428\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71428 \">image 1</a>) or increased uptake may be demonstrated by bone scanning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F54771\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54771 \">image 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Tietze's syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tietze's syndrome has been defined as a benign, painful, nonsuppurative localized swelling of the costosternal, sternoclavicular, or costochondral joints, most often involving the area of the second and third ribs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Only one area is usually involved, and young adults are more commonly affected. The relationship between Tietze's syndrome and the anterior chest wall involvement of spondyloarthritides (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Ankylosing spondylitis'</a> below) and sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis (see <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis (SAPHO syndrome)'</a> below) is uncertain, but some experts have questioned the existence of Tietze's syndrome as a discrete entity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Tietze's syndrome is rare, and should be differentiated from more diffuse forms of myofascial chest pain (costochondritis) in which no areas of localized swelling are detected on examination (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Costosternal syndromes (costochondritis)'</a> above). The cause of Tietze's syndrome is unknown, but antecedent upper respiratory infections and excessive coughing have been described in some patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Xiphoidalgia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Xiphoidalgia (xiphoidynia) is another relatively rare syndrome that is characterized by localized discomfort and tenderness over the xiphoid process of the sternum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Symptoms are often aggravated by eating a heavy meal or bending or twisting movements; they may also be associated with resumption of heavy work or a recent cough, suggesting a traumatic cause in some patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Spontaneous sternoclavicular subluxation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous, atraumatic subluxation of the sternoclavicular joint, not associated with any systemic process, has been described in small numbers of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This syndrome occurs almost exclusively in women in the 40- to 60-year age group, most often in the dominant hand associated with moderate to heavy repetitive tasks. The subluxation is typically in a cranial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anterior direction. Sclerosis of the medial clavicle is often seen radiographically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Posterior chest wall pain syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thoracic spinal pain syndromes are relatively common in workplace settings, with an annual prevalence ranging from 3 to 55 percent, and pain in this area may be associated with chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. There are several causes of posterior chest wall pain. Thoracic disc herniations are rare and difficult to diagnose but should be considered in patients with unilateral dermatomal pain. This condition is most common in patients in their 40s, two-thirds of whom have &quot;band-like&quot; chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Pain in the upper back, associated with overhead or throwing activities of the upper extremities, may be suggestive of snapping scapula syndrome.</p><p>Costovertebral joint dysfunction is another uncommon condition causing posterior chest wall pain. Patients usually present with pain that is made worse with coughing or deep breathing, and often undergo evaluation for an intrapulmonary process, most often pulmonary embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. On physical examination, pain is often reproduced by palpation in the area of the costovertebral junctions or directly over the affected rib, and local hyperalgesia may be caused by skin pinching. In some cases, degenerative changes are seen in the affected joints.</p><p>The costovertebral joints may be diffusely involved in ankylosing spondylitis, but the chest pain associated with this condition is usually more diffuse and associated with other features of the disease, including limited chest expansion on physical examination.

The most common areas of reported pain in patients with this condition are the low back, neck, shoulders, and hips. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chest pain occurs in fibromyalgia with frequency estimates over a broad range, from 8 to 71 percent. However, 85 percent of patients with fibromyalgia have tenderness over the second anterior costochondral junctions (over 60 percent characterized as moderate or greater), making this one of the most common sites of tenderness in fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In the emergency department setting, only 3 percent of all patients, and 8 percent of those with chest wall tenderness, appear to have fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Similar frequencies have been reported in patients evaluated after negative coronary angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Rheumatoid arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diffuse chest wall pain, as in costochondritis or costosternal syndrome, is not part of rheumatoid arthritis, but symptomatic involvement of the sternoclavicular joint may occur in up to 19 percent of patients with established, generalized rheumatoid arthritis, and radiographic or ultrasound changes may be apparent in 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Establishing the diagnosis is usually not difficult, except in the rare case in which involvement of the sternoclavicular joint is the initial manifestation of the disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Ankylosing spondylitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain in the thoracic spine and around the chest wall, resulting from inflammatory disease of the costovertebral, costotransverse, and thoracic apophyseal joints, is common in ankylosing spondylitis and related conditions. Patients with this spondyloarthritis typically have symptoms in the lower back or buttocks and some element of morning stiffness; in addition, many patients present with pain in the upper spine and anterior rib cage, particularly in the sternum, costosternal areas, and sternoclavicular joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Involvement of these joints often results in limitation of chest expansion. This finding was frequent and typical enough to be included in criteria for this disease, and is often used in clinical practice for monitoring activity and progress of disease.

Radiographic evidence of anterior chest involvement is more common, with 18 percent having sternoclavicular and 51 percent manubriosternal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Psoriatic arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 10 to 25 percent of patients with typical psoriasis develop arthritis, which may be axial or peripheral in distribution. Some patients with psoriatic arthritis have spinal involvement, peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, and dactylitis similar to that seen in ankylosing spondylitis and other forms of spondyloarthritis. However, anterior chest wall involvement is uncommonly reported, and some confusion exists regarding the relationship of this finding to sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis. As in other disorders, anterior chest wall symptoms (1 percent) are less common than radiologic evidence of disease in the manubriosternal and sternoclavicular joint (10 to 25 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Affected patients may present with pain, tenderness, and swelling of the sternum and its articulations, and some patients have restricted mobility. Enlargement and sclerosis of one or both medial clavicles may be seen radiographically, sometimes progressing to involvement of the lateral aspects. Osteolytic lesions may be visible within sclerotic areas. Similar involvement may be seen in the sternum, particularly the manubrium, and the anterior segments of the ribs. In some patients, the condition progresses to total or partial fusion and ossification involving the ribs, sternum, medial clavicles, and adjacent ligaments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-causes-of-musculoskeletal-chest-pain-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].
