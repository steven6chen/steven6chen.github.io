To meet this goal, pediatric clinicians must know the risk factors for obesity and malnutrition and must understand the normal and abnormal patterns of growth and the changes in body composition that occur during childhood and adolescence. In addition, they must be able to accurately perform and interpret the results of the nutritional evaluation.</p><p>Nutritional assessment is the quantitative evaluation of nutritional status. A comprehensive nutritional assessment has four components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary, medical, and medication history</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth, anthropometric, and body composition measurements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory and radiologic tests</p><p/><p>The laboratory and radiologic evaluation of nutritional disorders are reviewed here.

They can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify nutritional deficiencies before clinical findings are evident (eg, iron deficiency)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confirm the presence of nutrient deficiencies that commonly are associated with specific disease entities (eg, fat-soluble vitamins in children with cystic fibrosis)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitor recovery from malnutrition that occurs as a complication of illness</p><p/><p>The laboratory evaluation of the child with or at risk for malnutrition is directed by the history and physical examination. The most valuable studies in the assessment of nutritional status in children are the hemoglobin concentration and red cell indices (mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin) and serum albumin or prealbumin (transthyretin) concentration. In addition, assessing the presence or absence of vitamin deficiency in patients at risk for malnutrition often is important. Potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium concentration, serum prealbumin and albumin concentration should be monitored during refeeding of malnourished children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemoglobin and red blood cell indices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hemoglobin concentration and red blood cell indices can be used to identify children with nutritional deficiencies of iron, folate, or vitamin B12 or with anemia of chronic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microcytosis-microcytic-anemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microcytosis/Microcytic anemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Iron deficiency anemia, associated with hypochromic, microcytic red cell morphology, is the most common nutritional deficiency in children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64267\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64267 \">picture 1</a>). Plasma ferritin is the most sensitive measure of the adequacy of body iron status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66419\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66419 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76236\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76236 \">table 1</a>). However, ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and may be elevated during infectious or inflammatory illnesses. Additional tests that are useful in the evaluation of microcytic anemia include serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, and transferrin.

The anemia of chronic disease typically is normochromic, normocytic, and hypoproliferative. The laboratory hallmarks include a low serum iron, low iron binding capacity, and a normal to increased serum ferritin concentration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65701\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65701 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Transthyretin and albumin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transthyretin (prealbumin) and albumin are surrogate markers of the adequacy of the diet over the short- and long-term, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-and-radiologic-evaluation-of-nutritional-status-in-children/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. In critical illness, these markers are negatively influenced by the acute phase response (due to increases in vascular permeability and reprioritization of hepatic protein synthesis), so they do not accurately reflect nutrition status in children with inflammatory processes and disease. Transthyretin measurements are not useful in the routine evaluation of nutritional status, but they may be helpful in the evaluation of selected patients whose nutritional status is unclear after a global assessment, to determine the adequacy of their recent dietary intake in the context of food availability, provision, and consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-and-radiologic-evaluation-of-nutritional-status-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Transthyretin is a tetrameric unglycosylated plasma protein that is synthesized in the liver. Hepatic synthesis is exquisitely sensitive to the adequacy and levels of protein and energy intake. It is turned over rapidly with a half-life of approximately two days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-and-radiologic-evaluation-of-nutritional-status-in-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. A normal range for serum prealbumin in most laboratories is approximately 20 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> with borderline levels between 16 and 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> and low levels &lt;16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. The threshold defining low levels is 13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in children, and 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-and-radiologic-evaluation-of-nutritional-status-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Serum transthyretin concentrations fall rapidly during periods of poor dietary intake and rise to low-normal values within 10 days of initiation of nutritional therapy and adequate refeeding. Thus, prealbumin is a good predictor of the protein and energy adequacy of the diet in the days prior to testing, and can serve as a marker of an acute reduction in food consumption. It is a more sensitive marker of mild malnutrition than are anthropometric measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-and-radiologic-evaluation-of-nutritional-status-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, it is a negative acute-phase reactant, and concentrations fall in the presence of infection due to increases in vascular permeability and reprioritization of hepatic protein synthesis. Therefore, prealbumin levels do not accurately reflect nutrition status in children with inflammatory processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-and-radiologic-evaluation-of-nutritional-status-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Albumin also is synthesized in the liver but has a half-life of 14 to 20 days and is reflective of dietary intake during the preceding three weeks. Serum albumin concentration gradually returns to normal after initiation of nutritional therapy, but this may take up to three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-and-radiologic-evaluation-of-nutritional-status-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Serum albumin is not a good nutritional marker in the setting of disorders causing large protein losses from the circulation, such as ascites, protein losing enteropathy, renal losses, liver disease, or extensive burns and inflammation. Serum albumin, which reflects intravascular oncotic pressure, may predict enteral feeding tolerance. Higher protein and energy intake from enteral nutrition can be provided when serum albumin levels are greater than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-and-radiologic-evaluation-of-nutritional-status-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Serum albumin and transthyretin concentrations are inversely correlated with morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-and-radiologic-evaluation-of-nutritional-status-in-children/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-evaluation-of-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory evaluation of the immune system&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity testing is done with a series of common antigens (eg, candida, tetanus toxoid, tuberculin [purified protein derivative; PPD], and trichophyton), and a glycerine control, and is read 48 to 72 hours after placement. Compromise of cell-mediated immunity is suggested by induration that is less than 5 mm or less than the induration surrounding the control plus 5 mm. Delayed-type hypersensitivity testing is least useful during an acute illness because cell-mediated immunity may be depressed in this setting, even in the absence of malnutrition.

Fat-soluble vitamin concentration should be monitored in children with malabsorptive disorders, liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and failure to thrive. Fat-soluble vitamin concentrations generally should be monitored at six-month to yearly intervals in these children, depending on the history and severity of malabsorptive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/laboratory-and-radiologic-evaluation-of-nutritional-status-in-children/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].
