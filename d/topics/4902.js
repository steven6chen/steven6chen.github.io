The term AKI has largely replaced acute renal failure (ARF), reflecting the recognition that smaller decrements in kidney function that do not result in overt organ failure are of substantial clinical relevance and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.</p><p>Several consensus definitions of AKI have been developed in order to provide a uniform definition of AKI. These definitions are based exclusively on the serum creatinine and urine output and are used primarily to identify patients with AKI in epidemiologic and outcome studies. They are of limited utility in the clinical assessment and management of patients with AKI.</p><p>The potential etiologies, diagnosis, and management of AKI are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-prerenal-disease-and-acute-tubular-necrosis-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of prerenal disease and acute tubular necrosis in acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to adult patients with subacute kidney injury in an outpatient setting&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H690890668\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definition for AKI used in clinical and epidemiologic studies is based on specific criteria that have been sequentially developed. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition and staging system is the most recent and preferred definition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other criteria include the RIFLE criteria (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage kidney disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and a subsequent modification proposed by the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. These criteria are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F83168\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83168 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The KDIGO guidelines define AKI as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase in serum creatinine by &ge;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (&ge;26.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> within 48 hours, or</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase in serum creatinine to &ge;1.5 times baseline, which is known or presumed to have occurred within the prior seven days, or</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine volume &lt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> for six hours</p><p/><p>The KDIGO criteria allow for correction of volume status and obstructive causes of AKI prior to classification. Before diagnosing and classifying AKI, one should assess and optimize volume status and exclude obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-kidney-injury-among-hospitalized-adult-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute kidney injury among hospitalized adult patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The timeframe for an absolute increase in serum creatinine of &ge;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> is retained from the AKIN definition (48 hours), while the timeframe for a &ge;50 percent increase in serum creatinine reverted to the seven days originally included in the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) RIFLE criteria.</p><p>The RIFLE and AKIN definitions are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F83168\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83168 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H486597861\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING CRITERIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria, AKI is staged as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 1 &ndash; Increase in serum creatinine to 1.5 to 1.9 times baseline, <strong>or</strong> increase in serum creatinine by &ge;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (&ge;26.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> <strong>or</strong> reduction in urine output to &lt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> for 6 to 12 hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 2 &ndash; Increase in serum creatinine to 2.0 to 2.9 times baseline, <strong>or</strong> reduction in urine output to &lt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> for &ge;12 hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage 3 &ndash; Increase in serum creatinine to 3.0 times baseline, <strong>or</strong> increase in serum creatinine to &ge;4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (&ge;353.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L),</span> <strong>or</strong> reduction in urine output to &lt;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> for &ge;24 hours, <strong>or</strong> anuria for &ge;12 hours, <strong>or</strong> the initiation of renal replacement therapy, <strong>or</strong>, in patients &lt;18 years, decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to &lt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p/><p>The KDIGO criteria differ from the RIFLE classification in that the KDIGO criteria only utilize changes in serum creatinine and urine output, not changes in GFR for staging, with the exception of children under the age of 18 years, for whom an acute decrease in eGFR to &lt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> is included in the criteria for stage 3 AKI.</p><p>As with the RIFLE and Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) staging systems, KDIGO suggested that patients be classified according to criteria that result in the highest (ie, most severe) stage of injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H430237715\"><span class=\"h1\">LIMITATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of limitations to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria for AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. These limitations also apply to the older criteria (such as RIFLE and Acute Kidney Injury Network [AKIN]) that also rely solely on changes in creatinine or urine output.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Many etiologies cause AKI </strong>&ndash; A major flaw is that the criteria do not distinguish between the multiple etiologies that cause AKI. It is incorrect to treat AKI as a single disease, particularly grouping together hemodynamic causes (ie, &quot;prerenal AKI&quot;) and acute tubular necrosis. To address this, the KDIGO guidelines specified that patients with AKI be evaluated promptly to determine cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Such evaluation is critical for patient care since reversible causes of AKI (such as obstruction) require specific interventions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, different causes of AKI are associated with different long-term outcomes and prognoses, which is not always addressed in studies that utilize AKI criteria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Finally, from a research perspective, the development of therapeutic interventions requires the addition of etiologic or anatomic diagnoses to the criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Use of urine output to define AKI </strong>&ndash; Another important issue is the use of urine output as a sole criterion for AKI. The KDIGO criteria define stages by change in either serum creatinine or urine output. (See <a href=\"#H690890668\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, using urine output to define or stage AKI is not based on robust evidence. In one assessment of the RIFLE classification, which compared the serum creatinine and urine output criteria, the serum creatinine criteria were strong predictors of intensive care unit (ICU) mortality, whereas the urine output criteria did not independently predict mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Brief durations of oliguria may just reflect insufficient volume resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other studies, however, have suggested that urine output is predictive of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], and one study even suggested that urine output may be a more sensitive marker for AKI than serum creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One study suggests that risks of death or renal replacement therapy were highest when both the serum creatinine and urine output criteria were met [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, although the criteria include both creatinine and urine output, in practice, the urine output is often omitted from studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Until this issue is resolved, it is reasonable to use the criteria that result in the least favorable strata assignment, as suggested in the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and affirmed by KDIGO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Determination of baseline creatinine </strong>&ndash; The determination of a baseline creatinine for individual patients is a third limitation. It is impossible to calculate the change in serum creatinine in patients who present with AKI but who do not have a baseline measurement of serum creatinine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The authors of the RIFLE criteria had initially suggested back-calculating an estimated baseline serum creatinine concentration using the four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, assuming a baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, this approach has been demonstrated to result in significant misclassification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and should not be utilized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) group recommended that the first documented serum creatinine be used as the baseline, rather than using historical values (ie, prior to the acute illness) or a calculated value based on a presumed baseline GFR of 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, the initial hospital creatinine value may already be elevated above the patient's usual baseline if the onset of AKI occurred prior to hospital admission. Creatinine production may also be reduced in the setting of acute illness, leading to an artifactual fall in admission serum creatinine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Changes in volume of distribution of creatinine as the result of volume overload may also depress baseline creatinine values and blunt the rise in creatinine concentration during AKI. Some experts have suggested that an average of creatinine values measured 7 to 365 days prior to hospitalization best approximates the true baseline creatinine value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Even when a baseline creatinine is available, relying on small changes in serum creatinine for the diagnosis of AKI may be associated with a high rate of misdiagnosis, especially in patients with a baseline serum creatinine &ge;1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p>A more global concern raised by the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) work group is that the use of a definition based upon a biomarker, such as serum creatinine, or a variable, such as urine output, may result in a marked increase in the number of nephrology consultations, which would provide uncertain benefit to the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As noted by an accompanying editorial to the KDOQI commentary, discretion is required to determine the clinical significance of a diagnosis of AKI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2445106908\"><span class=\"h1\">UTILITY IN EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria have greatest utility in epidemiologic studies and in defining consistent inclusion criteria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> endpoints for clinical studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The severity of AKI stage is correlated with mortality risk and intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-staging-criteria-of-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/10,19-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,19-31</a>].</p><p>It seems likely that these criteria will eventually be replaced, at least in part, by sensitive and specific biomarkers of renal tubular injury. The use of such biomarkers, analogous to troponin as a marker of myocardial injury, may allow development of a new classification of AKI that is not solely dependent upon serum creatinine or other functional markers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
