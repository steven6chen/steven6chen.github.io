This is of particular importance in the critical care setting, where patients are often obtunded and mechanically ventilated; TEE may aid in differentiating among causes of hypotension, etiologies of dyspnea, and causes of chest pain. To reliably and safely apply TEE to critical care, skill, experience, and multidisciplinary approach are essential. A working relationship among intensivists, anesthesiologists, and cardiologists is an integral part of every successful critical care TEE program.</p><p>This topic will review the hemodynamic information which can be obtained during TEE. The general indications for TEE, along with its use in specific clinical situations, are discussed separately.

The product of stroke volume and heart rate is cardiac output.</p><p>The VTI is the actual area under the Doppler signal obtained or the velocity-time curve; because the Doppler signal is velocity <span class=\"nowrap\">(distance/time),</span> the area under the velocity-time curve is <span class=\"nowrap\">distance/time</span> x time or distance. Thus the velocity time integral is referred to as the stroke distance which is the distance traveled by the sampled volume within each heart beat. Stroke distance is normally 13 to 15 cm for the pulmonary artery and 18 to 20 cm for the aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodynamics-derived-from-transesophageal-echocardiography/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Use of this parameter may eliminate the error introduced by estimating the cross-sectional area of the vessel as the VTI holds constant over a broad range of body surface areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodynamics-derived-from-transesophageal-echocardiography/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. For measurements of stroke distance and the derived cardiac output, it is important that the Doppler beam interrogation angle is within 20&ordm; of the direction of flow. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-doppler-echocardiography#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of Doppler echocardiography&quot;, section on 'Basic principles'</a>.)</p><p>The use of TEE to determine cardiac output by each of these methods has been investigated. The main pulmonary artery is the most convenient site from which to measure the VTI. In the basal short axis view, pulmonary artery diameter can be measured in most patients and flow signals can be obtained using either pulsed or continuous wave Doppler. Several intraoperative studies suggest that the continuous wave Doppler is more accurate than pulsed wave when compared with thermodilution cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodynamics-derived-from-transesophageal-echocardiography/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This method was established in the operating room by comparing it with thermodilution cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodynamics-derived-from-transesophageal-echocardiography/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although cardiac output by thermodilution is not an ideal reference standard, the pulsed-wave Doppler method was able to follow directional changes in that parameter. </p><p>Aortic blood flow cannot usually be accurately measured from the esophageal views because of poor ultrasound beam alignment for Doppler signals. However, using the &quot;deep transgastric view&quot; aligns the LV outflow tract with the transducer to obtain accurate flow signals and permits accurate determination of the cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodynamics-derived-from-transesophageal-echocardiography/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In one intraoperative TEE study, cardiac output by Doppler was compared with thermodilution cardiac output and was shown to have close agreement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodynamics-derived-from-transesophageal-echocardiography/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, the Doppler method was accurate in detecting more than 10 percent of change in cardiac output. However, another more recent study showed relatively poor agreement between TEE estimates of cardiac output and thermodilution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodynamics-derived-from-transesophageal-echocardiography/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Measurements of cardiac output based on mitral flow correlate well with thermodilution cardiac output when biplane TEE measurements of the mitral annulus in the two- and four-chamber views are used to calculate the cross-sectional area as an ellipse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodynamics-derived-from-transesophageal-echocardiography/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Left ventricular and atrial filling pressures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary venous flow patterns, mitral inflow signal configuration, and continuous-wave Doppler of mitral regurgitation contain information from which filling pressures can be estimated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Doppler mitral inflow velocity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doppler demonstration of the velocity profile of LV transmitral inflow is the most informative TEE-based method of assessing LV filling pressures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65233%7ECARD%2F59321\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef65233 graphicRef59321 \">waveform 1A-B</a>). Important diagnostic parameters derived from the mitral inflow signals include the ratio of peak early filling velocity to late diastolic atrial filling velocity <span class=\"nowrap\">(E/A</span> ratio), the deceleration time of early filling curve (DT), and the isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT). Studies have demonstrated that the relationship between peak velocity and deceleration in early diastole with late diastolic velocities during atrial contraction is altered in diastolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodynamics-derived-from-transesophageal-echocardiography/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p>Although there is considerable variability, two predominant patterns of flow have been recognized that reflect the two major categories of diastolic dysfunction, ie, impaired LV relaxation and decreased LV compliance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72146\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72146 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-evaluation-of-left-ventricular-diastolic-function#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function&quot;, section on 'Doppler mitral inflow velocity'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impairment of LV relaxation is characterized by a reduction in mitral flow velocity in early diastole, manifested by an abnormally low E wave, and increased late diastolic filling, manifested by an increased A wave; the <span class=\"nowrap\">E/A</span> ratio is decreased and is &lt;1 compared with normal where the <span class=\"nowrap\">E/A</span> ratio is &ge;1. Additionally, there is prolongation of the deceleration time and the isovolumic relaxation times. This form of diastolic dysfunction occurs in ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and as a result of normal aging. This pattern is usually associated with normal filling pressures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminished LV compliance is characterized by a &quot;restrictive flow&quot; pattern with an increased <span class=\"nowrap\">E/A</span> ratio and a shortened isovolumic relaxation time and deceleration time. This pattern occurs in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathies, such as amyloid heart disease, and in those with elevated filling pressures associated with a variety of myopathic conditions.</p><p/><p>However, the diastolic filling pattern does not always reflect these two circumscribed categories because it is influenced by a variety of other factors, including loading conditions, heart rate, pericardial restraint, left atrial pressure and compliance, right and LV interaction, coronary turgor, the intrinsic properties of left atrial and LV muscle, the presence or absence of mitral regurgitation, and patient age. For example, changes in loading conditions during cardiac surgery have been shown to influence filling patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodynamics-derived-from-transesophageal-echocardiography/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. With an increase in intravascular volume, a rise in early diastolic filling velocity is seen, most likely due to an increased left atrial to LV pressure gradient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodynamics-derived-from-transesophageal-echocardiography/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Similarly, an increase in left atrial pressure due to ischemia may be associated with an increase in early diastolic filling velocities, ie, pseudonormalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodynamics-derived-from-transesophageal-echocardiography/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Pseudonormalization is an intermediate pattern, which reflects an increase in filling pressures. The E velocity increases, and the deceleration time decreases.</p><p>In contrast, hypovolemia or preload reduction (eg, nitrates) may cause a decrease in early filling velocity mimicking impaired relaxation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary venous flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The interpretation of the mitral inflow pattern is complimented by examination of the pulmonary venous Doppler; TEE has contributed substantially to our understanding of this hemodynamic parameter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-evaluation-of-left-ventricular-diastolic-function#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary venous flow'</a>.)</p><p>TEE from the base of the heart demonstrates the entrance of the four pulmonary veins into the left atrium. The left upper pulmonary vein flow is close to and parallel to the direction of the interrogating beam and highly resolved color flow pulsed-wave Doppler images are readily obtained, helping to guide positioning of the sample volume into the proximal 1 cm of the vein.</p><p>Flow in the pulmonary veins is triphasic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodynamics-derived-from-transesophageal-echocardiography/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. The systolic phase is normally predominant in most adults, accounting for more than 55 percent of total flow integral. The second phase occurs in early diastole and is approximately 40 percent of the total. Both of these phases move in an antegrade, central direction and occur during atrial systolic filling and atrial diastolic emptying. The third phase is the late diastolic reversal that results from atrial contraction. In contrast to the first two phases, the late diastolic phase is usually brief and lower in velocity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68801\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68801 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62749\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62749 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77774\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77774 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F87117\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87117 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Variables frequently measured from pulmonary venous flow velocity tracings with demonstrated utility include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peak systolic and peak early diastolic flow velocities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peak velocities of flow reversal at atrial contraction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Velocity-time integrals of the systolic, early diastolic, and atrial contraction phases</p><p/><p>The systolic velocity-time integral (S) is measured from the onset of forward flow following the peak R wave on the electrocardiogram to the point at which it reaches zero flow velocity. The early diastolic velocity-time integral (D) is measured from the onset of the second wave to its crossover with the zero-line. The systolic fraction is equal to <span class=\"nowrap\">S/(S</span> + D). The velocity-time integral of the late diastolic A wave (retrograde flow during atrial contraction) is measured from its onset to the end of negative flow.</p><p>In conditions that alter LV filling patterns, especially when filling pressures are elevated, systolic filling is reduced relative to diastolic filling. This finding is most reliable in patients with reduced LV ejection fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodynamics-derived-from-transesophageal-echocardiography/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Concurrently, retrograde atrial flow may increase in both velocity and duration, and it exceeds forward atrial flow across the mitral valve in duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodynamics-derived-from-transesophageal-echocardiography/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In severe mitral regurgitation, systolic flow reversal has been described as one of the signs of severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodynamics-derived-from-transesophageal-echocardiography/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Mitral inflow and pulmonary venous flow patterns are complementary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodynamics-derived-from-transesophageal-echocardiography/abstract/16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20</a>]. For example, restrictive mitral inflow is characterized by a short isovolumic relaxation time, a normal or slightly elevated peak velocity, a short deceleration time (&lt;150 msec), and a low A wave velocity. A restrictive pattern on mitral inflow and decreased systolic fraction on pulmonary venous inflow are complementary, permitting confident recognition of elevated filling pressure. A prolonged retrograde pulmonary venous A wave and a shortened A wave on mitral inflow also connote elevated pressure.

Rarely, in preload sensitive hearts, contractility may decrease. The left atrium in hypovolemia may decrease in size. Similarly, the right atrium, venae cavae, and hepatic veins become small, and respiratory collapse might be appreciated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypervolemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In hypervolemia, as seen in congestive heart failure, especially if chronic, the left ventricle assumes a spherical state as it remodels and dilates. This appearance is strikingly different from the ellipsoid shape of the healthy heart. While one cannot determine the filling pressure from inspecting the ventricles and atria, observations of these features can reinforce the inferences drawn from Doppler data.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Intra-atrial septal motion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The behavior of the interatrial septum may provide information as to the relative right and left sided filling pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemodynamics-derived-from-transesophageal-echocardiography/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Observations made on ventilated patients showed that in the euvolemic or hypovolemic state, the interatrial septum, normally curved to the right, will reverse curvature at end expiration at both end-systole and end-diastole. The cause of the rapid reversal in curvature has been documented with flow-directed catheters; it arises from a transient reversal in the pressure differential in such a way that right atrial pressure transiently exceeds left atrial pressure during the expiratory phase of the ventilator cycle. This occurs only when pressures (pulmonary capillary wedge and central venous pressure) are low and nearly equal.</p><p>If either atrium carries higher pressure, the atrial septum will remain bowed toward the lower pressure chamber. In mitral regurgitation, for example, the atrial septum bows from left to right, and this curvature is little affected by the respiratory cycle. In tricuspid regurgitation or pulmonary hypertension associated with increased right sided filling pressures, the curvature goes from right to left. It is worth emphasizing how useful this simple observation can be in integrating multiple variables and emerging with a clear picture of a patient's hemodynamics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15996275\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamic variables that can be estimated during transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) include cardiac output, left ventricular (LV) filling pressure, temporal distribution of LV filling, chamber preload, atrial interaction, and pulmonary arterial pressures.
