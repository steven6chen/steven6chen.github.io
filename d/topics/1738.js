Some children require emergent or urgent evaluation of the airway via endoscopy. This procedure generally is best performed in the operating room, intensive care unit, or equivalent setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Initial airway management is based upon the degree of respiratory distress as determined by clinical assessment. In children with signs of severe airway obstruction or impending respiratory failure (ie, hypoxia, marked retractions, poor air entry, fatigue, listlessness, or depressed level of consciousness) airway control precedes diagnostic evaluation.</p><p>Patients with signs of severe upper airway obstruction should be transported to the operating room, if time allows, where an artificial airway can be established, surgically if necessary. A clinician skilled at airway management should monitor the patient at all times. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency endotracheal intubation in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-difficult-pediatric-airway#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The difficult pediatric airway&quot;, section on 'Surgical airway'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-cricothyrotomy-cricothyroidotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency cricothyrotomy (cricothyroidotomy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Supplemental oxygen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supplemental humidified oxygen should be provided for children with respiratory distress or hypoxia as measured by pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopy (flexible or rigid) is an important diagnostic and therapeutic component in the management of children with bacterial tracheitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Endoscopic findings can confirm the diagnosis, and the procedure may be necessary to remove adherent or copious pseudomembranous exudates, which can cause airway obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Endoscopic debridement of tracheal exudates may produce sufficient improvement to permit further management without intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Children who require intubation based upon the severity of their clinical presentation are those most likely to benefit from endoscopy. It is uncertain whether every child with suspected bacterial tracheitis requires endoscopy. In some case series, endoscopy was performed routinely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]; whereas in others, a subset of children was managed without endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Serial endoscopic debridement is generally unnecessary but may be required in some cases to clear secretions that cause endotracheal tube plugging or recurrent episodes of respiratory distress in children not initially intubated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>].</p><p>When endoscopy is needed, we suggest rigid endoscopy for suctioning of tracheal membranes and obtaining specimens for culture in children with high clinical suspension of bacterial tracheitis and moderate to severe respiratory distress <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impending airway compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. For children with less severe presentations, flexible endoscopy is an alternative.</p><p>Children with only minor tracheal irregularities on plain radiographs, absence of respiratory distress and hypoxia, and no other clinical indications for intubation may be initially managed without endoscopy. Such children should be closely monitored for respiratory distress and hypoxia. Should the disease progress, copious exudates or detaching pseudomembranes could obstruct the airway, necessitating intubation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Artificial airway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of children with bacterial tracheitis require endotracheal intubation for airway obstruction related to purulent secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/3,5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,7,8</a>]. In a systematic review of 300 cases, intubation was performed in approximately 72 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Tracheostomy usually is not necessary during initial management but may be necessary for residual subglottic stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/1,3,5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,5,8</a>].</p><p>Patients who are intubated during treatment for bacterial tracheitis require meticulous respiratory nursing care. Frequent suctioning is necessary to prevent obstruction of the endotracheal tube, which can be fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Post-intubation care is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency endotracheal intubation in children&quot;, section on 'Post-intubation care'</a>.)</p><p>Extubation generally can be accomplished when an air leak develops around the endotracheal tube, and tracheal secretions have become minimal (usually after three to six days of treatment). Serial bronchoscopy to document resolution of local inflammatory signs in the trachea is not necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchodilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no clinical trials of bronchodilator therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">albuterol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a>) in the treatment of bacterial tracheitis.</p><p>Since the clinical presentations of bacterial tracheitis and viral croup can overlap, some authors suggest that a lack of response to nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a> inhalation therapy is helpful in distinguishing bacterial tracheitis from croup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Nebulized racemic or L-epinephrine may be used when croup is considered to be the etiology of the clinical presentation (eg, presence of barking cough, subglottic narrowing on plain films) along with bacterial tracheitis. Nebulized epinephrine may or may not help to reduce airway edema or clear airway secretions in patients with bacterial tracheitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=croup-approach-to-management#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Croup: Approach to management&quot;, section on 'Moderate to severe croup'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Croup: Pharmacologic and supportive interventions&quot;, section on 'Nebulized epinephrine'</a>.)</p><p>Wheezing can be associated with bacterial tracheitis as a result of 1) narrowing of the large airways from purulent secretions or sloughed, necrotic mucous membranes or 2) the effects of viral bronchiolitis when such infection is the precipitating factor for bacterial tracheitis. Wheezing may or may not improve after nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">albuterol</a> therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In patients with wheezing, nebulized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">albuterol</a> may be trialed, but if no clinical response is seen within one hour of treatment, ongoing treatments should not be given. If there is a clinical response to albuterol, repeated doses can be administered with ongoing assessment after each treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-in-infants-and-children-treatment-outcome-and-prevention#H87664864\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchiolitis in infants and children: Treatment, outcome, and prevention&quot;, section on 'Bronchodilators'</a>.)</p><p>There are no reports to date on the use of nebulized hypertonic saline solutions as adjunctive treatment for clearance of airway secretions in bacterial tracheitis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids are not part of the routine management of bacterial tracheitis. Empiric use of glucocorticoids is not addressed in most case series. However, in one multicenter retrospective case series, 30 of 34 patients received glucocorticoids, predominantly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The use of glucocorticoids in the initial management does not seem to influence overall outcome; most patients recover fully when these agents are not used. We suggest not using glucocorticoids routinely in the initial management of children with bacterial tracheitis.</p><p>In children who require intubation, glucocorticoids (chiefly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a>) have been used to facilitate extubation as the child recovers from the illness; however, routine use of glucocorticoids in this setting is not generally warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/3,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12,13</a>]. The use of glucocorticoids to facilitate extubation can be considered on a case by case basis several days into the course of antimicrobial therapy when systemic signs are improved and need for suctioning of airway secretions is minimal. The endotracheal cuff air leak test (ie, measuring the amount of pressure required to produce an audible endotracheal tube air leak) is often used in guiding the decision to treat with glucocorticoids; however, this test has not been validated in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">FLUID MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluid management is determined based upon blood pressure, perfusion, and clinical signs of hypovolemia. Children with associated septic shock may require vigorous fluid resuscitation and pressor support; less aggressive fluid management may be sufficient in milder cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-dehydration-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia (dehydration) in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-shock-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of shock in children&quot;, section on 'Fluid administration'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to airway management, patients with bacterial tracheitis require antimicrobial therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibacterial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest initial antimicrobial therapy for bacterial tracheitis include broad coverage for the most frequently isolated pathogens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58913\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58913 \">table 1</a>), which include <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (including methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em>), group A streptococcus, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, and <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial tracheitis in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Microbiology'</a>.)</p><p>The antibiotic regimen for bacterial tracheitis is determined on a case-by-case basis. The optimal antibacterial therapy for bacterial tracheitis has not been studied in randomized controlled trials. The initial antibiotic regimen is individualized according to the likely pathogens, local antimicrobial susceptibility, and Gram stain. Gram stain results may suggest a particular pathogen before culture results are available; however, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy should be continued until culture results are available. When culture and susceptibility results are available, the regimen can be tailored as indicated. Consultation with an expert in pediatric infectious disease may be warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The minimum effective duration of antibiotic therapy is unknown. The available case series provide little meaningful guidance, but a 10-day course appears to be sufficient. Longer courses may be warranted for children with associated extratracheal sites of infection or persistence of tracheal inflammation beyond 7 to 10 days.</p><p>Completion of the course with oral antibiotics may be an option depending upon the availability of oral agents effective against the documented or presumed pathogen(s) and the appropriateness of such agents for treatment of any extratracheal sites of infection, if present. Conversion to an oral agent or agents may be done when the patient is able to resume and tolerate oral feedings <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> at the time of discharge from the hospital if the course of therapy is to be completed as an outpatient. This should generally occur only after systemic signs of illness (eg, fever, respiratory distress) have resolved or improved substantially.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiviral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiviral therapy may be warranted when influenza is the predisposing viral etiology, and viral symptoms have been present for less than two or possibly three days in immunocompetent hosts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-in-children-prevention-and-treatment-with-antiviral-drugs#H37\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza in children: Prevention and treatment with antiviral drugs&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some children require prolonged intensive care, intubation, and hospitalization. In a systematic review of eight case series (total of 217 cases), 75 percent of patients required intubation, the mean duration of intubation ranged from 48 to 182 hours, and the mean duration of hospitalization ranged from 5 to 12 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Most children with bacterial tracheitis will demonstrate substantial clinical improvement within 48 to 72 hours once effective antimicrobial therapy and other supportive measures have been instituted. Children with associated septic shock or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may have a slower rate of response. Broadening the spectrum of coverage of antimicrobial therapy may be warranted if there is ongoing clinical deterioration (eg, increasing hypoxemia or progression from sepsis towards septic shock) or failure to demonstrate improvement within 48 to 72 hours. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES AND COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with bacterial tracheitis usually recover without sequelae.
