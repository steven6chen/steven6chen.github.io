The incidence of anal cancer in the general population has increased over the last 30 years. A higher incidence has been associated with female gender, infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), lifetime number of sexual partners, genital warts, cigarette smoking, receptive anal intercourse, and infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-staging-and-treatment-of-anal-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. From an etiologic standpoint, anal cancer is more similar to genital malignancies than it is to other gastrointestinal tract cancers. Substantial progress has been made in understanding the pathophysiology and the management of anal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-staging-and-treatment-of-anal-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As a result of carefully conducted epidemiologic and clinical studies, it is now known that anal cancer is closely associated with HPV infection and that cure is possible in the majority of patients with preservation of the anal sphincter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virology-of-human-papillomavirus-infections-and-the-link-to-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virology of human papillomavirus infections and the link to cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will cover clinical features, staging, and treatment of anal cancer, both squamous cell and the less common adenocarcinomas. Primary rectal squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), which are very rare, can be difficult to distinguish from anal cancers, and they should be treated according to the same approach as anal cancer. The classification and epidemiology of anal cancer, the diagnosis and management of anal intraepithelial neoplasia, as well as an overview of the link between HPV infection and cancer are presented separately.

Distally, the squamous mucosa (which is devoid of the epidermal appendages, hair follicles, apocrine glands, and sweat glands) merges with the hair-bearing perianal skin (true epidermis). This mucocutaneous junction has been referred to as the anal &quot;verge&quot; or margin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-epidemiology-of-anal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and epidemiology of anal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Four distinct categories of tumors arise in the anal region:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumors that develop from any of the three types of mucosa and that cannot be visualized in their entirety while gentle traction is placed on the buttocks are termed anal canal cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-staging-and-treatment-of-anal-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tumors arising in the transitional or squamous mucosa are squamous cell cancers (SCCs) and appear to behave similarly, despite their sometimes variable morphologic appearance. By convention, most series that report outcomes of &quot;anal cancer&quot; refer exclusively to these tumors. The term &quot;anal cancer&quot; by common definition refers to SCCs arising within the mucosa of the anus, and the two terms will be used interchangeably throughout this review.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Basaloid (also termed junctional or cloacogenic) carcinoma is a variant of SCC that arises from epithelial transitional zone. However, these terms have largely been abandoned because these tumors are now recognized as nonkeratinizing types of SCC. Tumors arising within the anal canal above the dentate line are termed nonkeratinizing SCCs, while those arising within the anal canal distal to the pectinate (dentate) line are termed keratinizing SCCs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adenocarcinomas arising from glandular elements within the anal canal are rare, but appear to share a similar natural history to rectal adenocarcinomas and are treated similarly.

However, the most recent (eighth) edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) cancer staging manual defines tumors that arise within the skin at or distal to the squamous mucocutaneous junction that can be seen in their entirety with gentle traction placed on the buttocks and are within 5 cm of the anus as perianal cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-staging-and-treatment-of-anal-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Like most clinicians, we treat SCC lesions of the perianal skin as anal canal cancers using radiation therapy (RT) and concurrent chemotherapy. Local treatment, surgery, or local RT (electrons) is used only when the lesion is very separate from the anal verge and is a discrete skin lesion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary rectal SCCs, which are very rare, can be difficult to distinguish from anal cancers, and they should be treated according to the same approach as anal cancer.

Anorectal pain or the sensation of a rectal mass is present in 30 percent, while 20 percent have no tumor-related symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-staging-and-treatment-of-anal-cancer/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Bleeding from a mass at or just above the anal sphincter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62539 \">figure 1</a>) may be falsely attributed to hemorrhoids and may delay the diagnosis.</p><p>Among patients with anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a history of anorectal condyloma is present in about 50 percent of homosexual men and less than 30 percent of women and heterosexual men; these values are much greater than in normal controls (1 to 2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-staging-and-treatment-of-anal-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Tumors of the perianal skin, especially Bowen's disease or Paget disease, may present with pruritus ani or a bleeding erythematous eczematoid plaque.

The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) have jointly established a tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system for anal canal cancers that is based upon tumor <span class=\"nowrap\">size/invasion</span> of adjacent structures and the presence or absence of nodal or distant metastases.</p><p>The newest version (eighth edition, 2017) is outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110681\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110681 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-staging-and-treatment-of-anal-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There are some major changes compared with 2010 in that perianal skin cancers are staged and treated like anal canal cancers (rather than squamous cell skin cancers), the N2 and N3 categories are removed, new categories of N1a, N1b, and N1c are defined, and the stage groups are revised to reflect the new N categories.</p><p>At initial presentation, most patients have a T1 or T2 lesion and fewer than 20 percent are node-positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-staging-and-treatment-of-anal-cancer/abstract/7,9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9-13</a>].

Tumors originating above the dentate line, similar to rectal cancers, drain to the mesorectal and internal iliac nodes. In contrast, tumors arising below the dentate line may also spread to the superficial inguinal and external iliac (deep inguinal) nodes. In contrast to earlier editions, in the eighth edition of the <span class=\"nowrap\">AJCC/UICC</span> staging system, metastases in the inguinal, mesorectal, internal, or external iliac are all considered N1 nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110681\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110681 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-staging-and-treatment-of-anal-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, both the staging and treatment of anal cancer was surgical and consisted of abdominoperineal resection and inguinal lymph node dissection. However, combined chemoradiotherapy has emerged as the preferred method of treatment, with radiation therapy (RT) administered to the sites of primary disease and lymphatic spread, usually with prophylactic irradiation of clinically negative groins. This strategy has significantly reduced the rates of locoregional recurrence and led to markedly improved control of gross nodal disease. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'RT dose and schedule'</a> below.)</p><p>Surgical staging is no longer performed routinely. Clinical staging for anal canal cancers consists of physical examination and biopsy of the primary tumor, palpation of the groin, CT of the chest, CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis, and PET scan.

Biopsies were not routinely performed. The cCR rate increased over time in both chemoradiotherapy groups (52, 71, and 78 percent at 11, 18, and 26 weeks, respectively). Importantly, 72 percent of those not in a cCR at 11 weeks achieved it at 26 weeks. Furthermore, the greatest separation in outcomes between complete responders and those who did not achieve a cCR occurred when the assessment took place at 26 weeks (progression-free survival 80 versus 33 percent, HR for progression 0.16, 95% CI 0.12-0.21; overall survival 87 versus 46 percent, HR for death 0.17, 95% CI 0.12-0.23).

In keeping with the guidelines of the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2373\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCCN</a>, we advocate that the initial posttreatment assessment occur at week 8 to 12 and that patients with persistent disease be watched for an additional four weeks to see if there is further regression. Patients who have a clinical suspicion of persistent disease at 26 weeks should undergo biopsy, and those with histologic confirmation of persisting disease should be offered APR. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Assessing the response to primary chemoradiotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p>The results of surgical salvage are similar to those for patients with locally recurrent disease. This was shown in a series of 111 patients with anal cancer who were treated with chemoradiotherapy or RT alone, followed by APR for persistent (n = 61) or recurrent (n = 50) disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-staging-and-treatment-of-anal-cancer/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>].

In multivariate analysis, only three factors significantly influenced prognosis: the status of the surgical margin, perineural <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lymphatic invasion, and whether or not the nodes in the resected specimen were involved with tumor.</p><p>The relative efficacy of nonsurgical salvage in patients with persistent disease is not known. However, at least some of these patients may be successfully salvaged with further sphincter-sparing therapy.

Twelve (55 percent) were rendered disease free after chemoradiotherapy; among these, four required subsequent APR and are free of disease, four died (three with recurrent disease), and four remain disease free.

However, the most recent (eighth) edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) cancer staging manual defines tumors that arise within the skin at or distal to the squamous mucocutaneous junction that can be seen in their entirety with gentle traction placed on the buttocks and are within 5 cm of the anus as perianal skin cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-staging-and-treatment-of-anal-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Most clinicians treat SCC lesions of the perianal skin in a manner identical to anal canal cancers, using radiation therapy (RT) and concurrent chemotherapy. Local treatment, surgery, or local RT (electrons) is used only when the lesion is distinctly separated from the mucosal tissue at the anal verge and is, therefore, a discrete skin lesion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adenocarcinomas arising from glandular elements within the anal canal are rare, but appear to share a similar natural history to rectal adenocarcinomas and are treated similarly.

Based upon the results from the ACT-II trial, patients with persistent disease can be watched for up to six months following completion of RT and chemotherapy as long as there is no progressive disease during this period of follow-up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We suggest not performing a posttreatment biopsy as long as the physical examination does not suggest progressive disease, an approach that is also recommended by the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2373\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

Despite the limited experience in anal SCC, results are consistent with the experience of anti-PD-1 therapy in SCC of the head and neck, another HPV related malignancy.
