The minute-to-minute control of serum ionized calcium concentration is exclusively mediated by PTH, maintaining the concentration of this divalent cation within a narrow range through stimulation of renal tubular calcium reabsorption and bone resorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>On a more chronic basis, PTH also stimulates the conversion of calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D) to calcitriol in renal tubular cells, thereby stimulating intestinal calcium absorption as well as bone turnover. Calcitriol feeds back to inhibit PTH secretion indirectly through its calcemic action, as well as by exerting a direct inhibitory action on PTH biosynthesis and parathyroid cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>This topic will review PTH secretion and action.

The latter is the major storage, secreted, and biologically active form of the hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The biosynthetic process is estimated to take less than one hour. PTH 1-84 is secreted by exocytosis within seconds after induction of hypocalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Once secreted, PTH is rapidly cleared from plasma through uptake principally by the liver and kidney, where PTH 1-84 is cleaved into active amino- and inactive carboxyl-terminal fragments that are then cleared by the kidney. Intact PTH has a plasma half-life of two to four minutes. In comparison, the carboxyl-terminal fragments have half-lives that are 5 to 10 times greater. Circulating immunoreactive PTH in normal subjects comprises:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intact PTH &ndash; 5 to 30 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carboxyl-terminal fragments &ndash; 70 to 95 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amino-terminal fragments &ndash; A small percentage</p><p/><p>Calcium regulates not only the release but also the synthesis and degradation of PTH, in all its molecular forms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. During hypocalcemia, intracellular degradation of PTH decreases, and a greater proportion of PTH 1-84 is secreted relative to other molecular species of the hormone. In comparison, during hypercalcemia, intracellular degradation of intact PTH increases and reduces the availability of biologically active PTH 1-84 for secretion; consequently, mostly biologically inactive carboxyl-terminal fragments of PTH are secreted during hypercalcemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74939\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74939 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/1,3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,7</a>]. Under normocalcemic conditions, PTH 1-84 constitutes 20 percent of total circulating PTH molecules. This proportion increases to 33 percent under hypocalcemic conditions and decreases to 4 percent in the presence of hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The currently available PTH assays are discussed in detail elsewhere.

The midpoint or set-point of the calcium-PTH curve is a key determinant of the level at which serum ionized calcium concentration is &quot;set&quot; in vivo, and the steepness of the curve ensures that this concentration varies little. In normal individuals, a decrease in serum ionized calcium concentration of as little as 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.025 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> produces a large increase in serum PTH concentration within minutes; conversely, an equally small increase in serum ionized calcium rapidly lowers the serum PTH concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The change in calcium concentration is sensed by an exquisitely sensitive calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) on the surface of parathyroid cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The receptor has a long amino terminus, seven transmembrane segments, and a shorter intracellular carboxyl terminus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F58478\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58478 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When activated by a small increase in serum ionized calcium, the calcium-CaSR complex acts via one or more guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins through second messengers, such as increases in the intracellular calcium concentration and inositol phosphates or inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation, to inhibit PTH secretion and decrease renal tubular reabsorption of calcium by the CaSR's actions on parathyroid and kidney, respectively. Conversely, the effect of deactivation of the receptor by a small decrease in serum ionized calcium concentration is to stimulate PTH secretion and enhance renal tubular reabsorption of calcium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The PTH response to hypocalcemia has the following temporal profile; all of these actions are mediated by the CaSR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Seconds to minutes &ndash; Exocytosis of PTH from secretory vesicles into the extracellular fluid</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Minutes to one hour &ndash; Reduction in the intracellular degradation of PTH</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hours to days &ndash; Increase in PTH gene expression as a result of stabilization of PTH mRNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] (also stimulated by low serum calcitriol concentration, which increases transcription of the PTH gene owing to the normal inhibitory action of calcitriol on PTH gene transcription)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Days to weeks &ndash; Proliferation of parathyroid cells (also stimulated by low serum calcitriol concentrations)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Extracellular</strong> <strong>phosphate</strong> &ndash; Phosphate, like calcium, acts as an extracellular ionic messenger. Hyperphosphatemia modulates several of the same parameters of parathyroid function that are regulated by extracellular calcium, calcitriol, and FGF23, namely, stimulating PTH secretion, likely in large part by increasing PTH mRNA stability and promoting parathyroid cell growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. These responses may be mediated, in part, by the induction of hypocalcemia owing to the increase in serum phosphate concentration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, small elevations in serum phosphate concentrations may not be sufficient to lower serum calcium concentration to a level that stimulates PTH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, there is increasing evidence that hyperphosphatemia (independent of the serum concentrations of calcium and calcitriol) directly stimulates PTH synthesis as well as parathyroid cellular proliferation in patients with advanced renal failure, the most common cause of hyperphosphatemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-and-treatment-of-hyperphosphatemia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes and treatment of hyperphosphatemia&quot;, section on 'Acute or chronic kidney disease'</a>). The nature of the putative phosphate-sensing mechanism is unknown.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Calcitriol</strong> &ndash; Parathyroid cells contain vitamin D receptors, and the PTH gene contains a vitamin D-response element.

Calcitriol also inhibits parathyroid cell proliferation. Some of the actions of calcitriol on parathyroid function may result from its capacity to increase the expression of the CaSR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>FGF23</strong> &ndash; In addition to its phosphaturic action, FGF23 exerts direct actions on the parathyroid gland, inhibiting PTH synthesis and secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

The cellular basis for the shift is probably a combination of decreased sensitivity of the parathyroid cells to calcium, possibly due to a decrease in the number of functional CaSRs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> its downstream signaling pathways, an increase in parathyroid cell mass, or both. The molecular basis of primary hyperparathyroidism is known in a minority of cases, although there has been substantial progress in this area in the past decade, particularly in familial forms of hyperparathyroidism. Some examples are genetic defects in menin (in multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 [MEN1] and adenomas), parafibromin (in sporadic and familial parathyroid cancer), cyclin D1 (in adenomas), and the CaSR (in atypical FHH presenting as primary hyperparathyroidism) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

This results in reduced responsiveness to serum calcium levels, with continued secretion of PTH despite normal or high serum calcium levels and ultimately, in some cases, in true parathyroid autonomy (secretion of PTH independent of the prevailing level of serum calcium). In patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism from severe vitamin D deficiency, four-gland parathyroid hyperplasia constitutes the primary pathophysiology, and such hyperplasia may take months to over a year to reverse to normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

In a study of calcium-PTH dynamics in seven young, normocalcemic women who had taken lithium for a mean of 5.2 years, the serum calcium-PTH curve was shifted to the right, as compared with normal subjects, reflecting reduced sensitivity of PTH secretion to inhibition by calcium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66597\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66597 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lithium</a> also affects renal calcium sensing by decreasing renal calcium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], an effect that seems to be independent of PTH levels. This dual effect of lithium at the level of the parathyroid gland and kidney is reminiscent of the pathophysiology of FHH and is highly suggestive of altered calcium sensing at the level of the CaSR. This would also be consistent with the observation that although serum calcium concentrations increase with lithium, they remain within the normal range in most lithium-treated patients.</p><p>However, from 10 to 25 percent of patients receiving chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> therapy develop mild hypercalcemia and slightly high serum PTH concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Conversely, an increasing body of evidence supports a hypocalcemic effect of carboxyl-terminal fragment of PTH, PTH 7-84, which is reversed by PTH 1-34 and PTH 1-84 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The amino terminus of PTHrP is structurally similar to that of PTH; it causes hypercalcemia in patients with PTHrP-secreting tumors by activating the same receptor.

PTH targets osteoblasts to enhance bone remodeling. With PTH stimulation, preosteoblasts mature into bone-forming osteoblasts that lay down collagen and subsequently mineralize matrix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Since the remodeling unit is always coupled (ie, bone formation equals bone resorption), once preosteoblasts are stimulated, they release cytokines that can activate osteoclasts resulting in bone resorption. Thus, osteoclast formation requires an interaction with cells of the osteoblastic lineage, which may depend upon cell-cell contact and regulators of osteoclast formation such as RANK (the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B), osteoprotegerin, and RANK ligand (RANKL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. PTH increases osteoclast activity and number indirectly through effects on RANKL and osteoprotegerin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-skeletal-development-and-regulation-of-bone-formation-and-resorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal skeletal development and regulation of bone formation and resorption&quot;</a>). However, increasing evidence suggests a binding of intact PTH, but not PTH 1-34, to osteoclasts, possibly through the novel but incompletely characterized PTH receptors with specificity for the carboxyl-terminal region of PTH (C-PTHRs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3738100527\" class=\"local\">'PTH receptor activation'</a> above.)</p><p>The net effect of PTH on bone varies according to the severity and chronicity of the PTH excess. Chronic exposure to high serum PTH concentrations (as seen with primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism) results in bone resorption, whereas intermittent administration of recombinant human PTH (both full-length 1-84 or fragment 1-34) has been shown to stimulate bone formation more than resorption.

On the other hand, amino-terminal truncation of the first two amino acids of PTH eliminates most of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling, a pathway that seems important for, but not predictive of, the anabolic effect of PTH on bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/39,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal actions of PTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The kidney plays a major role in mineral ion homeostasis that is largely mediated by the actions of PTH and extracellular calcium ions on their respective receptors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Reabsorption of calcium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Filtered calcium is reabsorbed along much of the nephron. The mechanisms by which it is reabsorbed and their regulation, however, vary as a function of location along the nephron. Most filtered calcium is reabsorbed passively in the proximal tubule down the favorable electrochemical gradients created by sodium and water reabsorption. In contrast, calcium transport is actively regulated in the distal nephron according to the needs of the organism. This takes place in the cortical thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (cTAL), as well as in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and adjacent connecting segment (a small segment between the distal tubule and cortical collecting tubule) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p>PTH acts at both cTAL and DCT in the distal tubule to stimulate calcium reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Thus, if PTH secretion falls appropriately after an increase in serum ionized calcium, the ensuing fall in tubular calcium reabsorption and increase in calcium excretion will contribute to restoring normocalcemia. The high serum calcium itself also contributes to the calciuresis, acting via the CaSR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Reabsorption of phosphate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PTH, along with fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), is a key hormonal determinant of serum phosphate concentration. It inhibits mostly proximal but also distal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus. This effect is primarily mediated by decreased activity, internalization, and degradation of the Npt2A and Npt2C, sodium-phosphate cotransporters in the luminal membrane of the proximal tubules that mediate tubular reabsorption of phosphate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Synthesis of calcitriol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PTH stimulates the synthesis of 1-alpha hydroxylase in the proximal tubules and, thus, conversion of calcidiol to calcitriol (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-d#H1172644\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin D&quot;, section on 'Metabolism'</a>). Approximately 50 percent of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have high serum calcitriol concentrations as a result of this action of PTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>PTH also decreases the activity of a 24-hydroxylase that inactivates calcitriol.

As an example, impaired glucose tolerance and alterations in lipid metabolism reminiscent of the metabolic syndrome have been described in hyperparathyroidism. Similarly, patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have an increased incidence of hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and neuromuscular abnormalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Clinical manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, chronic excess of PTH, along with the associated elevations in the level of FGF23, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular calcification and hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular calcification in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>). These nonclassical effects of PTH may be mediated by differing PTH moieties <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> differing PTH receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

It recognizes both PTH and PTHrP due to the substantial degree of homology in the amino-terminal parts of these two peptides. Agents (available or in development) that activate PTH1R have therapeutic implications:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>PTH</strong> &ndash; Although chronic hyperparathyroidism results in bone resorption, intermittent administration of PTH stimulates bone formation more than bone resorption. Thus, administration of PTH subcutaneously once daily results in substantial increments in bone mineral density and a decrease in the risk of both vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in patients with osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroid-hormone-secretion-and-action/abstract/45,57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,57-59</a>]. The positive effect of intermittent PTH on bone appears to be mediated through the PTH1R, in view of the equivalence of PTH 1-84 and PTH 1-34 in bone anabolism. The exact mechanisms for this anabolism have not been fully elucidated. It involves the induction of multiple target genes promoting enhanced osteoblastic activity, including insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, Runx2, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), 1-alpha hydroxylase, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF); while sclerostin, an inhibitor of the wnt signalling pathway, is suppressed.

In view of the fact that hypoparathyroidism is a hormonal deficiency, replacement of the missing hormone (eg, PTH 1-84), is a potentially attractive intervention.
