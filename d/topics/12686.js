Skeletal-related events (SREs) that are due to bone metastases can include pain, pathologic fracture, hypercalcemia, and spinal cord compression. Across a wide variety of tumors involving bone, the frequency of SREs can be reduced through the use of osteoclast inhibitors, such as bisphosphonates or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a>. </p><p>This topic will provide an overview of therapeutic options for management of adult patients with bone metastases from solid tumors other than multiple myeloma.

Therapeutic options include pain <span class=\"nowrap\">management/analgesia,</span> which may be administered in parallel with osteoclast inhibitors (bone modifying agents), systemic anticancer therapy, radiation therapy (external beam radiation therapy [EBRT], stereotactic body radiation therapy [SBRT] in one to five fractions), bone-targeting radiopharmaceuticals, surgery (which is generally reserved for patients with a complete or impending pathologic fracture), and image-guided thermal ablation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of complete and impending pathologic fractures in patients with metastatic bone disease, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H736596770\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors influencing the choice of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factors influencing the choice of treatment for a patient with bone metastases include symptoms and impact of bone metastases on quality of life, performance status, estimated life expectancy, goals, and preferences for care. Other factors include the clinical disease status (eg, whether an individual has an uncontrolled primary cancer with diffuse, visceral metastases versus a controlled primary with just a few sites of metastasis, termed oligometastatic disease, as well as the length of the disease-free interval if the site represents progression of disease at a follow-up time point) and whether or not there is an impending or existing fracture in the affected bone.</p><p>For patients with vertebral bone metastases, the specific approach also depends on whether or not the spinal cord or cauda equina are at risk due to epidural tumor extension. Decision-making about surgical versus nonsurgical treatment in these patients can be difficult. A decision framework that is based upon neurologic (extent of cord compression, presence or absence of myelopathy), oncologic (radiosensitivity of the malignancy, prior irradiation), mechanical (is there spinal instability), and systemic factors (able to tolerate surgery) has been developed to assist in the decision-making process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-approaches-for-adult-patients-with-bone-metastasis-from-solid-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Optimal treatment of bone metastasis may be complex and require multimodality treatment strategies to achieve optimal outcomes. Treatment recommendations must be individualized to each patient's specific symptoms, clinical presentation, histologic tumor type, performance status, and his or her goals and preferences. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observation may be recommended for an asymptomatic bone metastasis with no significant risk of pathologic fracture or spinal instability, especially if life expectancy is limited.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluating the extent of disease, both local bony and systemic, as well as the natural history of the underlying primary malignancy, is important to establish the goals of treatment. For example, patients with a few focal, isolated bone lesions and a primary histology, such as renal cell carcinoma, may be candidates for aggressive local management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-surgery-in-patients-with-metastatic-renal-cell-carcinoma#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of surgery in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Isolated bone metastases'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The efficacy of systemic anticancer therapy based upon primary tumor type is also a factor. As an example, systemic therapy plays a major role in treatment for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer with symptomatic bone metastases. (See <a href=\"#H2126652885\" class=\"local\">'Systemic anticancer therapy'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moribund or severely medically ill patients, who are not expected to survive the procedure (let alone the hospitalization), should not be offered operative intervention, even if they have a complete or impending pathologic fracture. In such cases, stabilization (eg, bracing a limb or wearing a neck collar for stabilization) with adequate analgesia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other nonsurgical palliative therapy may be a more appropriate option. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma#H1148505683\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of complete and impending pathologic fractures in patients with metastatic bone disease, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Contraindications to surgical management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pain-assessment-and-management-in-the-last-weeks-of-life\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pain assessment and management in the last weeks of life&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3287065400\"><span class=\"h3\">Predicting prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Models to predict prognosis in patients with bone metastases that are based upon the number of skeletal metastases, presence and extent of organ metastases, primary site, hemoglobin level, and performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57945 \">table 1</a>) have been developed, several of which are specific to spine metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-approaches-for-adult-patients-with-bone-metastasis-from-solid-tumors/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].

When pain is not adequately relieved, these nonopioid analgesic drugs may be used in combination with an opioid. Although there are several products available that combine an opioid and acetaminophen, hepatic toxicity from acetaminophen is a major concern, and the therapeutic dose of the combination is limited by the amount of acetaminophen.

Chest wall and rib metastasis, for example, may respond significantly to a local pain block.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome#H610740485\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;, section on 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy'</a> and <a href=\"#H1931232115\" class=\"local\">'Stereotactic body radiation therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radium-223-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Radium-223</a> is a reasonable option for initial therapy of men with castration-resistant prostate cancer, multifocal symptomatic osteoblastic bone metastases, and no known visceral metastatic disease. For other histologic cancer types, bone-targeted radiopharmaceuticals are generally reserved for individuals with persistent or recurrent multifocal bone pain and osteoblastic metastases after EBRT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other forms of therapy. In this setting, samarium-153 is a reasonable option, but we would not use radium-223. (See <a href=\"#H3514016125\" class=\"local\">'Bone-targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Surgical management of bone metastases is typically reserved for lesions with a completed or impending pathologic fracture, if surgical intervention is consistent with the goals of care. Surgery may also be needed for spine metastases that are causing mechanical instability or epidural spinal cord compression (ESCC). (See <a href=\"#H996233748\" class=\"local\">'Indications for surgical consultation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The majority of patients without an impending or completed fracture or evidence of ESCC do not require surgery for bone metastasis. However, for highly selected patients with advanced cancer who present with or develop a bone lesion as the only focus of cancer beyond the primary site, en bloc resection of the metastasis may optimize local tumor control, provide durable pain relief, and possibly prolong patient survival. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-surgery-in-patients-with-metastatic-renal-cell-carcinoma#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of surgery in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Isolated bone metastases'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">For patients with long bone or spinal metastases, postoperative radiation therapy is generally given after surgical stabilization to promote remineralization and bone healing, alleviate pain, improve functional status, and reduce the risk for subsequent fracture or loss of fixation by treating residual metastatic disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are generally reserved for patients with symptomatic osteolytic spinal metastases causing vertebral compression fracture without epidural disease or retropulsion of bone fragments into the spinal cord. However, for asymptomatic patients who are at risk for spinal cord compression due to significant malignant destruction of the vertebrae, elective vertebroplasty may also be considered. (See <a href=\"#H2792775982\" class=\"local\">'Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who have persistent or recurrent pain attributed to one or a few skeletal sites after palliative radiation therapy and who are not surgical candidates, local thermal ablation (radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, and focused ultrasound) are important therapeutic options. (See <a href=\"#H2244752607\" class=\"local\">'Local ablation'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-therapeutic-approaches-for-adult-patients-with-bone-metastasis-from-solid-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Mundy GR.
