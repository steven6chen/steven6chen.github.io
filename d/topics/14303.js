However, there are unique features regarding both medical and behavioral health of gay men of importance to practicing clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In addition, gay men may have particular concerns about access to care, insurance coverage, and the clinical office environment that should be considered as part of ensuring equal access to care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

In particular, gay men are at higher risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), especially among communities of color. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 66 percent of new cases of HIV in the United States were in men who have sex with men (MSM) in 2011, including MSM who use injectable drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In England, while the total number of STI diagnoses decreased overall from 2013 to 2014, diagnoses in MSM increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In addition, gay men across a large age spectrum are more likely to attempt suicide, be homeless, and have high rates of tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use. Older gay men face additional barriers to health because of isolation and lack of supportive services.</p><p>Despite identified disparities, education about the care of gay men is sorely lacking in the context of medical education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY AND IDENTITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The population that has come to be referred to as &quot;gay&quot; in the West is not a descriptive term that would be recognized by all men who have sex with men (MSM). While gay culture is increasingly open and discussed, the world of MSM consists of a diverse population that often may respond differently depending on how communications in clinical settings are framed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Sexual orientation is generally thought of as having three components: identity, behavior, and desire. &quot;Gay&quot; is generally used to describe how people identify themselves, while &quot;men who have sex with men&quot; (MSM) describes a behavior. MSM may identify themselves as gay, bisexual, queer, same-gender loving, or heterosexual. Additionally, some who are just beginning to come out may experience desire to be intimate with other men, but may not yet have been sexually active with men or even identify as being gay.</p><p>Some MSM do not even regard sex with other men as sexual activity, a term they reserve for sexual relations with women. This is particularly true among individuals from non-Western cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Nevertheless, it is also common in the United States.</p><p>Some natal men may identify themselves as belonging to a gender that varies from the sex they were assigned at birth. They may identify as transgender, using a term such as trans woman, or use a term such as &quot;genderqueer,&quot; which blurs the gender male-female binary. Other terms are used around the world, but transgender is often used as an umbrella term to describe individuals whose gender varies from their assigned sex at birth. Care of transgender individuals involves both general primary care as well as behavioral, hormonal, and surgical care relating to eliminating gender dysphoria. It is important that primary care clinicians know whether their patients are transgender so they can manage these issues as well as preventive and other care related to natal anatomy, such as screening for cancer.</p><p>These issues are important for health care because issues related to sexual desire, sexual activity, and sexual identity may lead to distinct psychological concerns and may affect risks for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and certain cancers. Understanding a patient's sexual orientation, including one's identity, behavior, and desires, all have a bearing on the ability to provide quality care.</p><p>It is also important to recognize that gay men are an extremely diverse group with respect to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kinsey's study Sexual Behavior in the Human Male in 1948 was the first report on homosexual experiences among men in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. More current studies suggest that about 3.5 percent of the population identify as gay, while higher percentages engage in same-sex sexual activity (8 percent) and an even greater number are attracted to people of the same sex (11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Regardless of the precise numbers, in the United States census figures confirm that &quot;same sex&quot;-headed households are widespread through the country. Such households were found in over 93 percent of counties in every state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Thus, all clinicians, at least in the United States, should be considering &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;men who have sex with men&quot; (MSM) sexual behavior when seeing patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">OBTAINING A HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is common in United States medical schools to be taught, when taking a sexual history, to ask whether someone is sexually active, and if so, whether he has sex with men, women, or both; how many sexual partners he has had in the past year; and whether he engages in anal, oral, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vaginal sex. Patients should be told that the information related to sexual orientation is asked of everyone and has relevance to health care and prevention decisions.</p><p>Although nonjudgmental questions about sexual behavior are valuable, they may not identify those who have never engaged in same-sex behavior but have the desire to do so. Unrealized sexual desires may be an important trigger for discussing issues such as related anxiety or depression, fear of &quot;coming out,&quot; and concern about how this information in the medical record could affect potential insurance coverage or employment.</p><p>Additional questioning about concerns with sexuality or gender identity may help identify issues related to sexual health and concern about sexual function, as well as possible gender identity issues.</p><p>Such questioning may include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Are you sexually attracted to men, women, or both?&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Do you feel comfortable with your sexuality?&quot;</p><p/><p>It is also important to ask about any history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). (See <a href=\"#H2924084\" class=\"local\">'HIV'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ISSUES TO TARGET</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few population-based studies of health issues in gay men. Based on clinical experience and epidemiology, we identify a number of areas in which clinicians providing primary care to gay men should provide additional emphasis beyond what they might focus on in heterosexual men. A 2011 monograph published by the Institute of Medicine that highlights studies of disparities among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in general and gay men specifically highlighted that important issues to target include: human immunodeficiency virus <span class=\"nowrap\">(HIV)/acquired</span> immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); infectious diseases including sexually transmitted infections (STIs); cancer; immunizations; substance and tobacco abuse; behavioral health, mental disorders, and domestic violence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2924084\"><span class=\"h2\">HIV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, the incidence of HIV has increased in populations of men who have sex with men (MSM), particularly African-American and, to a lesser extent, Hispanic adolescents and young men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The reason for the high incidence among black MSM is not due to increased unsafe sexual practices or drug use but is related to lack of awareness of HIV status, lack of access to care, delayed recognition and treatment of STIs, and increased prevalence of HIV in black MSM social networks making the risk of any single encounter greater [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that 67 percent of new cases of HIV in 2011 were among MSM, including MSM who also use intravenous drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20</a>].

Recommendations for universal screening are discussed separately.

In the United States, ART is recommended for everyone with HIV, regardless of CD4 count, because it may help halt the progression of disease and prevents HIV transmission by lowering viral loads and making transmission to uninfected individuals less likely. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;When to initiate antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77651224\"><span class=\"h3\">Use of barrier methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For individuals who are uninfected, it continues to be important to counsel for use of condoms whenever there is vaginal or anal intercourse. There is a small risk of HIV transmission with oral sex, which is highest when an HIV infected man ejaculates into the mouth of someone who has open mouth sores. While it makes sense to inform patients that routine use of condoms can decrease the risk of HIV transmission, it is also important to recognize that many patients do not use condoms for sex on a regular basis and that, in the United States, there has been an increase in unprotected anal intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].This suggests the need to consider recommending use of PEP or PrEP accompanied by ongoing counseling and monitoring for adherence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2924403\"><span class=\"h3\">Postexposure prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MSM should be educated about getting PEP in the event of an unsafe sexual encounter (eg, condom breakage). Repeated exposures suggest the need for additional counseling about risk reduction and safer sex.

Overall, these studies demonstrated that the effectiveness of TDF-FTC is highly contingent upon medication adherence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Administration of pre-exposure prophylaxis against HIV infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2924598\"><span class=\"h2\">Sexually transmitted infections</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prevention </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Clinicians can play an important role in prevention of STIs by discussing risk reduction and safe sexual practices with patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Individuals need reassurance that close physical contact, kissing, and hugging are safe. While there is only a small risk of HIV transmission associated with oral sex, the same is not true for other STIs like syphilis and chlamydia. STIs are largely transmitted during oral, vaginal, or anal intercourse. Clinicians should spend more time on such discussions when there is a concern that a patient may have multiple sexual partners, has not been practicing safe sex, has been recently diagnosed with an STI, or engages in drug abuse while having sex. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-sexually-transmitted-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of sexually transmitted infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Screening </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>In the United States, the CDC recommends screening asymptomatic sexually active MSM for HIV, syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea at least annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>]. Although there are few data to show that these screening tests improve outcomes, it is reasonable to perform screening on at least an annual basis given the high prevalence rates of these STIs in MSM. It should be noted that, in the United States, routine STI screening may not be covered by all insurance plans. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections#H1690965\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for sexually transmitted infections&quot;, section on 'Men who have sex with men'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The CDC and United States Preventive Services Task Force also recommend screening MSM for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/29,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,32,33</a>]. Serologic testing and diagnosis of HBV infection are discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-screening-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Screening and diagnosis&quot;</a>). If patients are negative for HBV infection or immunity, they should be vaccinated (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Immunizations'</a> below). One-time screening for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is also reasonable given the mounting evidence of sexual transmission in MSM. Screening for HCV infection is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MSM experience increased rates of anal carcinoma.

Certain subtypes of HPV appear to predispose more to this progression. A 2012 systematic review showed that there is a higher prevalence of anal HPV infection in MSM, regardless of HIV status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Screening with anal cytology to look for precancerous lesions related to HPV infection or anal cancer, while practiced by many, is not widely recommended by clinical guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/29,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,36,37</a>], but at least one study has suggested that such screening is cost-effective, at least in HIV-infected men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. We suggest discussing with MSM that anal cytology is used to evaluate the anal transition zone for anal squamous intraepithelial lesions; however, evidence on screening outcomes is lacking.

Clinicians can often be the ones who first detect evidence of this problem through discussion. A multidisciplinary approach to stopping alcohol use is necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychosocial-treatment-of-alcohol-use-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychosocial treatment of alcohol use disorder&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-alcohol-use-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-unhealthy-use-of-alcohol-and-other-drugs-in-primary-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for unhealthy use of alcohol and other drugs in primary care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brief-intervention-for-unhealthy-alcohol-and-other-drug-use-efficacy-adverse-effects-and-administration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brief intervention for unhealthy alcohol and other drug use: Efficacy, adverse effects, and administration&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Drug abuse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, drugs for abuse are not different among the gay populations than among others. There are, however, trends of drug use that do predominate in the gay community. These drugs are frequently used in clubs and at circuit parties (large events held in different communities at different times of the year). According to one 2013 survey, reported use of alcohol, marijuana, and methamphetamine were most common among substance-using MSM; use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amyl-nitrite-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amyl nitrite</a>, ecstasy, and cocaine were less common but still elevated relative to the United States general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Depending on what drugs are being used, these may lead to significant short- and long-term morbidity. The disinhibition associated with these has been one explanation for rising rates of HIV infection and STIs among gay men after years of decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>].</p><p>Screening for drug abuse is discussed in detail separately.

In 1986, the term &quot;ego-dystonic homosexuality&quot; was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III). There have been no major studies of mental health issues in the gay and lesbian population. However, smaller studies have identified higher rates of major depressive disorders and bipolar disorders in gay men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. There also appears to be an increased prevalence of anxiety disorders, particularly in relation to a man's growing consciousness of being gay and struggling to come out [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Although there has been debate about whether gay men are at higher risk for suicide, many studies show increased suicidal ideation and suicide attempts among gay men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Rates are particularly high among gay youth; suicidal ideation and attempts are three to seven times higher among gay youth than among heterosexuals. Gay adolescents and men have also been found to have increased disorders of body image as well as eating disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Despite the lack of clear data from solid research, the environment in which many gay adolescents and adults grow up, the violence faced by many at times in their lives, and the anxiety and fear during the process of coming out can leave emotional scars that often need to be addressed during adolescent or adult life. As a result, discussion of these and related issues is important and referral for counseling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychopharmacologic intervention is often warranted. Many continue to struggle to come out and integrate a gay identity. Nevertheless, many gay men demonstrate great resilience and are able to incorporate a gay identity with no sign of related behavioral impact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Since the legalization of gay marriage in a number of countries, issues of family commitment, marriage, adoption, foster parenting, and surrogacy are emerging as important topics for discussion with patients who will often look to clinicians for information about issues, such as ways that same-sex couples can parent children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Domestic violence, sexual assault, and hate crimes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies suggest rates of domestic violence among intimate gay couples at approximately the same rate as among heterosexual couples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intimate-partner-violence-epidemiology-and-health-consequences\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intimate partner violence: Epidemiology and health consequences&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Two striking differences are that informal discussions with local victims suggest that there is little screening done for this among gay couples, and facilities designed to accommodate victims of domestic violence are rarely able to accommodate men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>A related and significant issue is sexual assault among gay men in general which tends, due to the shame of the victim as well as bias among some law enforcement officers, to go underreported. Rape crisis programs are often unprepared to deal with male victims of sexual assault and rape and some legal definitions of rape exclude male victims. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of adult and adolescent sexual assault victims&quot;</a>.)</p><p>On a broader scale, studies have shown that gay men are perhaps the most frequent victims of violence. Finding a sympathetic place to go can be difficult. One study showed that only a small percentage of violent incidents were reported due to fear that open discussion would lead to further injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. There is some justification for this belief in that an analysis of surveys of antigay violence showed a significant number of victims had been victimized by police [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Primary care clinicians in the United States should be aware of the relatively high prevalence of violence and hate crimes against gay men in the community. Although, as with heterosexual domestic violence and violence in general, there is little evidence about the benefits of screening or intervention, we believe that it is important to discuss with patients whether they have ever been physically or emotionally assaulted so that appropriate interventions can be designed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">MAKING CARE ACCESSIBLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gay men, like all patients, must be made to feel welcome in order to increase the likelihood that they will be honest with their providers and follow advice for preventive care. Perhaps the most important feature of care is application of an open and nonjudgmental approach to finding out about each patient, supplemented by appropriate questions.</p><p>The same applies to the office environment. Educational materials in waiting areas can give subtle signs that a practice may not be sensitive to same-sex issues if they do not include information on avoidance of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or the availability of resources for Domestic Violence.</p><p>Some centers are now routinely asking patients to volunteer information on sexual orientation and gender identity at the time of registration. This information is confidential and can then be used by clinicians to guide them in taking a patient history. Similarly, registration forms which ask for information in language that suggests only traditional family structures can be off-putting not only to gay people, but to many who live in committed relationships but remain unmarried. It is important that rather than just asking if a patient is married, single, or divorced, there be an option to indicate a significant other or domestic partner. Similarly, in countries and states where same-sex marriages are recognized, staff must understand to treat this information in the same way they would treat information about spouses on forms submitted by heterosexual couples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. Facilities for children have to recognize that increasing numbers of children will now register with two same-sex parents. Clinicians must be culturally sensitive to insure that all of our patients do not experience psychological barriers to care.</p><p>In the United States, the Joint Commission and Department of Health and Human Services are looking at ways to improve the care environment for gay men and to collect more data routinely in clinical settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-gay-men-and-men-who-have-sex-with-men/abstract/19,61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,61,62</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-care-in-adults-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive care in adults: Recommendations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-care-in-adults-recommendations#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive care in adults: Recommendations&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many men who have sex with men (MSM) don't identify as gay. In light of this, it is important to ask patients about identity as well as behavior and desire. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Obtaining a history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that clinicians ask the following nonjudgmental questions of adult patients to determine both sexual activities and sexual desires (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Obtaining a history'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Have you been sexually active in the past year?&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Do you have sex with women, men, or both?&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Are you sexually attracted to men, women, or both?&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&quot;Do you feel comfortable with your sexuality?&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest at least annual screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea in MSM (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). More frequent testing may be indicated in MSM engaging in high-risk behaviors such as unprotected sex with men known or likely to be infected with HIV. Additionally, MSM should be counseled about safer sex, risk reduction, and the availability of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for sporadic exposures to HIV and preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for ongoing protection. (See <a href=\"#H2924598\" class=\"local\">'Sexually transmitted infections'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-sexually-transmitted-infections#H1690965\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for sexually transmitted infections&quot;, section on 'Men who have sex with men'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of evidence on outcomes, in MSM who are infected with HIV or who have perianal human papilloma virus (HPV) lesions, we suggest screening for anal cancer and precancerous lesions with anal cytology (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). It is reasonable to discuss the risks and benefits of such screening with other MSM. Men with perianal warts should be carefully evaluated for dysplastic lesions as part of management of those warts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anal-squamous-intraepithelial-lesions-diagnosis-screening-prevention-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anal squamous intraepithelial lesions: Diagnosis, screening, prevention, and treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that all MSM be immunized for hepatitis A and hepatitis B (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Other immunizations may also be necessary. Immunization for HPV in boys and young men is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Immunizations'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other issues that are worth particular attention in the primary care of gay men include drug abuse, tobacco abuse, alcoholism, domestic and community violence, and behavioral health and mental disorders. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Issues to target'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary care providers should consider modifying aspects of their office environment so as to provide a care location that is perceived as welcoming by all patients, including gay men.
