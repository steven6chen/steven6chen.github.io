The initiation of therapy was significantly delayed in both studies (&gt;20 days after disease onset in Norway and 12 days in Canada), as the onset of yersiniosis is often insidious. It is unclear if earlier treatment would prove more beneficial. However, rapid microbiologic clearance of the organism was observed following treatment in both of these studies.</p><p>There was no clinical benefit from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> treatment in a prospective placebo-controlled trial in 136 pediatric patients with <em>Y. pseudotuberculosis</em> infections in Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-yersinia-enterocolitica-and-yersinia-pseudotuberculosis-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although there was no difference in clinical response between treatment and control groups, following five days of treatment, clearance of the organism was significantly greater in the ampicillin group (continued organism excretion 0 versus 90 percent, respectively). There is also <strong>no</strong> evidence that early antimicrobial therapy reduces the frequency or severity of chronic sequelae for either <em>Y. enterocolitica</em> or <em>Y. pseudotuberculosis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-yersinia-enterocolitica-and-yersinia-pseudotuberculosis-infection/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Most cases of <em>Yersinia </em>enterocolitis do not merit treatment and no clinical benefit of treatment has been documented.

Reducing levels of contamination of raw pork products with <em>Yersinia</em> by improved hygiene at slaughter is important. Pasteurizing milk and maintaining high standards of sanitation in dairy plants prevents contamination of dairy products.</p><p>The most common food vehicles implicated in <em>Y. enterocolitica</em> infection transmission are pork and raw pork products, particularly tripe or chitterlings. A common route of transmission is indirect, via the hands of the person handling the raw food to the formula bottle of the infant. Separating the two tasks of preparing raw meat foods and caring for an infant is an important prevention measure.</p><p>Careful washing of hands, cutting boards and utensils with soap immediately after handling raw meats, as well as general measures to prevent cross contamination in the kitchen can help prevent transmission. Persons preparing pork should avoid eating raw or undercooked pork, even as part of adjusting spices while cooking. Consumption of raw ground pork, common in some Northern European countries, is to be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-yersinia-enterocolitica-and-yersinia-pseudotuberculosis-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In Finland, foodborne <em>Y. pseudotuberculosis</em> has most often been associated with carrots and lettuce, possibly contaminated in the field or during winter storage by wild animals carrying the pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-yersinia-enterocolitica-and-yersinia-pseudotuberculosis-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].
