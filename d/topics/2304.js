When these tubes are infected, they get swollen and full of mucus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52758\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52758 \">figure 1</a>). That makes it hard to breathe.</p><p>Bronchiolitis usually affects children younger than 2 years of age. In most children, bronchiolitis goes away on its own. But some children with bronchiolitis need to be seen by a doctor. The most common cause of bronchiolitis is a virus called &quot;respiratory syncytial virus,&quot; or &quot;RSV.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H385677551\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of bronchiolitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchiolitis usually begins like a regular cold. Children who get bronchiolitis usually start off with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A stuffy or runny nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mild cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fever (temperature higher than 100.4&ordm;F or 38&ordm;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A decreased appetite</p><p/><p>As bronchiolitis progresses, other symptoms can start, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing fast or having trouble breathing. In babies, the first sign can be a pause in breathing that lasts more than 15 or 20 seconds.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wheezing, or a whistling sound when breathing (which usually lasts about 7 days)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A severe cough (which can last for 14 days or longer)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble eating and drinking (because of the other symptoms)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H385677558\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I take my child to see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many children with bronchiolitis do not need to see a doctor. But you should watch for some important symptoms.</p><p><strong>Call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong> if your child:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stops breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Starts to turn blue or very pale</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a very hard time breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Starts grunting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Looks like he or she is getting tired of having to work so hard to breathe</p><p/><p>Call your child's doctor or nurse if you have any questions or concerns about your child, or if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The skin and muscles between your child's ribs or below your child's ribcage look like they are caving in (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59786\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59786 \">figure 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child's nostrils flare (get bigger) when he or she takes a breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your baby younger than 3 months has a fever (temperature greater than 100.4&ordm;F or 38&ordm;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your child older than 3 months has a fever (temperature greater than 100.4&ordm;F or 38&ordm;C) for more than 3 days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your baby has fewer wet diapers than normal</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H385677572\"><span class=\"h1\">How is bronchiolitis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main treatments for bronchiolitis are aimed at making sure that your child is getting enough oxygen. To do that, the doctor or nurse might need to suction the mucus from your child's nose, or give your child moist air or oxygen to breathe.</p><p>The doctor will probably not offer antibiotics, because bronchiolitis is caused by viruses, and antibiotics do not work on viruses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H385677579\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to help my child feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes.

(Do not use pillows if your child is younger than 1 year.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep in the same room as your child, so that you know right away if he or she starts having trouble breathing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not allow anyone to smoke near your child</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H385677586\"><span class=\"h1\">How did my child get bronchiolitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchiolitis is caused by viruses that spread easily from person to person.
