The liver typically extends from the fifth intercostal space to the right costal margin in the midclavicular line. The size of the liver increases with age, from an average span of 5 cm at the age of five years, to 15 cm in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The size of the normal liver also varies with sex and body size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The normal liver weighs 1.4 to 1.5 kg in men and 1.2 to 1.4 kg in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Relative to body size, the liver is larger in the fetus <span class=\"nowrap\">(1/18</span> of total body weight) than in the adult <span class=\"nowrap\">(1/36</span> of total body weight) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>By ultrasound, a normal liver is less than 16 cm in the midclavicular line [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a study of 2080 patients who underwent transabdominal ultrasonography, the average liver span in the midclavicular line was 14.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">+/-</span> 1.7 cm, with 74 percent having a liver span of 15 cm or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Fourteen percent had a liver span of 15 to 16 cm, and 12 percent had a liver span of &gt;16 cm. On multivariable analysis, liver span correlated directly with height and body mass index and was greater in men.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18910224\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classically, the liver is divided into right and left lobes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67698\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67698 \">figure 2</a>). In the normal liver, the right lobe is larger than the left lobe and occupies the right hypochondrium. The smaller left lobe is flatter and is situated in the epigastrium and left hypochondrium.</p><p>The liver can be subdivided into eight segments based on vascular supply, each containing branches of the portal vein, hepatic artery, hepatic vein, and bile ducts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81897\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81897 \">figure 3</a>). There are no surface fissures or anatomic landmarks demarcating the individual segments. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18910203\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic variations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anatomic variations of the liver may be confused with hepatomegaly. Riedel's lobe is a downward, tongue-like projection of the right lobe of the liver that on imaging may give the false impression of hepatomegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The exact etiology is unknown. It has been described as an accessory lobe with an incidence that varies from 3 to 31 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Since Riedel's lobe is a benign condition, no treatment is necessary. </p><p>The left lobe of the liver can also be elongated and is described as a &quot;beaver-tailed liver.&quot; In this case, a large left hepatic lobe may be confused with hepatomegaly or the left lobe hypertrophy that can be seen in patients with cirrhosis.</p><p>Another anatomic variation that may be confused with hepatomegaly is projection of a papillary process from the caudate lobe (segment I) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81897\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81897 \">figure 3</a>). The caudate lobe papillary process may extend posteriorly, lying between the inferior vena cava (IVC) and aorta. Occasionally, the papillary process will wrap around the IVC such that its tip lies posterior to the IVC. This position of the papillary process creates the potential for its misdiagnosis as hepatomegaly on imaging studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H468980572\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTIMATING LIVER SIZE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatomegaly may be suspected based on physical examination findings or hepatic imaging. Although percussion and palpation of the liver are commonly used clinical methods for determining liver size, radiologic methods are used frequently to assess the liver size and texture, and to look for signs of chronic liver disease, focal liver masses, or evidence of portal hypertension. Diagnostic imaging techniques are superior to clinical examination in determining the size of the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62208039\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The liver is the largest organ in the body, but accurate clinical assessment of the precise size of the liver is difficult. The size of the liver will vary depending on the examining technique. Percussion in the midclavicular line is the favored physical examination technique to determine the span of the liver. However, physical examination findings are not reliable for detecting hepatomegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. </p><p>The upper border of the liver is assessed using a heavy percussion technique. Light percussion is used to locate the lower edge of the liver. Light percussion is required because heavy percussion may underestimate the lower extent of the liver border [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>]. In a normal liver, the upper border will be in the fifth intercostal space or behind the sixth rib, and the lower extent will be at or slightly below the right costal margin. Percussion alone may underestimate liver size because the lower border of the liver may seem resonant to percussion, particularly if percussion is performed too heavily. If the distance from the upper border of the liver to the percussed or palpated liver edge is less than 13 cm, then true hepatomegaly is unlikely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Palpation of the liver is also used to determine the shape and consistency of the liver. The examining hand is placed below the level of the dull percussion note in the mid-clavicular line, parallel to the rectus muscle. The liver is palpated during deep inspiration as it moves inferiorly to meet the finger tips. The liver edge may be tender in patients with acute hepatitis or heart failure, or it may be hard and irregular in patients with cirrhosis or metastatic disease. Unfortunately, the assessment of liver consistency, nodularity, and tenderness is unreliable, even among expert examiners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Another technique commonly used for assessing liver size is the &quot;scratch test.&quot; The diaphragm of the stethoscope is placed at the lower costal margin while the abdominal wall is scratched lightly. When scratching occurs over the lower part of the liver, the scratching sound should seem louder on auscultation. Unfortunately, correlation between the scratch test and ultrasound assessment of liver size is moderate at best [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>In a large Italian study of 100 normal controls and 100 patients with liver cirrhosis, there was poor correlation between clinical exam and ultrasound assessment of liver span in healthy controls, with a chance-corrected agreement index of 0.13. Correlation was better in patients with cirrhosis (kappa = 0.93). The lower edge of the liver was palpable in 47 percent of controls and in 78 percent of patients with cirrhosis. Liver span estimated by clinical exam was 11.8 cm in patients with cirrhosis and 9.5 cm in controls, whereas ultrasound-measured liver span was 10.9 and 12.4 cm, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A similar study from a rural Indian hospital showed that there was poor interobserver agreement among three clinicians who detected hepatomegaly by palpation of lower liver edge and by percussion for liver span. In addition, clinical estimates of liver span correlated poorly with findings on ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H468980579\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasonography is an accurate method for determining liver size. In an autopsy study of 36 patients who had undergone ultrasonography within one month of death, ultrasound was 87 percent accurate in determining whether hepatomegaly was present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H468980586\"><span class=\"h2\">Cross-sectional imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to determine liver size and volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Volumetric assessment traditionally has required manual contour tracing, segmentation of the organ in question, and application of mathematical algorithms to determine the volume. However, automated techniques have been developed that reduce the need for manual input, and thus the time needed to calculate volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Automated techniques appear to correlate well with manual contour tracing for volume determination (correlation coefficient of 0.98 in one MRI study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>CT is routinely used to measure total liver volume and segmental liver volume as part of the preoperative assessment for partial liver resections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Early studies using cadaveric livers showed that there was minimal discrepancy (&lt;5 percent) between liver volume assessed by CT scan and water displacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>CT has also been used to determine liver volume in patients with cirrhosis and chronic liver disease. One study using CT found that liver volume decreases with increasing Child-Pugh score in patients with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Liver volume appears to vary depending on the etiology of liver disease. Patients with cholestatic liver disease have larger livers than those with <span class=\"nowrap\">alcoholic/viral</span> hepatitis, while those with cryptogenic cirrhosis have the smallest livers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62208353\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatomegaly occurs mainly as a consequence of pathologic conditions, though there are settings in which a normal liver may be palpable on examination.

Some causes of hepatic inflammation include infection (viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic), drug toxicity, ischemia, alcoholic steatohepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and autoimmune hepatitis. As an example, in a study of patients with acute hepatitis A or E infection, 23 to 33 percent of patients had hepatomegaly at the time of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatomegaly-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

In patients with cirrhosis, there may be shrinkage of the enlarged liver with compensatory hypertrophy of the left lobe of the liver, which can be easily missed if palpation is only performed in the right upper quadrant.

Disorders of lipid metabolism may be seen in alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. The accumulation of triglycerides results from excess delivery to and decreased export of free fatty acids from the liver. In addition, there is impaired beta oxidation of fatty acids within the liver. The accumulation of triglycerides results in fatty liver disease and hepatomegaly.

This may be seen with Budd-Chiari syndrome, right heart failure, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (hepatic veno-occlusive disease), and peliosis hepatis. All of these disorders lead to passive congestion of the liver, resulting in hepatomegaly with a firm, smooth, and tender liver edge. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18910515\"><span class=\"h3\">Budd-Chiari syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Budd-Chiari syndrome can be defined as any pathophysiologic process that results in an interruption or diminution of the normal flow of blood out of the liver. However, as commonly used, Budd-Chiari syndrome implies thrombosis of the hepatic veins <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the intrahepatic or suprahepatic inferior vena cava. An alternative nomenclature that recognizes an obliterative process involving principally the inferior vena cava (&quot;obliterative hepatocavopathy&quot;) has also been proposed. The term Budd-Chiari syndrome is usually distinguished from two other conditions that interfere with hepatic venous flow: sinusoidal obstruction syndrome and right heart failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-the-budd-chiari-syndrome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of the Budd-Chiari syndrome&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>Budd-Chiari syndrome is more common in women and usually presents in the third or fourth decade of life. Signs and symptoms may include right upper quadrant pain and jaundice. However, patients with chronic disease may be asymptomatic. With complete obstruction of the hepatic veins, caudate lobe compensatory hypertrophy may develop because venous drainage of the caudate lobe is frequently spared. The hypertrophied caudate lobe can eventually compress the intrahepatic portion of the inferior vena cava, leading to further outflow obstruction, accompanied by the development of ascites and lower extremity edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18910522\"><span class=\"h3\">Right heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with passive congestion of the liver from right heart failure may have right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and anorexia.

Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome typically occurs in the context of hematopoietic cell transplantation. However, it may also be induced by the ingestion of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, usually from herbal sources (such as bush tea and other herbal teas), by high-dose radiation therapy to the liver (usually exceeding 30 Gy) without cytoreductive chemotherapy, by radioembolization of liver tumors, and by liver transplantation. As sinusoidal pressure increases, sinusoidal dilatation, central congestion, and hepatomegaly develop. Long-standing congestion can cause centrilobular fibrosis, leading to cirrhosis.
