These drugs have anti-inflammatory actions, and they are effective for inducing and maintaining remission in mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Their efficacy in Crohn disease is more controversial. Sulfasalazine appears to be effective in controlling active Crohn colitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulcerative-colitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Ulcerative colitis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=crohn-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Crohn disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sulfasalazine is also used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rheumatoid-arthritis-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Rheumatoid arthritis treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=axial-spondyloarthritis-including-ankylosing-spondylitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Axial spondyloarthritis, including ankylosing spondylitis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriatic-arthritis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Psoriatic arthritis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disease-modifying-antirheumatic-drugs-dmards-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In many cases, sulfasalazine or a 5-aminosalicylate must be taken for a long period of time. These medications can have side effects ranging from mild to serious. Many of the mild side effects can be avoided by using lower doses of these drugs; the serious side effects are uncommon or rare, and usually resolve when the medication is stopped. In most cases, the potential benefits of these drugs outweigh the potential risks. Nonetheless, it is important to be aware of the possible side effects before starting treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SULFASALAZINE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">How it works</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sulfasalazine acts locally in the colon to decrease inflammation. It also works throughout the body by inhibiting the formation of a chemical known as prostaglandins. Prostaglandins have several important functions in the body, one of which is control of pain and inflammation.</p><p>Sulfasalazine is a <span class=\"nowrap\">yellow/orange</span> color; patients who take it may notice that their urine, tears, and sweat develop an orange tinge, which can stain clothing and contact lenses. Patients should drink plenty of fluids while on therapy and avoid taking the drug on an empty stomach or with antacids. Sulfasalazine can affect folate absorption, so patients should take folic acid (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> while taking the medication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major side effects of sulfasalazine can be classified according to how frequently the side effect occurs: commonly, uncommonly, and rarely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Common side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common side effects of sulfasalazine are headache, nausea, fever, rash, and reversible infertility in men. </p><p>Headache is one of the most common complaints, affecting up to one-third of people. Headaches are more likely with higher doses of the drug, and are less likely to occur if the dose is gradually increased. Loss of appetite, nausea, sensitivity to sunlight, and nervousness are also common when starting therapy. Sperm count may be reduced in men who take sulfasalazine, although this is reversible once the drug is stopped.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Uncommon side effect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) is an uncommon side effect of sulfasalazine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Rare side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rare and potentially serious side effects of sulfasalazine (affecting less than 1 percent of people who take this drug) include inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), inflammation of the lung (pneumonitis), a serious skin reaction called Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis).</p><p>Rarely, there is a decrease in the number of infection fighting white blood cells. In some cases, the bone marrow completely stops producing a specific type of white blood cells, a condition called agranulocytosis. Agranulocytosis usually occurs within two months of starting sulfasalazine and is usually accompanied by a fever and rash. In most people, agranulocytosis resolves within one or two weeks of stopping the medication. Testing to monitor the blood count is recommended in all patients on sulfasalazine. This should be performed every one to two weeks for the first six weeks, monthly for three months, and then every three months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Sulfasalazine and sulfa allergies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who are allergic to sulfa drugs may have a cross reaction to sulfasalazine and should therefore not take it. If sulfasalazine produces mild allergic symptoms but very effectively controls symptoms, desensitization, a method to reduce or eliminate the allergic reaction, may be attempted. Desensitization uses a very small dose of sulfasalazine initially, and gradually increases the dose over time. This strategy is not commonly done for people with inflammatory bowel disease since other treatments are available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Sulfasalazine during pregnancy and breastfeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who wish to become pregnant can continue taking sulfasalazine during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. Sulfasalazine does not increase the risk of any complications of pregnancy or the risk of birth defects. Pregnant patients taking sulfasalazine should increase their folate supplementation to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/</span> day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">5-AMINOSALICYLATES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">How they work</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sulfasalazine is a molecule that has two components: 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA) and sulfapyridine. The sulfapyridine is responsible for many of the side effects of sulfasalazine, while the 5-ASA is responsible for many of its beneficial effects in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. This discovery provided a rationale for the development of a drug that contains only the 5-ASA component. Unfortunately, the sulfapyridine component is necessary for the beneficial effects of sulfasalazine in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; thus the 5-ASA drugs are not suitable for those patients.</p><p>Several formulations of the 5-ASA drugs are available (eg, Delzicol, Asacol HD, Pentasa, Dipentum, Colazal, Apriso, and Lialda). These differ in the specific formulation of 5-ASA, how many times per day they are taken, and the way the pills dissolve in particular parts of the bowel.</p><p>Overall, the 5-ASA drugs have fewer side effects than sulfasalazine. However, about 20 percent of people who have side effects while taking sulfasalazine will have similar side effects while taking 5-ASA drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Common side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common side effects of the 5-ASA drugs (occurring in more than 10 percent of people) include headache and malaise (a vague feeling of illness), cramps and gas. Watery diarrhea is fairly common with one of the 5-ASA formulations (Dipentum), occurring in about 15 percent of people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Uncommon side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uncommon side effects include hair loss, skin rash, and a worsening of inflammation of the colon (colitis); these occur in 1 to 10 percent of people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Rare side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rare side effects affect less than 1 percent of people, but are potentially serious. They include inflammation of the lung (pneumonitis), inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart (pericarditis), and inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). Inflammation of the kidney (interstitial nephritis) can also occur, although this can usually be detected with routine blood tests performed at six weeks and at six months after starting a 5-ASA medication, and yearly thereafter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">5-aminosalicylates during pregnancy and breastfeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies suggest that the 5-ASA drugs are safe when taken during pregnancy and breastfeeding and that women should continue taking these drugs during this time. However, women who take 5-ASA medications should speak to their clinician before trying to conceive. Asacol HD has dibutyl phthalate (DBP) in the coating, which is not be safe for use during pregnancy. The manufacturer of Asacol HD is changing the preparation to no longer include DBP, but until that is complete, patients should be switched to a different 5-ASA during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=2018\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
