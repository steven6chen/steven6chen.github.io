Along with <em>Giardia</em>, it is among the most common parasitic enteric pathogens in humans. The organisms infect and reproduce in the epithelial cells of the digestive or respiratory tracts. Infection is predominantly associated with diarrhea and biliary tract disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis.

There are about 20 species of <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, including species that infect mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. <em>C. parvum</em> (4 mcm diameter) is the main species responsible for clinical disease in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. <em>C. parvum</em> has been divided into two separate species: <em>C. hominis</em> (previously <em>C. parvum</em> genotype 1) and <em>C. parvum</em> (previously <em>C. parvum</em> genotype 2). <em>C. hominis</em> apparently infects mainly humans, while <em>C. parvum</em> is frequently found in a number of other animals as well as in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>The host range for many species seems to be quite variable, and <em>C. felis</em>, <em>C. muris</em>, <em>C. canis</em>, <em>C. suis</em>, and <em>C. meleagridis</em> have also been identified in some individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/1,3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,7</a>].

Whether this is due in part to increased availability and application of diagnostic assays is unclear. In the European Union, Cryptosporidiosis is a notifiable disease and outbreaks have been reported in several countries, including Denmark, Nordic countries, England, and Scotland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. </p><p>However, infection is most common in countries that have increased crowding and poor sanitary conditions. As an example, <em>Cryptosporidium</em> is present in 1 to 3 percent of immunocompetent patients with diarrhea in industrialized countries and 7 to 10 percent in developing countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. In addition, seroprevalence rates are approximately 25 to 60 percent in the United States compared with 65 to 95 percent in some developing countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The prevalence is also higher in patients with AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>], and in one report, the prevalence was increased in dairy farmers, probably because <em>C. parvum</em> causes diarrhea in cattle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>Although outbreaks occur worldwide in all age groups, it is more frequent in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/12,14,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,30-32</a>]. In a study of almost 9500 children in Africa and Asia seeking care for diarrhea, <em>Cryptosporidium</em> was identified as one of the four major contributors to moderate-to-severe diarrheal diseases during the first two years of life, and was second only to rotavirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Among such children, it was also associated with a two to three times higher risk of mortality compared with controls without diarrhea. </p><p>In the United States, cases are most frequently reported in children aged one to nine years, and to a lesser degree in adults aged 25 to 29 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

As an example, population-based laboratory surveillance data from Canada have shown <em>Cryptosporidium</em> spp infection to occur at an overall rate of 6.0 per 100,000 populations per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]; however, the incidence was significantly higher in children than in adults (17.8 per 100,000 per year occurring among those aged &lt;20 years of age, compared to 1.25 per 100,000 per year for adults &ge;20 years of age [RR 14.29; 95% CI 9.77-21.11; p&lt;0.0001]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83839487\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors for severe disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of severe <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prolonged disease is increased in patients with cellular and humoral immune deficiencies (eg, HIV infection, organ transplantation, IgA deficiency, hypogammaglobulinemia, receiving immunosuppressive therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, the number of cases of cryptosporidiosis has been declining among HIV patients, largely because of immune reconstitution with highly active antiretroviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fecally passed <em>Cryptosporidium</em> oocysts are immediately infectious to those who ingest them.

The extent of this outbreak may actually have been underappreciated; antibody determinations to two <em>C. parvum</em> antigens were made in children 6 months to 12 years of age who had routine lead screening performed during March to May of 1993 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The prevalence of antibodies during a five-week period rose from 15 to 82 percent and 17 to 87 percent in two southern zip codes in the city, which were close to the implicated water treatment plant. Another outbreak was associated with a local water park involving more than 350 cases was reported from Illinois in 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

The organisms cause a secretory diarrhea that can be associated with malabsorption. It is likely that the intracellular nature of the infection interferes with intestinal absorption and secretion. The organisms can spread via the intestinal lumen to involve the biliary system, where they can cause stricturing and cholangitis. No specific toxin has been identified, although one study of young children in Haiti demonstrated the increased presence of systemic and intestinal proinflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-8) compared to healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].

Progressive morphological and functional abnormalities of the small intestine occur as parasite numbers increase, although intensity of infection and inflammation does not correlate well with the severity of clinical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Whether differences in the organism's virulence or the level of host immunity primarily account for the variable course of infection in different people is not well understood.</p><p>The immune response associated with cryptosporidiosis involves cellular and humoral components. The T-lymphocyte cellular responses are important in controlling infection, as evidenced by the increased disease severity in HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>.</p><p>Specific IgM, IgG, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> IgA responses develop during infection. Epidemiologic evidence for protective immunity to <em>Cryptosporidium</em> has been suggested by the observation that residents in areas where <em>Cryptosporidium</em> is endemic have milder symptoms with subsequent infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/37,76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,76,77</a>].

The sporozoites mature asexually into meronts, which release merozoites intraluminally. These can reinvade host cells, resulting in autoinfection, or can undergo sexual maturation to form new oocytes which can excyst within the host gastrointestinal tract or can pass out into the environment.

For example, in a cross-sectional study of 230 HIV-infected patients in Peru, infection with <em>C. hominis</em> was associated with diarrhea alone while infection with <em>C. parvum</em> was associated with diarrhea and vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p>A number of other clinical manifestations of cryptosporidiosis in AIDS patients have been described, including cholecystitis, cholangitis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, and respiratory tract involvement. Biliary tract involvement affects 10 to 30 percent of patients with AIDS and can result in acalculous cholecystitis, sclerosing cholangitis, and pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,90</a>]. Symptoms include right upper quadrant pain and fever.

Nonspecific respiratory symptoms including cough have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,94</a>]. Disseminated cryptosporidiosis has not been described.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of laboratory abnormalities depends upon the severity and duration of infection.</p><p>The serum alkaline phosphatase may be elevated in patients with biliary tract involvement. In such patients, ultrasound and CT imaging may show an enlarged gallbladder with a thickened wall and dilated intra- and extrahepatic biliary ducts. Diagnosis of biliary involvement is confirmed by histology or by examination of bile for oocysts, since stool specimens may or may not be positive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-cholangiopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS cholangiopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with severe, protracted disease can have evidence of malabsorption. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of malabsorption&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis is generally made by microscopy, polymerase chain reaction, or enzyme immunoassays (EIA). The organisms may be present in stool, duodenal aspirates, bile secretions, biopsy specimens from affected gastrointestinal tissue, or respiratory secretions. </p><p>Specific details regarding microscopy and other diagnostic methods are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Microscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis is generally based upon microscopy since <em>Cryptosporidium</em> species cannot be cultivated in vitro. The laboratory should be alerted to the potential diagnosis and specific stains for the organisms should be requested, since routine examination for ova and parasites usually does not detect cryptosporidia spores. Specimens can be examined fresh or formalin-fixed, by light or phase-contrast microscopy. Modified acid-fast stains are usually used, although the organisms also can be seen using hematoxylin and eosin, Giemsa, or malachite green staining. With the modified acid-fast stain, the oocysts stain red or pink and are usually 4 to 6 mcm in diameter. Light microscopy is unable to distinguish between genetically distinct parasites.</p><p>The accuracy of the acid-fast stain has not been well established but depends in part upon the number of stool specimens examined, since the number of oocysts shed in feces is not constant. In one report, examination of a single stool specimen identified only 30 percent of intestinal Cryptosporidia infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p>The number of specimens required to conclusively exclude the diagnosis has not been studied, but in chronic infections, examining up to three specimens is reasonable. Additionally, examination of unformed specimens and concentrated specimens increase the diagnostic yield. Fecal specimens usually lack leukocytes and erythrocytes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H355762128\"><span class=\"h2\">Polymerase chain reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When available, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is the diagnostic method of choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Compared with microscopy, this method is more sensitive and has the ability to differentiate between <em>Cryptosporidium</em> genotypes (which can be helpful in epidemiologic investigations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Monoclonal antibodies and enzyme immunoassays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monoclonal antibodies against the oocyst wall and antigen capture tests have been used in fluorescent assays (eg, Meridian Merifluor assay and the TechLab Crypto IF kit) to detect <em>Cryptosporidium</em> in fecal specimens or in tissue specimens. These techniques increase the sensitivity compared to routine light microscopy and are easy to perform [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptosporidiosis/abstract/98-101\" class=\"abstract_t\">98-101</a>].
