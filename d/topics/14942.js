Reflex syncope (previously termed neurally-mediated syncope) is TLOC due to a reflex response that encompasses vasodilatation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bradycardia (rarely tachycardia), leading to systemic hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Types of reflex syncope include vasovagal syncope, situational syncope, carotid sinus syncope, and some cases without apparent triggers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64301\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64301 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Vasovagal syncope is the most common cause of syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Vasovagal syncope may be suggested or diagnosed by a specific history with well-known triggers, but a classic history is not required. Acute vasovagal reactions leading to syncope or presyncope are common also in a number of stressful settings, such as blood donation. The diagnosis can also be suggested by exclusion of other causes of syncope and by a characteristic response to upright tilt table testing during which the patient may become syncopal. In these cases, the syncope is due to hypotension which may be caused by severe bradycardia, vascular dilation (vasodepressor effect), or both. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-procedures-and-processes-to-enhance-safety-for-the-blood-recipient-and-the-blood-donor#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Procedures and processes to enhance safety for the blood recipient and the blood donor&quot;, section on 'Vasovagal syncope'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation of patients with vasovagal syncope and situational syncope will be reviewed here.

Both neural (arterial and cardiac baroreceptor, including carotid sinus reflexes) and endogenous chemical pathways are thought to be involved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80233\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80233 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The most frequent mechanism for reflex syncope is a mixed cardioinhibitory response combining cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor features, although an individual patient may have syncopal events characterized principally by vasodepressor, cardioinhibitory, or mixed responses. Typically the episodes can vary in their presentation for any individual such that asystole may occur at one time and hypotension at another. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1383552\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alterations in autonomic activation are responsible for reflex syncope. Vasovagal syncope may be caused by autonomic cardioinhibitory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vasodilator responses. Three types of responses are seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardioinhibitory response</strong> &ndash; The cardioinhibitory response results from increased parasympathetic activation and may be manifested by any or all of the following: sinus bradycardia, PR interval prolongation, advanced atrioventricular block, or asystole.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vasodepressor response</strong> &ndash; The vasodepressor response is due to inhibition of (decreased) sympathetic activity and can lead to symptomatic hypotension even in the absence of severe bradycardia. In one report, for example, the final trigger for symptomatic hypotension appeared to be the abrupt disappearance of muscle sympathetic nerve activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Reduced cardiopulmonary baroreceptor sensitivity may be a contributing factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mixed response</strong> &ndash; The mixed response contains components of both the cardioinhibitory response and the vasodepressor response.</p><p/><p>In one cohort of 111 patients with presumed vasovagal syncope who received an implantable loop recorder and were followed for 3 to 15 months, 34 percent experienced recurrent syncope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A correlation between syncope and electrocardiographic changes was found in 84 percent, with the most frequent abnormality (seen in 50 percent) being one or more prolonged asystolic pauses, primarily due to sinus arrest. Bradycardia (&lt;40 beats per minute) without pauses was seen in 9 percent, while the remaining patients had normal sinus rhythm or sinus tachycardia and probably had a vasodepressor response. However, ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) recorders do not offer insight into possible concomitant vasodepressor activity. Consequently, merely observing a slow heart rate is insufficient to assume that the faint was solely cardioinhibitory in nature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Autonomic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autonomic dysfunction contributes to reflex syncope, particularly in those whose presentation does not include the usual premonitory symptoms, and is often associated with cardiovascular or neurologic disorders, which may include orthostatic or postprandial hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Autonomic dysfunction is also thought to play a role in some vasovagal syncope, but vasovagal syncope also occurs without apparent autonomic dysfunction. </p><p>Reflexes initiated in various arterial and cardiac baroreceptors and carotid sinus reflexes may be involved (in the past, the term Bezold-Jarisch reflex has been used, but it is now best abandoned as it does not fully express the complex pathophysiology) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients may have increased muscle sympathetic nerve activity at rest and a blunted response to orthostatic stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Baroreceptor reflexes</strong> &ndash; Receptors in the atria, great veins, and left ventricle exist whose activation results in reflex bradycardia and vasodilation. Activation of these mechanoreceptors (including those in the left ventricle and stretch receptors in the great vessels) with pressure or volume changes (as may occur with sympathetic stimulation) activate afferent C fibers to the midbrain; such stimulation may result in activation of vagal afferents and then vagal efferents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Carotid sinus reflex</strong> &ndash; Blood pressure and heart rate are normally controlled in part by input from baroreceptors located within the carotid sinus and aortic arch. An increase in blood pressure or pressure applied to the carotid sinus enhances the baroreceptor firing rate and activates vagal activity, thereby slowing the heart rate and reducing the blood pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Central serotonergic pathways</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been argued that central serotonergic pathways may participate in the pathogenesis of vasovagal syncope, but the evidence is weak, and serotonin re-uptake inhibition is not routinely very helpful for prevention of attacks. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Adenosine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Adenosine</a> has a variety of actions, including negative chronotropic and inotropic activity and vasodepression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Adenosine release, perhaps mediated by mechanoreceptors in the heart, may be involved in the triggering mechanism of syncope, at least during tilt testing. The observation that adenosine administration can provoke reflex syncope raises the possibility that endogenous adenosine plays a role in the pathogenesis of vasovagal syncope. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2305727192\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF REFLEX SYNCOPE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1383393\"><span class=\"h2\">Vasovagal syncope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vasovagal syncope (also known as the &quot;common faint&quot;) refers to a variety of clinical scenarios in which a neural reflex results in usually self-limited systemic hypotension characterized by bradycardia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peripheral vasodilation. It is the most common cause of syncope (approximately 35 to 70 percent of cases depending on the age group being evaluated), particularly in patients without apparent cardiovascular or neurologic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/11-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-17</a>]. However, vasovagal syncope remains the most common cause of syncope even among patients with heart disease and should be considered as a potential cause in such patients after more worrisome causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81820\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81820 \">table 2</a>) have been excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

However, other potential causes of syncope should be considered, particularly if the syncope occurs during exertion (ie, during &quot;full flight&quot; not during the post exercise cooling down period). Athletes with syncope during physical activity should be evaluated for underlying structural heart disease, which, if present, increases potential risk of sudden death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=athletes-with-arrhythmias-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Athletes with arrhythmias: Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3028049025\"><span class=\"h2\">Situational syncope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Situational syncope refers to syncope associated with specific scenarios. Some situations (eg, post-micturition, post-tussive, etc) appear to trigger a neural reflex; others (eg, straining, squatting) may cause syncope via additional mechanisms unrelated to neural reflexes. Avoidance of trigger situations is the first step in prevention of recurrences.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features associated with a syncopal event are important and may be diagnostic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55096\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55096 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66884\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66884 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/1,2,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,18,19</a>]. Patients with vasovagal syncope are often young and otherwise healthy. In younger persons, vasovagal syncope is usually associated with a prodrome of nausea, pallor, and diaphoresis, consistent with increased vagal tone. Typical triggers and premonitory symptoms are strongly suggestive of vasovagal syncope, although these may be absent or difficult to correlate to the syncopal episode in some individuals, particularly in older adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3202341681\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic prodromal symptoms associated with imminent syncope and presyncope, particularly in the case of the vasovagal form of reflex syncope, include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lightheadedness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A feeling of being warm or cold </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpitations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or non-specific abdominal discomfort </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual &quot;blurring&quot; occasionally proceeding to temporary darkening or &quot;white-out&quot; of vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminution of hearing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> occurrence of unusual sounds (particularly a &quot;whooshing&quot; noise)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pallor reported by onlookers</p><p/><p>Reflex syncope typically occurs in the sitting or standing position, as the supine position helps to maintain adequate blood flow to the brain. Typically, reflex syncope is short in duration (one to two minutes), but full recovery may be delayed as the patient may feel fatigued for an extended period following the event. This course may help distinguish vasovagal syncope from syncope associated with arrhythmia, which is typically of abrupt onset and of short duration but without autonomic-mediated prodrome or post-episode fatigue. Loss of consciousness may be prolonged with some other causes of TLOC, such as seizures and aortic stenosis, but rarely with vasovagal syncope.

In older patients, patients with syncope during exertion, and other patients who may have structural heart disease, potential causes of syncope other than reflex syncope must be considered.

However, older patients may also be diagnosed with vasovagal syncope but may not have typical premonitory symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The &quot;classical&quot; of &quot;typical&quot; presentation of vasovagal syncope refers to syncope triggered by emotional or orthostatic stress, painful or noxious stimuli, fear of bodily injury, prolonged standing, heat exposure, or after physical exertion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The &quot;atypical&quot; (also referred to as &quot;non-classical&quot;) presentation of vasovagal syncope occurs in some patients, especially those who are older, who have recurrent episodes of syncope without an identifiable cause or trigger. </p><p/><p>Situation syncope may be triggered by a variety of scenarios, including micturition, coughing, defecating, swallowing, etc.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3173978047\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reflex syncope can be a recurrent problem, depending on the particular individual and triggers. However, a significant minority of patients will do well without any further episodes. A study of self-reported symptom burden in 418 patients diagnosed with vasovagal syncope indicated that 35 percent were symptom free at median five-year follow-up, regardless of presenting symptom or treatment received [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H314004146\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation of patients with suspected transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) due to reflex syncope serves both diagnostic and prognostic purposes. For nearly all patients, the initial evaluation of suspected reflex syncope should include obtaining a comprehensive history, performance of a physical examination (which may include careful carotid sinus massage in older patients), and review of an electrocardiogram. Additional diagnostic evaluation, if indicated, should be individualized based upon the suspected etiology of syncope, but is rarely needed in patients with suspected reflex syncope. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H14005354\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1995214298\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obtaining a detailed medical history is the first step in determining whether syncope is reflex syncope or due to some other cause. If the history obtained is thorough, the story provided by the patient (and witnesses, if any) will often reveal the most likely cause of syncope and will provide a means of guiding subsequent testing and treatment. However, history taking is highly dependent upon the experience of the clinician, and in addition depends on the whether the patient and witnesses can give an accurate account of events (which may be limited in patients who are very young, very elderly, uncomfortable [eg, pain], intoxicated, or in whom a language barrier exists).</p><p>Key points from the medical history include (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syncope-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syncope in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Medical history'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Number, frequency, and duration of episodes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated symptoms preceding syncope (ie, prodromal symptoms)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient position at the time of syncope</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Triggers or provocative factors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated symptoms following syncope</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Witnessed signs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre-existing medical conditions, medications, and family history</p><p/><p>Syncope precipitated by emotional distress or orthostatic stress and associated with typical prodrome is suggestive but not diagnostic of vasovagal syncope. Further evaluation with tilt table test is not usually indicated if diagnostic vasovagal features are identified and further testing will not alter treatment. However, reproduction of symptoms may help patients believe that the clinician has observed a spell and therefore is better positioned to care for the patient. </p><p>Recent history may be more helpful than lifetime history in predicting vasovagal syncope recurrence. In a study of 208 subjects with a positive tilt test and &ge;3 lifetime syncope spells, the number of vasovagal syncope spells in the preceding year better predicted syncope recurrence than total number of historical spells (likelihood ratio statistic 28.4 versus 20.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3661017202\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of findings on physical examination can aid in the identification of some of the common causes of syncope, including abnormalities in the vital signs, cardiovascular abnormalities, and less frequently neurological signs.

The primary factor determining whether the patient with presumed syncope should be hospitalized is the individual's immediate mortality risk, with secondary issues including the potential for physical injury (eg, fall risk) and, to a lesser extent, the issue of whether certain treatments require hospital monitoring for safe initiation. The risk stratification of patients with syncope is discussed in detail separately.

Patients with reflex syncope most often have no evidence of structural heart disease and have a normal baseline ECG, although patients with these conditions can also experience reflex syncope. Reflex syncope is considered relatively benign with regard to the risk of early mortality or recurrent syncope resulting in injury, but not necessarily with regard to falls and injury.

In patients with more frequent reflex syncope, relatively short-term (one month) non-invasive electrocardiographic monitoring (eg, an event [loop] recorder) may suffice. Since syncopal episodes often occur less frequently (eg, less than once per month), longer-term monitoring options may be required and can significantly improve the diagnostic yield over shorter-term monitoring.</p><p>The implantable loop recorder (ILR) is a subcutaneous monitoring device for the detection of cardiac arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Laboratory testing is used mainly to support a clinical suspicion. There are no testing procedures that are sensitive or specific enough to definitively establish a diagnosis on their own; laboratory findings must be compatible with the history in order to be diagnostically useful.

Typical triggers and premonitory symptoms are strongly suggestive of vasovagal syncope. Situational syncope is usually diagnosed with the same prodromal symptoms as are seen in vasovagal syncope based on the setting of a specific scenario or trigger, such as micturition, coughing, defecating, or swallowing.

Reflex syncope (previously termed neurally-mediated syncope) is TLOC due to a reflex response that encompasses vasodilatation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bradycardia (rarely tachycardia), leading to systemic hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion. Types of reflex syncope include vasovagal syncope, situational syncope, carotid sinus syncope, and some cases without apparent triggers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64301\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64301 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carotid-sinus-hypersensitivity-and-carotid-sinus-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carotid sinus hypersensitivity and carotid sinus syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most frequent mechanism for reflex syncope is a mixed cardioinhibitory response, although an individual patient may have syncopal events characterized principally by vasodepressor, cardioinhibitory, or mixed responses. The cardioinhibitory response results from increased parasympathetic activation and may be manifested by sinus bradycardia, PR interval prolongation, advanced atrioventricular block, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> asystole. The vasodepressor response is due to decreased sympathetic activity and can lead to symptomatic hypotension even in the absence of severe bradycardia. The mixed response contains components of both the cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor responses. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of reflex syncope'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical features associated with a syncopal event are important and may be diagnostic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55096\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55096 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66884\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66884 \">table 4</a>). In younger persons, vasovagal syncope is usually associated with a prodrome of nausea, pallor, and diaphoresis, consistent with increased vagal tone, although these may be absent or difficult to correlate to the syncopal episode in some individuals, particularly in older adults. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation of patients with suspected TLOC due to reflex syncope serves both diagnostic and prognostic purposes. For nearly all patients, the initial evaluation of suspected reflex syncope should include obtaining a comprehensive history, performance of a physical examination (which may include careful carotid sinus massage in older patients), and review of an electrocardiogram (ECG). Additional diagnostic evaluation is rarely needed in patients with suspected reflex syncope. (See <a href=\"#H314004146\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most cases, when the collapse is thought to be reflex syncope, patients are considered to be at low risk of near-term mortality or recurrent syncope. Reflex syncope is considered relatively benign with regard to the risk of early mortality or recurrent syncope resulting in injury, but not necessarily with regard to falls and injury. Most of the time these patients can be treated and discharged home for further outpatient evaluation as needed. (See <a href=\"#H1659194824\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a certain diagnosis of reflex syncope generally do not require further diagnostic evaluation, although on occasion one confirmatory test may be warranted. For patients with suspected reflex syncope after the initial evaluation, particularly for patients with an atypical presentation of suspected reflex syncope, specific confirmatory testing utilizing upright tilt table testing or ambulatory ECG monitoring is warranted in order to solidify the diagnosis, or conversely to exclude the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H2959828014\" class=\"local\">'Selected additional testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1307132557\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Brian Olshansky, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reflex-syncope-in-adults-and-adolescents-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Task Force for the Diagnosis and Management of Syncope, European Society of Cardiology (ESC), European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), et al.
