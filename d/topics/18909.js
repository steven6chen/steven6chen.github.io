As the prevalence of Zika virus infection is decreasing, the likelihood of false positive laboratory testing and the subsequent use of unnecessary intervention is increased. However, after discussion of the risks and expected outcomes of testing and local public health recommendations, some patients may choose to be tested based on personal values and preferences. If testing is performed, it should be conducted similar to that for symptomatic women using the time frame from the last possible exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Fetal ultrasonography is indicated in certain situations. (See <a href=\"#H3171750065\" class=\"local\">'Fetal ultrasonography'</a> below.) If the fetus has ultrasound findings suggesting congenital Zika syndrome, maternal testing with NAT and IgM are indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic women with <strong>ongoing</strong> possible Zika virus exposure (those who reside in or travel at least weekly to an area with mosquito transmission) warrant testing: NAT three times during pregnancy is suggested (at initial prenatal visit and two more times) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The optimal frequency of testing is unclear. Limiting NAT testing to the first and second trimesters improves early identification of infection, but would miss infections acquired in the third trimester, which also can impact offspring. Local levels of Zika virus transmission and laboratory capacity impact this decision. Confirmation of maternal infection can impact the frequency and focus of ultrasound examination as well as decision-making about possible pregnancy termination. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H627983657\"><span class=\"h4\">CDC interactive web tool</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CDC has created an interactive <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/zika/hc-providers/testing-for-zikavirus.html&amp;token=j9DpKlpYekkhgpg/lo+NpkAIr2IX0s/nt1fbBvcMqpJLeLg0v3foR2oNHGnumYFfDpqImbLeg1BJt8ag2/6Nddf4W7B1W98QziIyFKDI8qQ=&amp;TOPIC_ID=107211\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">web tool</a> (Pregnancy &amp; Zika Testing) to help health care providers in the United States apply recommendations for Zika virus testing, interpret results, and manage pregnant woman with possible exposure to Zika virus.

Pre-existing dengue antibodies due to past symptomatic or asymptomatic infection may yield false-positive Zika antibody results. Similarly, Zika virus antibodies also cross-react with dengue antibodies and may yield false-positive dengue antibody results. Diagnostic tests for these infections are discussed below and in more detail separately.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that obstetrical providers use laboratories that can perform combined Zika virus real time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) testing, rather than forwarding negative rRT-PCR specimens for additional testing in another lab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2609607943\"><span class=\"h5\">Specimen collection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum is required for all diagnostic algorithms.

The main challenge pertaining to laboratory testing for Zika virus is that the window period for Zika virus identification in blood or urine by polymerase chain reaction is relatively short (within the first two weeks of infection).

In the fetal brain, neuronal growth, proliferation, migration, and differentiation are disrupted, thus slowing and impairing normal brain development in utero and in infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>In the placenta, the virus primarily infects and replicates in placental macrophages (Hofbauer cells), and to a lesser extent cytotrophoblasts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Early gestational age and the Zika virus strain appear to impact the placenta's vulnerability to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Viral replication appears to induce type I interferon, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and antiviral gene expression.

However, it is clear that the risk for vertical transmission exists throughout pregnancy and in offspring of both symptomatic and asymptomatic mothers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women/abstract/18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-23</a>]. </p><p>The frequency of birth defects resulting from vertical transmission of Zika virus is also uncertain. Severity of maternal symptoms and signs, maternal virus load, and pre-existing dengue antibodies do not appear to be predictors of infant outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The greatest risk of serious <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/newborn</span> sequelae appears to be with first- or second-trimester infection, but serious <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/newborn</span> sequelae also occur with third-trimester infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women/abstract/19,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,26-28</a>]. </p><p>Estimates of the overall risk of any birth defect or abnormality among fetuses and infants of women infected with Zika virus during pregnancy vary widely, likely reflecting differences in study design (eg, population studied, thoroughness of ascertainment of infant outcomes, criteria for congenital infection). Two examples are illustrated below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study from Rio de Janeiro followed 134 women with confirmed Zika virus infection during pregnancy and 73 women who were not infected (though 42 percent of these women were infected with chikungunya virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Pregnancy outcomes were available for 125 and 61 women, respectively:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The rate of fetal loss among Zika virus-infected women was 7 percent, similar to the rate in uninfected women. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among 117 live-born infants of Zika virus-infected women, the overall rate of adverse findings was 42 percent, and included abnormal brain imaging (24 percent), abnormal neurologic examination (21 percent), small for gestational age (9 percent), ocular abnormalities (7 percent), dysphagia (3 percent), microcephaly (3 percent), abnormal hearing assessment (3 percent), abnormal EEG <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinical seizures (3 percent), and other dysmorphisms (10 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adverse outcomes were noted in 55 percent of pregnancies after first trimester maternal infection, 52 percent after second trimester maternal infection, and 29 percent after third trimester maternal infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Important strengths of this study are that it was prospective, the infant population was carefully examined (eg, brain imaging studies [CT, MRI] were offered for infants born to mothers who had positive PCR results for ZIKV even in the absence of a structural birth defect), and all other arboviral infections were ruled out at the time the patients presented). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Further analysis of this cohort revealed a lack of association between maternal disease severity (signs, symptoms, virus load) or prior dengue infection and adverse birth outcome defined as fetal loss or a live infant with grossly abnormal clinical or brain imaging findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified 2549 pregnant women with Zika virus infection in Puerto Rico and other US territories between January 1, 2016 and April 25, 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Confirmed first trimester Zika virus infection (positive nucleic acid test) was associated with an 8 percent incidence of <span class=\"nowrap\">fetuses/infants</span> with birth defects, compared with 5 percent and 4 percent in the second and third trimesters, respectively. However, not all infants in this cohort had CNS imaging, and several important outcomes have not been reported, such as the number of infants with seizures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> visual impairment or hearing loss without a structural birth defect. Therefore, these figures likely understate the true risk of any congenital adverse outcome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An important finding is that structural birth defects were seen with similar frequency in infants born to women with and without clinical symptoms of ZIKV infection during pregnancy, as reported by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It should be noted that in the United States, the baseline frequency of birth defects similar to those potentially related to Zika virus infection was already 2.86 of 1000 live births before the introduction of Zika virus, according to one study that included neural tube defects (a potential feature of congenital Zika virus infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

The lack of microcephaly in some cases is due to hydrocephalus, which keeps the skull expanded despite the relatively small amount of brain tissue present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Zika virus has been linked to both disproportionate and proportionate microcephaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Proportionate microcephaly in Zika virus-affected infants has been identified in those who are small for gestational age, a finding also described in Zika virus congenital syndrome. In proportionate microcephaly, the reduced head circumference is proportionate to the accompanying (and reduced) weight and height parameters. Disproportionate microcephaly, on the other hand, is not accompanied by equally reduced weight or height parameters; the reduction in head circumference is not proportional to the other anthropometric measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. We have observed that if the brain structures are intact, infants with proportionate microcephaly seem to have a better prognosis than infants with disproportionate microcephaly, but further follow-up of large numbers of infants is required to make any firm conclusions.</p><p>All estimates of microcephaly risk are uncertain because available data are very limited due to poor ascertainment of infection rates (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and rates of microcephaly. As discussed above, estimates of the risk of microcephaly with in utero Zika virus exposure range from 1 to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women/abstract/26,28,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28,47</a>].

Further study is needed to confirm whether true variations in risk of the congenital syndrome exist, and if so, why. Higher rates of disease in congenitally infected infants in northeastern Brazil could be explained by a higher attack rate in the general population in that region. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3269484957\"><span class=\"h5\">Definition of Zika virus-related microcephaly</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no standard definition for diagnosis of microcephaly.

The sensitivity of amniocentesis for diagnosis of congenital Zika virus infection may be higher at &ge;21 weeks than earlier in pregnancy because, by analogy with other causes of congenital infection (such as cytomegalovirus and <em>Toxoplasma</em>), it is likely that Zika virus is not shed into amniotic fluid until sufficient time has elapsed following maternal viremia for the virus to breach the placental barrier; this is likely six to eight weeks after maternal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women/abstract/11,92-94\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,92-94</a>]. In addition, fetal kidney development must be sufficiently advanced to excrete the virus into the amniotic fluid (fetal urine production accounts for most of the amniotic fluid volume after 18 to 21 weeks of gestation). However, amniocentesis this late in gestation may not allow adequate time to arrange termination of pregnancy if desired because of positive results. Therefore, if amniocentesis is performed six to eight weeks after maternal infection and false-negative results are suspected, a repeat amniocentesis later in gestation may be considered. </p><p>A positive rRT-PCR result on amniotic fluid should be considered suggestive of fetal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-evaluation-and-management-of-pregnant-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.

(See <a href=\"#H1712381434\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of Zika virus infection in pregnant women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vertical transmission of Zika virus from mother to fetus during pregnancy has been associated with serious sequelae. The greatest risk of serious fetal sequelae is with first-trimester infection, but serious sequelae in offspring can occur after infection in any trimester. In a prospective report of symptomatic women in Brazil, adverse pregnancy outcomes occurred in 55 percent of first-trimester infections, 52 percent in second trimester infections, and 29 percent of third-trimester infections. CNS manifestations in Zika-affected infants appeared to occur in at least one-third to one-half of true (PCR confirmed) cases. (See <a href=\"#H603468848\" class=\"local\">'Congenital infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Health care providers should ask pregnant women about relevant past and ongoing epidemiologic exposure as a result of residence, travel, or unprotected sexual contact with a person at risk of infection, and about symptoms of Zika virus infection. (See <a href=\"#H1712381434\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of Zika virus infection in pregnant women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For evaluation of pregnant women with Zika virus exposure, we use the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) diagnostic approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F108362\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108362 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F113220\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113220 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F114067\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114067 \">algorithm 2</a>). The CDC recommends laboratory testing for pregnant women who are symptomatic or those with ongoing Zika exposure throughout pregnancy, and suggests using shared decision&ndash;making in asymptomatic women with limited exposure. (See <a href=\"#H1712381434\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of Zika virus infection in pregnant women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prenatal ultrasonography to evaluate for fetal abnormalities consistent with congenital Zika virus syndrome is recommended for all pregnant women with laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection. Pregnant women with possible exposure but without laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection during pregnancy should undergo ultrasound examination as recommended for routine prenatal care. (See <a href=\"#H3832608802\" class=\"local\">'Candidates'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The minimum time between occurrence of maternal Zika virus infection and development of sonographic signs suggestive of fetal infection is not known but may be as short as two weeks in some cases. In women infected early in pregnancy, ultrasound findings associated with fetal Zika virus infection may be detected as early as 18 to 20 weeks of gestation but are usually detected in the late second and early third trimester of pregnancy. A reasonable recommendation is to perform the first ultrasound examination four weeks from the suspected exposure, followed by serial ultrasound examinations every four weeks, ensuring that at least one ultrasound examination is performed between 28 and 33 weeks of gestation. The CDC has stated that clinicians may consider extending the time interval between ultrasound examinations in accordance with patient preferences and clinical judgment given that this recommendation is not based on data specific to congenital Zika virus infection. (See <a href=\"#H1878273060\" class=\"local\">'Timing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest offering amniocentesis to women who have fetal ultrasound findings suggestive of congenital Zika virus syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> positive or inconclusive maternal laboratory test results for Zika virus infection, when this information will impact decisions about pregnancy termination or ongoing pregnancy and delivery management. Zika virus rRT-PCR in amniotic fluid is diagnostic of fetal viral exposure, but not predictive of outcome. (See <a href=\"#H1559902871\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal (fetal) diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no specific treatment for Zika virus infection, and there is currently no vaccine for prevention. (See <a href=\"#H1053429363\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To protect against Zika virus infection, pregnant women should (see <a href=\"#H1237211505\" class=\"local\">'Guidance for pregnant women'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoid travel to areas with known mosquito transmission of Zika virus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adhere to mosquito protective measures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adhere to measures to protect against sexual transmission of Zika virus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adhere to recommendations regarding blood donation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adhere to recommendations for standard infection precautions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with Zika virus exposure may breastfeed.
