The epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prevention of VTE during pregnancy and the puerperium are discussed separately.

Anticoagulant therapy is discontinued if VTE is excluded.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When there is low or moderate clinical suspicion for PE, empiric anticoagulant therapy prior to diagnostic evaluation is determined on a case-by-case basis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those patients in whom PE is suspected but anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated, diagnostic evaluation should be expedited. Anticoagulation-independent therapy (eg, inferior vena cava filter) is indicated if VTE is confirmed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When there is suspicion for DVT alone (no clinical evidence or suspicion of acute PE), anticoagulant therapy is generally withheld until VTE is confirmed, assuming that diagnostic evaluation can be performed in a timely fashion.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTICOAGULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following approach is generally consistent with the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines on VTE and pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Once it is determined that anticoagulation is indicated, it should be initiated using subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> (IV UFH), or subcutaneous UFH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venous-thromboembolism-initiation-of-anticoagulation-first-10-days\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Venous thromboembolism: Initiation of anticoagulation (first 10 days)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Subcutaneous LMWH is preferred over IV UFH or subcutaneous UFH in most patients because it is easier to use and it appears to be more efficacious with a better safety profile. These findings are extrapolated from clinical trials in non-pregnant patients. In a meta-analysis of 22 randomized trials (8867 patients), subcutaneous LMWH decreased mortality (odds ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.62-0.92) and recurrent thrombosis (odds ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.55-0.84) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It was also more likely to reduce thrombus size (odds ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.59-0.81) and less likely to cause major hemorrhage (odds ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.39-0.83).</p><p>In contrast, IV UFH is preferred in patients who have a markedly elevated risk of bleeding or persistent hypotension due to pulmonary embolism (PE). This preference is based on clinical experience. The rationale is that its short half-life and near complete reversal with protamine are desirable if the anticoagulant effect needs to be stopped due to bleeding or to perform a procedure.</p><p>UFH (either IV or subcutaneous) is preferred over subcutaneous LMWH in patients who have severe renal failure. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Dosing'</a> below.)</p><p>Direct oral anticoagulants are avoided since little is known about their safety in pregnancy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Little information exists about the appropriate dosing of anticoagulants during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, additional caution seems prudent, including weight-adjusted dosing and more vigilant monitoring of anticoagulant activity. The following regimens are reasonable for the initial treatment of VTE during pregnancy or the puerperium. Regardless of the regimen, anticoagulant therapy should continue through the pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">LMWH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reasonable initial doses of subcutaneous LMWH include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dalteparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dalteparin</a> 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> once daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tinzaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tinzaparin</a> 175 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> once daily, dalteparin 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> every 12 hours, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every 12 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The dose is then titrated to an anti-Xa level of 0.6 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL</span> for twice daily administration, or 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL</span> for once daily administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>].</p><p>The first anti-Xa level is generally measured four hours after the third or fourth dose if the dosing is every 12 hours, or four hours after the second or third dose if the dosing is once daily. Most adjustments should be an increase or decrease of 10 to 25 percent. The anti-Xa level may be measured four hours after the third injection that follows a dose adjustment. Once a satisfactory anti-Xa level is reached, some clinicians recheck the level every one to three months, although this is controversial because few women require dose adjustments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">IV UFH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial dosing of IV UFH consists of an IV UFH bolus of 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg,</span> followed by a continuous infusion of 18 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> per hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The infusion is titrated every six hours to achieve a therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), defined as the aPTT that corresponds to an anti-Xa level of 0.3 to 0.7 U. The target aPTT range will be laboratory-specific. Once the target aPTT level is achieved, it should be rechecked once or twice daily. IV UFH can be transitioned to subcutaneous UFH or subcutaneous LMWH if long-term or outpatient anticoagulant therapy is planned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Subcutaneous UFH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A reasonable initial dose of subcutaneous UFH is 17,500 units every 12 hours. The dose is then titrated to achieve a therapeutic aPTT, defined as the aPTT that corresponds to an anti-Xa level of 0.3 to 0.7 U [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The target aPTT range will be laboratory-specific.</p><p>The first aPTT is generally measured six hours after the second dose. Most adjustments should be an increase or decrease of 10 to 30 percent. The aPTT may be measured six hours after the second injection that follows each dose adjustment. Once a stable dose is achieved, the aPTT may be measured after three to four days of treatment and then every few weeks. During the last 10 weeks of the pregnancy, more frequent monitoring is warranted.</p><p>Many clinicians prefer to begin with IV UFH and then transition to subcutaneous UFH in order to achieve a rapid therapeutic effect for treatment. The transition is traditionally done after the patient has received IV UFH for 5 to 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In this situation, the first aPTT can be checked six hours after the first subcutaneous UFH dose and then six hours after every dose adjustment until a stable dose that produces the desired therapeutic level is achieved. Once a stable dose of subcutaneous UFH is achieved, the aPTT may be initially checked once or twice daily for three to four days and then every few weeks. During the last 10 weeks of the pregnancy, more frequent monitoring is warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Labor and delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment with subcutaneous LMWH should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to delivery if the delivery time is predictable (eg, induction of labor, planned cesarean section). This allows the effect of heparin to resolve, which is particularly important for patients who desire neuraxial anesthesia because anticoagulation during insertion (or removal) of a neuraxial anesthesia catheter increases the risk for spinal hematoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adverse-effects-of-neuraxial-analgesia-and-anesthesia-for-obstetrics#H51358722\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adverse effects of neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia for obstetrics&quot;, section on 'Neuraxial analgesia and the anticoagulated patient'</a>.)</p><p>A period of 24 to 36 hours without anticoagulant therapy may be undesirable in pregnant women who are at high risk for recurrent VTE (eg, those with an acute PE or proximal DVT that developed within the past month). Such patients may benefit from having their subcutaneous LMWH or subcutaneous UFH switched to IV UFH, which can be discontinued 4 to 6 hours prior to delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A neuraxial catheter may be placed when the aPTT has returned to normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The clinician may be unwilling to tolerate even a short interval without anticoagulant therapy in rare circumstances, such as a patient with reduced cardiopulmonary reserve and a recent PE. A temporary inferior vena cava (IVC) filter can be inserted in this situation, or delivery can proceed despite full anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Delivery despite full anticoagulation may also occur if labor begins unexpectedly. Many patients who deliver while anticoagulated will not have excessive intrapartum bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, anticoagulated patients are at increased risk for a spinal hematoma if a neuraxial anesthesia catheter is inserted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Neuraxial anesthesia should not be administered to an anticoagulated patient.</p><p>In cases in which preterm delivery is anticipated (eg, triplets, preterm rupture of membranes, significant cervical dilation, preeclampsia, growth restriction), it is common to discontinue subcutaneous LMWH or subcutaneous UFH at 36 weeks of gestation. IV UFH is then used instead.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">After delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A heparin regimen (subcutaneous LMWH, IV UFH, or subcutaneous UFH) should be restarted 12 hours after a cesarean delivery or six hours after a vaginal birth, assuming that significant bleeding has not occurred. Options for long-term anticoagulant therapy include subcutaneous LMWH, subcutaneous UFH, or an oral vitamin K antagonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>). If warfarin therapy is chosen, the patient should receive both warfarin and heparin for at least five days. The heparin should not be stopped until the international normalized ratio (INR) has been within therapeutic range (usually 2 to 3) for two consecutive days. Warfarin is considered safe during lactation because it does not accumulate in breast milk to a substantial degree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Length of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal duration of anticoagulation is unknown and should be individualized on a case-by-case basis. However, based upon extrapolated data from the general population as well as clinical experience, the total duration of anticoagulant therapy (pregnancy plus the postpartum period) should be at least three to six months for women whose only risk factors for VTE were transient (eg, pregnancy, cesarean section) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-treatment/abstract/1,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17-19</a>].

In many cases, the heparin can be stopped and restarted after the bleeding is controlled. However, insertion of an inferior vena caval (IVC) filter should be considered if the bleeding is sufficiently severe to prohibit resumption of anticoagulant therapy.
