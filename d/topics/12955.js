The parotid gland makes saliva. It is located under the skin in front of the ear and above the jaw (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63697\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63697 \">figure 1</a>). Saliva from the parotid gland flows into the mouth through a thin tube called the &quot;parotid duct.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H200101948\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes parotitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different viruses and bacteria can cause parotitis.</p><p>Some people have a higher chance of getting parotitis. People have a higher chance of getting parotitis if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are dehydrated. This means their body has lost too much water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They just had surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They have a blockage in their parotid gland or duct. A blockage can be caused by cancer or a small hard substance called a &quot;stone&quot; that forms on its own.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They take a medicine that causes them to make less saliva.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H200101899\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of parotitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parotitis causes swelling in the parotid gland.</p><p>If the parotitis is caused by bacteria, people usually have other symptoms, too. That's because the bacteria causes the body to make pus that collects in or around the parotid gland. This can lead to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain and redness (along with the swelling) in the area around the parotid gland</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever or chills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble opening the mouth or swallowing</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H200101906\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Call your doctor or nurse if you have the symptoms listed above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H200101913\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she might also do tests, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An imaging test &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body. Your doctor might do an ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI scan.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lab tests &ndash; If you have a collection of pus, your doctor can take a sample of the pus. He or she can send it to the lab to find out what kind of bacteria is causing your infection.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H200101920\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To help your symptoms, your doctor or nurse might recommend that you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put heat on the swollen area. Wet a clean wash cloth with warm water and put it on the area. When the wash cloth cools, reheat it with warm water and put it back on. Repeat these steps for 10 to 15 minutes every few hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink lots of fluids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gently massage the swollen area.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suck on sour or lemon-flavored hard candy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take an over-the-counter medicine to treat your pain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H200101927\"><span class=\"h1\">What other treatment might I need?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other treatment depends on the germs causing the infection and how serious your infection is. Parotitis caused by a virus doesn't usually need other treatment.</p><p>Parotitis caused by bacteria is treated with antibiotic medicines. These medicines go into your vein through a tube called an &quot;IV.&quot; Once you are getting better, you might be switched to antibiotic pills.</p><p>If you have severe pain, your doctor can prescribe a strong pain medicine.</p><p>If you have a collection of pus that doesn't get better with antibiotics, your doctor might do surgery to drain the pus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H200101934\"><span class=\"h1\">Can parotitis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, in some cases. A vaccine called the &quot;MMR&quot; vaccine can help prevent parotitis. (Vaccines can prevent certain serious or deadly infections.) The MMR vaccine prevents an infection called &quot;mumps,&quot; which is a virus that can cause parotitis.</p><p>Doctors recommend that all children get the MMR vaccine as part of their routine childhood vaccines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H200102005\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-babies-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-infants-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaccines for infants and children age 0 to 6 years (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
