Skin is the most common site for the development of malignancy; in particular, cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are frequently detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-skin-cancer-in-solid-organ-transplant-recipients/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

More than 50 percent of white organ transplant recipients develop at least one cutaneous malignancy. Reduced immune surveillance, direct carcinogenic effect of immunosuppressive agents, and proliferation of oncogenic viruses in the setting of immunosuppression may contribute to the development of skin cancer. (See <a href=\"#H7860379\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7860386\" class=\"local\">'Incidence and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) account for the majority of skin cancers in organ transplant recipients. Multiple factors, including patient-specific characteristics, the intensity and duration of immunosuppression, geographic location, and sun exposure, influence the risk for the development of these lesions. In nonwhite transplant recipients, tumors are more often located in non-sun-exposed areas and are in most cases associated with human papillomavirus infection. (See <a href=\"#H7860393\" class=\"local\">'Squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Organ transplant recipients are also at increased risk of developing an invasive melanoma. The risk of death from melanoma is threefold higher in transplant recipients compared with nonrecipients. (See <a href=\"#H7860400\" class=\"local\">'Melanoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The appearance of skin cancer lesions in organ transplant recipients generally resembles lesions in immunocompetent patients, but organ transplant recipients are more likely to develop multiple tumors and aggressive tumors. SCC, BCC, melanoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma frequently develop on sun-exposed areas. The lower legs are a common site of involvement in Kaposi sarcoma. (See <a href=\"#H7860393\" class=\"local\">'Squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7860400\" class=\"local\">'Melanoma'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2293501\" class=\"local\">'Kaposi sarcoma'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7860407\" class=\"local\">'Merkel cell carcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The impact of specific immunosuppressants on the development of skin cancer is unclear. Tumor development seems to be most related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression. Compared with other immunosuppressive regimens, immunosuppression with mTOR inhibitors may reduce the risk for nonmelanoma skin cancer in organ transplant recipients. (See <a href=\"#H7860421\" class=\"local\">'Role of specific immunosuppressants'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-skin-cancer-in-solid-organ-transplant-recipients#H106013946\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of skin cancer in solid organ transplant recipients&quot;, section on 'mTOR inhibitors'</a>.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-risk-factors-for-skin-cancer-in-solid-organ-transplant-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Vajdic CM, van Leeuwen MT.
