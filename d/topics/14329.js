Parathyroidectomy is an effective therapy that cures the disease, decreases the risk of kidney stones, improves bone mineral density (BMD), and may decrease fracture risk and modestly improve some quality of life measurements. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Surgical procedure'</a> below.)</p><p>Observational studies report a marked reduction in formation of kidney stones after successful surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Furthermore, over a 10-year follow-up period, all patients with a history of nephrolithiasis who did not choose to have parathyroidectomy had progression of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, a history of nephrolithiasis is regarded as a clear indication for surgery.</p><p>Some patients may have nonspecific symptoms that are difficult to quantify. These symptoms include fatigue, a sense of weakness, mild depression, and memory impairment. Because of the largely subjective nature of these symptoms, the distinction between asymptomatic and symptomatic PHPT is not always clear-cut. Patients may deny symptoms, whereas a family member may say the patient has been mildly symptomatic in some way [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Nonspecific neuropsychiatric symptoms alone are not indications for surgery. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Neuropsychiatric'</a> below.)</p><p>If there are comorbidities, contraindications, or prior unsuccessful neck explorations that preclude surgery, or if the patient refuses surgery, preventive measures and adequate monitoring are important. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Preventive measures'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, for such patients who are unable to have surgery and whose primary indication for surgery is symptomatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe hypercalcemia, (particularly those in whom bone density is normal), we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a> rather than bisphosphonates.

In some patients with asymptomatic disease, surgery is not mandatory. Most asymptomatic patients do not have progression of disease, as defined by worsening hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, bone disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nephrolithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, some individuals do progress and would benefit from surgical cure. The primary goal is to identify the asymptomatic individuals at risk for disease progression, as well as those who have features of the disease that may improve following parathyroidectomy. These two groups of individuals would likely benefit from surgical intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19948260\"><span class=\"h2\">Candidates for surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For asymptomatic individuals who meet the Fourth International Workshop on Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism guidelines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63054\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63054 \">table 1</a>), we suggest surgical intervention as opposed to observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

The panel emphasized the need for parathyroidectomy to be performed by surgeons who are highly experienced and skilled in the operation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery versus nonsurgical management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The debate regarding treatment of asymptomatic PHPT revolves around the effect of intervention on outcomes, such as symptoms, bone disease, and biochemical abnormalities. Although parathyroidectomy improves bone density and may have modest effects on some quality-of-life symptoms, long-term, observational data and short-term, randomized trial data clearly demonstrate that a large subgroup of patients with asymptomatic PHPT can be followed safely without surgery because they do not have disease progression, as evidenced by stable biochemical abnormalities and bone mineral density (BMD) for up to a decade of observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, disease may progress (worsening hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, newly diagnosed nephrolithiasis) in as many as one-third of patients over the first years of observation, and these patients would benefit from surgical intervention. In addition, BMD declines in most patients observed for longer than 8 to 10 years. Although these observational data are based upon a small number of patients, they do suggest that long-term (&gt;8 to 10 years) observation in asymptomatic patients is not optimal for skeletal outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Subclinical bone disease'</a> below.)</p><p>The ability to identify criteria that are predictive of disease progression would improve management strategies, but these factors (other than age &lt;50 years at presentation) are as yet unknown. Proponents of surgery for asymptomatic individuals argue that many untreated patients are lost to follow-up after 5 to 10 years and that the cost of follow-up visits and tests may ultimately exceed the costs of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Some argue that parathyroidectomy is an attractive strategy for nearly all patients, particularly with recent significant progress in techniques for minimally invasive surgical extirpation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Proponents who favor nonoperative management for asymptomatic individuals cite the lack of disease progression in the majority of patients and the ability to treat, if necessary, with alternative therapies as reasons to avoid an invasive procedure. (See <a href=\"#H19948915\" class=\"local\">'Poor surgical candidates'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h4\">Neuropsychiatric</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although only a minority of patients with mild PHPT have the classic symptoms of the disease (nephrolithiasis or overt bone disease, osteitis fibrosa cystica), many have nonspecific symptoms. These symptoms include fatigue, a sense of weakness, mild depression, and memory impairment; their reversal after surgery in some patients suggests that they were caused by the hypercalcemia or the hypersecretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/15-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-24</a>]. However, most of the studies reporting symptomatic improvement were observational and were limited by selection bias, inclusion of subjects with symptomatic hyperparathyroidism, or by lack of an adequate control group or validated instruments to describe neuropsychiatric symptoms.</p><p>Long-term, randomized, controlled trials are necessary to determine the benefits of surgery in reducing nonspecific symptoms. However, randomized trials also have limitations, including difficulty recruiting asymptomatic patients who will accept randomization to surgery. Subjects who choose to participate may well differ from those who decline enrollment, decreasing the generalizability of the results to all patients with asymptomatic PHPT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, withdrawal rates are high due to a variety of reasons, including discontent with initial treatment assignment. Despite these limitations, the results of randomized trials assessing the benefit of surgery versus observation on neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals with asymptomatic PHPT provide important information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one trial, 53 of 283 potentially eligible patients (calcium between 10.1 and 11.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [2.52 to 2.87 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> agreed to be randomly assigned to surgery or observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/26,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29</a>]. At baseline, mean Short Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey scores were similar to published normals. Those who underwent successful surgery (traditional neck exploration) had little change in psychosocial functioning two years later, but there was a significant decline over time in the observation group. After a median follow-up of 42 months, there was a significant benefit of surgery compared with no surgery in two of nine domains of the SF-36 survey (social functioning and emotional problems) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another trial, 191 patients (mean calcium 10.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [2.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> were randomly assigned to medical observation or surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. At baseline, all patients had lower scores in the psychological and mental component domains of the SF-36 and Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale, respectively, compared with an age and gender-matched database. In an interim analysis after two years of follow-up (99 subjects), there were no clinically significant improvements in either group. There were small differences in the physical and emotional domains over two years, favoring surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a one-year trial of 50 patients (mean calcium 10.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [2.55 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> randomly assigned to observation or parathyroidectomy, there was modest improvement in some SF-36 quality-of-life domains (bodily pain, general health, vitality, and mental health) in patients assigned to surgery compared with observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p>Taken together, current randomized trial data suggest minimal to modest differences in some domains of the SF-36, favoring surgical intervention. The fact that improvements were noted in differing domains of the SF-36 in the different trials suggests that individual patients cannot have specific expectations regarding surgical outcome for neuropsychiatric symptoms. In addition, the differences were very small and of uncertain clinical significance. Continued follow-up and additional studies are warranted to determine whether these benefits outweigh surgical risks. It should be noted that while current international guidelines do not include neuropsychiatric symptoms as a specific indication for parathyroidectomy, more liberal guidelines have recently been issued by the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These guidelines suggest intervention for neurocognitive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neuropsychiatric symptoms that &quot;are attributable to PHPT,&quot; although the evidence supporting this recommendation is of low quality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">Subclinical renal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important subclinical renal manifestations of PHPT include asymptomatic nephrolithiasis, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and chronic renal insufficiency (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations#H937364\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Clinical manifestations&quot;, section on 'Subclinical renal disease'</a>). Patients with subclinical renal disease are regarded as having symptomatic disease and are candidates for surgery, regardless of the absence of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Most stones in patients with hyperparathyroidism are composed of calcium oxalate. A contributing factor for stone formation in hyperparathyroidism is hypercalciuria. However, urinary calcium excretion per gram creatinine does not necessarily differentiate patients with or without stones, nor does it predict the development of kidney stones in an individual patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Nevertheless, most experts believe that urinary calcium excretion &gt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> raises sufficient enough concern about long-term renal complications to warrant a recommendation for parathyroidectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Clinical manifestations&quot;, section on 'Nephrolithiasis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Cardiovascular</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiovascular features of classical PHPT include hypertension, arrhythmia, ventricular hypertrophy, and vascular and valvular calcification. In addition, several studies in Europe have reported increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with otherwise asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism.

In a two-year analysis of a randomized trial of parathyroidectomy versus observation in 116 patients with asymptomatic PHPT, mean arterial and diastolic blood pressure declined in both groups with no significant difference between groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. There were also no differences between the two groups in cardiovascular risk factors, including lipids, adiponectin, leptin, C-reactive protein, or biochemical markers of endothelial function (eg, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, Von Willebrand factor). There were only minor differences in echocardiogram findings in 49 patients in whom echocardiography was performed (a significant reduction in diastolic dimension of the interventricular septum and a nonsignificant reduction in left ventricular mass, both in the parathyroidectomy group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Current research is focusing on more subtle abnormalities of the cardiovascular system. The nature of such involvement and the extent to which any abnormalities improve postoperatively need to be elucidated before recommending surgery based upon such considerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Subclinical bone disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism may have decreased BMD, in particular at more cortical sites (forearm and hip) as compared with more trabecular sites (spine). In addition, observations from large case-control and cohort studies suggest that there may be increased fracture risk at vertebral and other skeletal sites. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Clinical manifestations&quot;, section on 'Bone mineral density'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Clinical manifestations&quot;, section on 'Fractures'</a>.)</p><p>Randomized trials have demonstrated increased BMD following parathyroidectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/27-29,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29,38</a>]. In one trial, lumbar spine BMD increased in the surgical group compared with the medical observation group two years after surgery; spine BMD remained unchanged in the medical group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A similar but nonsignificant trend was noted at the femoral neck. In another randomized trial, BMD after two years was slightly better at the femoral neck and total hip (but not spine) in the surgical compared with the nonsurgical group (group differences of 0.8 and 1.0 percent per year at the femoral neck and hip, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Significant improvement in BMD postparathyroidectomy has also been noted in observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/2,40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,40-43</a>]. In one prospective study of a cohort of 121 patients with hyperparathyroidism followed for up to 10 years, there were substantial increments in BMD of 12 to 15 percent in those who underwent parathyroidectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Most of the increments occurred within the first year at the lumbar spine and within the first two years at the hip.</p><p>In most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/2,41,42,44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,41,42,44-46</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>], studies, the initial years of observation without surgical intervention were not associated with progressive bone loss. In a 15-year follow-up of the prospective cohort study described above, lumbar spine BMD remained stable in the six patients observed without intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In contrast, BMD started to fall at cortical sites, ultimately decreasing at the femoral neck and distal radius by 10 and 35 percent, respectively. Although the sample size after 10 years was limited, these data suggest that nonsurgical management of PHPT is not a lifelong strategy and requires careful reevaluation in stable patients after ten years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/14,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,49</a>].</p><p>Observational data suggest that fracture risk is decreased after parathyroidectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/34,50-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,50-54</a>]. A prospective randomized study also suggested a decline in vertebral fractures following parathyroidectomy (as compared with observation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>There are no trials directly comparing parathyroidectomy with medical therapy (eg, bisphosphonates) for the treatment of low BMD. In the short term, bisphosphonates improve bone density in patients with PHPT. However, documentation that the bone density benefit is sustained and accompanied by fracture reduction is lacking (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Bisphosphonates'</a> below). PHPT is a chronic disease, and patients with PHPT and osteoporosis require a long-term solution. There is concern about the adverse effects of long-term use of bisphosphonates. For these reasons, surgery remains the treatment of choice for osteoporotic patients with PHPT.

Bilateral exploration relies on visual and weight-based estimations of gland size to distinguish a single adenoma from multiglandular disease. However, with increased experience, improved imaging modalities, and the use of adjuncts such as intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring (IOPTH), minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) is emerging as the procedure of choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The success of a targeted parathyroidectomy is dependent upon preoperative localization studies that permit the surgeon to limit the operative field to the region where a single radiologic focus is identified.

However, urinary calcium excretion rose to exceed &gt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours in three patients, and in one patient, serum calcium increased from 10.5 to 11.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.6 to 3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial of 2800 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day</span> of cholecalciferol versus placebo in 46 patients with PHPT and hypovitaminosis D (mean 25[OH]D 21.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [54 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L]),</span> vitamin D supplementation raised the serum 25(OH)D to 37 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> while reducing parathyroid hormone (PTH) by 17 percent and improving lumbar spine BMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. There was no difference between groups in serum or urinary calcium levels.</p><p/><p>Regardless of the vitamin D dose, particular caution must be exercised in those individuals with vitamin D deficiency whose urinary calcium excretion is in the upper range of normal or frankly elevated. Once these individuals are vitamin D replete, their urinary calcium levels can rise quickly, increasing their risk for kidney stone formation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment#H23545822\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D deficiency in adults: Definition, clinical manifestations, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Coexisting primary hyperparathyroidism'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1445705\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMOCALCEMIC HYPERPARATHYROIDISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism (elevated parathyroid hormone [PTH], normal serum calcium) typically come to medical attention in the setting of an evaluation for low bone mineral density (BMD). In order to make this diagnosis, certain conditions must be met. In particular, all secondary causes for hyperparathyroidism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73157\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73157 \">table 2</a>) must be ruled out, and ionized calcium levels should be normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-diagnosis-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism versus secondary hyperparathyroidism'</a>.)</p><p>There are currently insufficient longitudinal data on patients with this newer phenotype of PHPT to support definite guidelines for management. In practice, however, most patients with symptomatic (ie, kidney stones, overt skeletal involvement) normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism should undergo parathyroid surgery, as is recommended for patients with symptomatic PHPT. Patients with asymptomatic normocalcemic PHPT may develop symptomatic disease and, therefore, require monitoring for disease progression and development of indications for surgery (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above). Again, in the absence of sufficient data to support accepted surgical criteria, experts generally consider surgery when one or more of the current guidelines used in asymptomatic PHPT is met (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63054\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63054 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>For such patients who meet surgical criteria, we routinely obtain a localization study with ultrasonography, technetium-99m sestamibi, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to facilitate unilateral exploration or minimally invasive surgery. As is true for patients with PHPT, patients with normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism and negative preoperative localization studies require bilateral exploration by an experienced parathyroid surgeon (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-localization-for-parathyroid-surgery-in-patients-with-primary-hyperparathyroidism#H709617\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative localization for parathyroid surgery in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism&quot;, section on 'Negative imaging'</a>). If osteoporosis is the only indication for surgery, some physicians treat patients who have negative localization studies with a bisphosphonate rather than surgery.</p><p>In one prospective study of 37 patients with normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism, 41 percent developed evidence for progressive hyperparathyroid disease during a median of three years (range one to eight years) of observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. However, less than 20 percent of patients became hypercalcemic during the observation period. Instead, some persistently normocalcemic patients developed other indications of progressive disease, such as kidney stones, hypercalciuria, bone loss, and fracture. Furthermore, four individuals with normal serum calcium levels had successful parathyroid surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3166240\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PHPT is uncommon during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/96-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">96-99</a>]. However, moderate to severe hypercalcemia during pregnancy may carry significant maternal and fetal risks. In case reports and case series, maternal presentation included hyperemesis, nephrolithiasis, recurrent urinary tract infection, and pancreatitis. Neonatal complications included hypocalcemia and tetany, secondary to fetal parathyroid hormone (PTH) suppression, preterm delivery, low birth weight, and fetal demise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/97,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,100</a>]. These outcomes are very uncommon in pregnancies of patients with mild hypercalcemia.</p><p>As in nonpregnant patients, treatment is based upon severity and symptoms, but consideration of gestational age is also important. When interpreting the severity of serum calcium elevations in pregnant women, it is important to remember that total serum calcium declines across gestation, likely due to plasma volume expansion. The upper limit of normal for total serum calcium is 9.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in pregnancy. The active, ionized calcium level does not change significantly during a normal pregnancy.</p><p>Surgery during the second trimester is the preferred treatment for symptomatic patients; however, observation may be appropriate in some circumstances (for some patients with asymptomatic, very mild hypercalcemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. In one small series, surgery was successfully performed in 15 of 16 patients during the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-management/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. In pregnant patients undergoing minimally invasive parathyroid surgery (MIP), localization is done with ultrasound rather than sestamibi. If a woman with diagnosed PHPT plans a pregnancy, parathyroidectomy should be done prior to conception. If a patient is followed through her pregnancy with very mild hypercalcemia, it is important to alert neonatologists to the possibility of hypocalcemia in the newborn (due to possible suppression of the fetal parathyroid gland).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H935876580\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Parathyroidectomy is an effective therapy that cures the disease, decreases the risk of kidney stones, improves bone mineral density (BMD), and may decrease fracture risk and modestly improve some quality-of-life measurements. (See <a href=\"#H3165101\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The widespread identification of individuals with asymptomatic PHPT raises the question of if and when these individuals should undergo surgery. Surgical guidelines for PHPT have been developed based upon risk for end-organ effects and for disease progression. Parathyroidectomy should be performed only by surgeons who are highly experienced and skilled in the operation. (See <a href=\"#H3165107\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For asymptomatic individuals who meet the Fourth International Workshop on Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism guidelines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63054\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63054 \">table 1</a>), we suggest surgical intervention as opposed to observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

If disease progression occurs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63054\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63054 \">table 1</a>), we would proceed to surgery, as described above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, patients with asymptomatic PHPT who do not meet surgical intervention criteria may still choose parathyroidectomy because it is the only definitive therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are unable to have surgery and whose primary indication for surgery is symptomatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe hypercalcemia or osteoporosis and high risk for fracture, we recommend medical therapy rather than observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). If there is no need to improve bone density or to lower the serum calcium, we do not use pharmacologic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H19948915\" class=\"local\">'Poor surgical candidates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For such patients who are unable to have surgery and whose primary indication for surgery is symptomatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe hypercalcemia (particularly those in whom bone density is normal), we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a> rather than bisphosphonates (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
