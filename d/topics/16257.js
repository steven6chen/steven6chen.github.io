It usually gets better on its own. But sore throat can sometimes be serious.</p><p>Call your child's doctor or nurse if your child has a sore throat and:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a fever of at least 101&deg;F or 38.4&deg;C</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doesn't want to eat or drink anything</p><p/><p><strong>Call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong> or take your child to the emergency room if your child:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has trouble breathing or swallowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is drooling much more than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a stiff or swollen neck</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3295398\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes sore throat?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sore throat is usually caused by an infection. Two types of germs can cause the infection: viruses and bacteria. Children spread germs easily because they often touch each other, share toys, and put things in their mouths.</p><p>Children who have a sore throat caused by a virus do not usually need to see a doctor or nurse. Children who have a sore throat caused by bacteria might need to see a doctor or nurse. They might have a type of infection called strep throat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3295355\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I tell if my child's sore throat is caused by a virus or strep throat?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is hard to tell the difference. But there are some clues to look for (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F78761\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78761 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>People who have a sore throat caused by a virus usually have other symptoms, too. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A runny nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A stuffed-up chest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itchy or red eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A raspy (hoarse) voice</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the roof of the mouth</p><p/><p>People who have strep throat <strong>do not</strong> usually have a cough, runny nose, or itchy or red eyes.</p><p>If you think your child might have strep throat, call your child's doctor. He or she can do a test to check for the bacteria that cause strep throat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3295363\"><span class=\"h1\">Does my child need antibiotics?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the sore throat is caused by a virus, your child <strong>does not</strong> need antibiotics. Unless your child has strep throat, antibiotics will <strong>not</strong> help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3295370\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to help my child feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several ways to help relieve a sore throat:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Soothing foods and drinks</strong> &ndash; Give your child things that are easy to swallow, like tea or soup, or popsicles to suck on. Your child might not feel like eating or drinking, but it's important that he or she gets enough liquids. Offer different warm and cold drinks for your child to try.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medicines</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) can help with throat pain. The correct dose depends on your child's weight, so ask your child's doctor how much to give.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Do not give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> or medicines that contain aspirin to children younger than 18 years. In children, aspirin can cause a serious problem called Reye syndrome. Do not give children throat sprays or cough drops, either. Throat sprays and cough drops contain medicine, but they are no better at relieving throat pain than hard candies. Plus, in some cases they can cause an allergic reaction or other side effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other treatments</strong> &ndash; For children who are older than 4 to 5 years, sucking on hard candies or a lollipop might help. For children older than 6 to 8 years, gargling with warm salt water might help.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3295377\"><span class=\"h1\">When can my child go back to school?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child's sore throat is caused by a virus, he or she should be able to go back to school as soon as he or she feels better. If your child has a fever, he or she should stay home for at least 24 hours after the fever has gone away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3295384\"><span class=\"h1\">How can I keep my child from getting a sore throat again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wash your child's hands often with soap and water. It is one of the best ways to prevent the spread of infection. You can use an alcohol rub instead, but make sure the hand rub gets everywhere on your child's hands.</p><p>Try to teach your child about other ways to avoid spreading germs, such as not touching his or her face after being around a sick person.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3295458\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=strep-throat-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Strep throat in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-runny-nose-and-the-common-cold-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough, runny nose, and the common cold (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=giving-your-child-over-the-counter-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Giving your child over-the-counter medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sore-throat-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sore throat in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: The common cold in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
