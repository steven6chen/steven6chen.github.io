Like acute compartment syndrome (ACS), it is thought to result from increased pressure within a muscle compartment. CECS occurs primarily in the lower leg, although it has been reported in the forearm and elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The presentation, diagnosis, and management of CECS are reviewed here. ACS and running injuries are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of running injuries of the lower extremity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3298170779\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ACS occurs when increased intramuscular pressure (ie, hydrostatic pressure within the interstitial space of a skeletal muscle) impedes local tissue perfusion, leading to pain, paresthesias, and ultimately, compromised muscle function in the affected limb(s) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Most cases of ACS are caused by trauma. CECS is a reversible form of ACS triggered by physical activity. Symptoms typically resolve quickly once exercise is terminated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H31749669\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p>The pathophysiology of CECS is not completely understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The prevailing theory is that tissue ischemia in CECS stems from a noncompliant fascial compartment that cannot accommodate the expansion of muscle volume that occurs with exercise. Simply put, &quot;stiff&quot; muscle tissue does not allow for the increased blood flow that exercising muscle requires. As pressure increases and local tissue perfusion becomes compromised, metabolic demands cannot be met and ischemic symptoms develop. Several studies have demonstrated decreased blood flow and oxygenation in the legs of symptomatic patients with CECS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].</p><p>Exercise substantially increases blood flow to active muscles, causing their volume to expand by as much as 20 percent. Lower extremity intramuscular pressure can exceed 500 mmHg during contractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Perfusion of peripheral muscle occurs when the muscle is relaxed and the arterial-venous gradient is relatively high. The gradient must be at least 30 mmHg to overcome intramuscular resting pressure; if the gradient falls below this threshold, perfusion is compromised. A definitive diagnosis of CECS requires the measurement of elevated compartment pressures. (See <a href=\"#H502554\" class=\"local\">'Compartment pressure measurement'</a> below.)</p><p>If significant tissue damage is sustained from prolonged or severe ischemia, the subsequent inflammatory cascade and swelling may prevent the typical normalization of pressures and resolution of symptoms that are expected from rest. In this way, CECS may rarely become an escalating syndrome that more closely resembles acute or traumatic compartment syndrome. This surgical emergency is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the pathologic effects described above, compromised perfusion and the resulting deoxygenation of muscle causes increased cell permeability, leading to a shift of fluid into the interstitial space. The fluid extravasation and potential metabolite accumulation may contribute to neural compression, exacerbating the pain experienced during activity, and may cause irreversible damage if left untreated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Some researchers postulate differences in the pathophysiology of younger versus older patients with CECS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Higher rates of bilateral symptoms and of successful surgical treatment among high school and college-age patients compared to those over age 23 have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Younger patients have thicker fascia with increased stiffness, which may contribute to better postoperative results. Conversely, older patients are more likely to have developed chronic changes in musculoskeletal and neurovascular structures that may contribute to recalcitrant symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31749655\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The true prevalence of CECS in the general population is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. It is likely that many people suffering from early symptoms of CECS decrease or modify their activity level to manage their condition and never seek medical attention. In addition, CECS is likely under-diagnosed by the coaches, athletic trainers, and primary care physicians to whom symptoms are first presented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The gold standard for diagnosis requires invasive pressure measurements in the affected muscle compartment, something rarely done in training rooms or primary care clinics. (See <a href=\"#H502554\" class=\"local\">'Compartment pressure measurement'</a> below.)</p><p>Observational studies provide some sense of the prevalence of CECS among certain populations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study of active Unites States military personnel reported 4100 cases of CECS between 2006 and 2011, for an incidence rate of 0.49 cases per 1000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Age was the most significant risk factor, with the adjusted incidence ratio for personnel over 40 years almost nine times that of personnel under 20 years (IRR 8.77; 95% CI 7.31-10.52).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective review of 226 patients (393 leg compartment pressure tests), of whom 153 were diagnosed with CECS, reported that 67 percent of the patients who gave a history consistent with the diagnosis were found to have elevated intramuscular pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 108 patients with lower leg pain of unknown cause, elevated intracompartmental pressures were found in 15 patients (13.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In retrospective observational studies of patients with suspected CECS referred to specialty clinics and diagnosed by compartment pressure measurement, the reported incidence ranged from 28 percent in a study of 80 patients to 82 percent in a study of 276 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/17,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21,22</a>].</p><p/><p>Most published reports of CECS describe the diagnosis in athletes, particularly runners, with vigorous training regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. In one of the largest retrospective studies of CECS in a non-military population, 92.2 percent of affected individuals reported participation in sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The most common individual sport was running, while the most common team sports were soccer, lacrosse, and field hockey. Competitive athletes (63.1 percent) were more likely to have the condition compared to recreational athletes. These findings are consistent with another retrospective study of patients with CECS, which found the most common sports associated with the condition to be running (25 percent), soccer (23 percent), and field hockey (12 percent), while 50 percent of patients were multisport athletes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>CECS generally occurs in the leg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], most often in the anterior compartment, followed in decreasing order of occurrence by the lateral, deep posterior, and superficial posterior compartments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/17,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,24-26</a>]. However, cases of CECS have been described in non-athletes and compartments of the foot, thigh, forearm, and hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/27-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-33</a>]. CECS involving the upper extremity is rare, but may occur in participants of motocross or rowing. More rarely, CECS of the forearm has been reported in other forearm dominant sports, such as weight lifting, pitching, kayaking, and swimming [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>].</p><p>Early studies of CECS were dominated by adult male patients and a large proportion of military recruits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/23,25,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25,38,39</a>]. Studies involving older adults (mean age 26.6 years) suggest the condition occurs more frequently in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, the condition occurs in both males and females, and studies of younger athletes suggest a female predominance. In one retrospective series of 155 patients treated surgically for CECS (mean age 16.4), 88 percent were female [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], while another series involving 153 confirmed cases (mean age 24), reported that 60 percent were female [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>It is difficult to draw conclusions about factors that contribute to CECS because the condition is often misdiagnosed initially and there may be a delay of months or even years between the onset of symptoms and definitive diagnosis. In one series, patients suffered symptoms for an average of 28 months (range 1 to 144 months) before diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Anecdotal evidence suggests that sudden increases in training volume may contribute, but such claims are susceptible to recall bias. Body mass index (BMI) does not seem to be a predictive factor. In one review, the average BMI was 25 and no difference was noted between patients whose muscle compartment pressures were sufficiently elevated to be diagnosed as CECS and those that were not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31749669\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical patient with CECS is a young athlete, often a runner, who describes gradually increasing pain in a specific muscle region (usually the lower leg) during physical exertion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59437\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59437 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68629 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/5,16,17,19,20,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16,17,19,20,40,41</a>]. The pain may be described as aching, squeezing, cramping, or tightness. Patients with CECS are typically asymptomatic at rest and during activities of daily living.</p><p>Reproducibility is among the most distinctive clinical characteristics of CECS. Pain typically begins within several minutes of starting the inciting activity, often at a specific point in training that patients recognize. As an example, runners often can describe the time or distance required for symptoms to develop. Pain steadily increases with continued exertion, but resolves completely with rest, although not immediately upon stopping exercise. Complete resolution of symptoms occurs shortly (typically 10 to 20 minutes) after activity is stopped and is so characteristic that the diagnosis should be reconsidered if such a correlation cannot be established. In addition, the same symptoms typically recur despite extended periods of rest once the athlete begins to run or exercise again.</p><p>Of note, while not common, acute-on-chronic compartment syndrome can develop, in which case pain does <strong>not</strong> resolve with rest. ACS is a limb-threatening emergency and immediate evaluation is required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Neurologic symptoms such as paresthesias, numbness, and foot-drop can occur in patients with CECS. According to one large case series, 36 percent of patients with CECS associated with pain at the anterior <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lateral leg develop numbness in the distribution of the superficial peroneal nerve (dorsum of the foot) after the onset of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The structures found in the muscle compartments of the upper and lower extremities, and the most common symptoms and signs associated with elevated pressures within these compartments, are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Anatomic compartments and related clinical signs'</a>.)</p><p>In a study of 80 patients referred to a clinic for suspected CECS, researchers reported that compartment syndrome of the lower leg is more likely if [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain is induced only by athletic activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain is limited to the anterior leg compartment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain forces the athlete to stop running.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tenderness is present nowhere else in the leg but the involved compartment.</p><p/><p>The physical examination of patients suffering from CECS is often unremarkable at rest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/5,16,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16,42</a>]. It can be helpful to examine the patient after they exercise to the point of eliciting symptoms. Following such activity, the involved compartment may be tense or tender. Relative weakness of muscles in the involved compartment may be noted when compared with a pre-exercise evaluation.</p><p>Muscle hernias and palpable fascial defects may be present in patients with CECS, although, these are frequently seen in patients with other causes of lower leg pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/21,22,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22,40</a>]. According to observational studies, muscle hernias occur in 20 to 60 percent of patients, although the true incidence is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/5,11,20-22,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11,20-22,43</a>]. Most often the hernias themselves are asymptomatic and so may not prompt the patient to seek evaluation. However, while not themselves diagnostic, bilateral muscle hernias, particularly those that become more prominent during exercise, may be a helpful clue to the diagnosis. Fascial defects have been found in 15 to 50 percent of patients undergoing surgery for CECS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Bulky, well-developed calf or anterior tibialis muscles may be noted in patients with CECS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/5,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,20</a>]. Abnormal distal pulses are uncommon and should lead the clinician to reconsider the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/16,20,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20,42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-arterial-pulse#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the arterial pulse&quot;, section on 'Unequal or delayed pulses'</a>.)</p><p>Although CECS may occur in any location with a compartment, 95 percent of cases involve the lower extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/1,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11</a>]. CECS involving the forearm has been described, primarily in motorcycle and motocross racers and in weightlifters but is much less common. Achiness, tightness, cramping, and weakness of the wrist flexors or extensors are among the reported findings. In one large review of upper extremity CECS, approximately 28 percent of patients had bilateral symptoms. Of note, the authors of the review state that different thresholds for elevated pressure in forearm compartments may be needed for accurate diagnosis. They found that a large proportion of patients (23 percent) whose pressures would not be considered elevated using standard criteria nevertheless improved significantly with surgical release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H504249\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING AND OTHER NONINVASIVE DIAGNOSTIC TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Researchers continue to investigate a number of non-invasive methods for diagnosing CECS in order to avoid the need for direct, invasive intramuscular pressure measurements. Prospective techniques include: <sup>31</sup>P-NMR spectroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>], MIBI perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], magnetic resonance imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>], near-infrared spectroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a> single photon emission tomography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Some clinicians use ultrasound to measure muscle compartment diameters before and after an exercise challenge to aid diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Nevertheless, no noninvasive measurement technique has been accepted as an equivalent alternative to direct pressure measurement. Therefore, imaging should be considered only as a means of ruling out other potential etiologies. Bone scan and MRI may be used to look for stress fracture, stress reaction, or periostitis. Ultrasound or MRI may be used to assess for nerve or arterial entrapment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H502554\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPARTMENT PRESSURE MEASUREMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the history and physical examination suggest the diagnosis of CECS, a definitive diagnosis is made by measuring compartment pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/17,21,45,55-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21,45,55-61</a>]. Although, some researchers believe the history and physical examination alone may be sufficient to make the diagnosis in some instances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/38,62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,62,63</a>], most clinicians, including the authors, believe compartment pressure measurements are necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/5,6,40,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,40,64</a>]. In most cases where we believe CECS to be the most likely diagnosis, we try conservative measures to alleviate symptoms and complete our work-up of other possible causes, before measuring compartment pressures. (See <a href=\"#H3905387471\" class=\"local\">'Approach and nonsurgical treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>There is little high-quality evidence and no agreed upon standard for diagnosing CECS on the basis of compartment pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/57,58,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58,65</a>]. Measurement techniques, the timing of the measurements in relation to exercise, and the criteria used to diagnosis CECS vary among clinicians. Furthermore, measurements may differ among clinics depending upon the type of catheter used and whether the patient can reproduce the pain caused by exercising at the time measurements are taken. Therefore, to improve accuracy, compartment pressures should be measured by clinicians with experience performing the procedure using standardized equipment and techniques (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F113699\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113699 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>Of note, some authors caution against blind, transcutaneous measurements of the deep posterior compartment of the lower leg given the potential for neurovascular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Some clinicians use ultrasound to help with needle placement when measuring the deep posterior compartment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].</p><p>The most widely used diagnostic criteria for CECS, which we use in our clinics, are those proposed by Pedowitz et al [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/5,21,68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,21,68-70</a>]. (Note that these criteria were developed for CECS of the leg. No widely agreed upon criteria to diagnose CECS of the upper extremity have been developed.) According to these criteria, CECS of the leg is present if one or more of the following intramuscular pressure criteria are met:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preexercise pressure &ge;15 mmHg</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1 minute postexercise pressure of &ge;30 mmHg</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5 minute postexercise pressure &ge;20 mmHg</p><p/><p>A systematic review of studies that assessed methods for measuring compartment pressure in CECS noted that in the six studies that included a 1 minute postexercise compartment pressure measurement, there was no overlap in the mean pressures obtained in patients (34 to 55.4 mmHg) and controls (9 to 19 mmHg) at that time, suggesting that 1 minute is a useful interval when obtaining pressures to diagnose CECS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>The measurement of intramuscular pressures <strong>during</strong> exercise (dynamic measurement) has been limited by technical difficulties, but studies of this approach continue. In a small, preliminary study, researchers reported that direct measurements obtained during maximal patient discomfort while they were exercising on a treadmill accurately predicted CECS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Further investigation of these techniques is needed.</p><p>Direct intramuscular pressure measurement is an invasive procedure. Alternative, noninvasive means of accurately measuring muscle compartment pressures are the subject of ongoing research. These are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Investigational techniques'</a>.)</p><p>Rates of elevated pressures vary among leg compartments, and more than one compartment may be affected. In a retrospective review involving 226 patients and 153 confirmed cases of CECS, the anterior compartment was elevated in 42 percent, the lateral compartment in 35.5 percent, the deep posterior in 19 percent, and the superficial posterior in 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Pedowitz criteria were used to make the diagnosis. In 39.6 percent of cases, two compartments were affected (typically the anterior and lateral), but 37 percent of cases involved a single compartment. Three compartments were affected in 17.6 percent of patients, while only 4.8 percent involved all four compartments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82888729\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of CECS is made by measuring compartment pressures and finding them to be elevated in a patient whose history and physical examination suggest the diagnosis. A presumptive diagnosis may be made on the basis of the clinical presentation alone. The typical presentation for CECS is a young athlete, often a runner, who describes gradually increasing pain in a specific muscle region (usually the lower leg) during physical exertion. Pain generally begins within several minutes of starting the inciting activity and resolves completely with rest, although not immediately upon stopping exercise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82888071\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for CECS primarily includes other causes of leg pain. Common alternative diagnoses to rule out in athletes include medial tibial stress syndrome, stress fracture, and tendinopathy, and deep vein thrombosis is an important consideration. The history and physical examination often distinguish alternative diagnoses from CECS.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medial tibial stress syndrome (ie, shin splints) &#8210; The pain associated with CECS is brought on by and occurs during exertion, and is relieved quickly by rest, typically within 10 to 20 minutes. In contrast, the pain associated with medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) does not develop until a day or a few days after the inciting activity, and once present is typically exacerbated by activities of daily living and often only partially relieved by rest. Complete resolution of symptoms typically requires days or weeks of rest from exercise. On examination, MTSS typically produces focal tenderness along the posteromedial tibial periosteum of patients, but leg compartments are not tense; CECS does not cause focal bony tenderness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity#H24287212\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of running injuries of the lower extremity&quot;, section on 'Medial tibial stress syndrome (shin splints) and tibial stress fractures'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress fracture of the tibia or fibula &#8210; If an athlete continues to exercise, the pain from stress fractures increases gradually over days to weeks, is often exacerbated by daily activities, and causes focal tenderness over the involved portion of the tibia or fibula. Pain begins with weight bearing and worsens with activity. In contrast, pain due to CECS does not develop until the patient has engaged in the inciting activity (typically running) for several minutes. Although plain radiographs obtained early in the development of a stress fracture may be negative, advanced imaging studies or plain radiographs repeated weeks later reveal the fracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-fractures-of-the-tibia-and-fibula\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress fractures of the tibia and fibula&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tendinopathy &#8210; In contrast to CECS, the pain from tendinopathy is chronic, typically has increased over weeks, and is brought on immediately with activity involving the affected muscle group. Tendinopathy usually causes focal tenderness of the involved tendon, and strength or mobility testing of the specific muscle group elicits focal pain. Muscle compartments are not tense. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-overuse-chronic-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of overuse (chronic) tendinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep vein thrombosis &#8210; Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) typically presents with gradually worsening pain and swelling in the posterior calf. Pain is unrelated to any specific activity, swelling is generalized, and there is no focal tenderness. The patient may have risk factors for venous thrombosis (eg, recent trauma or surgery, history of prior DVT or cancer, coagulopathy, pregnancy). DVT is potentially life-threatening, and an appropriate workup must be performed if the diagnosis is suspected.

Surgical release of the involved compartments is considered standard treatment of moderate to severe cases of CECS, and cases that do not improve with conservative care in patients who wish to continue engaging in activities that elicit symptoms. Ideally, the surgeon should have experience managing CECS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-extremity-fasciotomy-techniques#H428235599\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower extremity fasciotomy techniques&quot;, section on 'Alternative fasciotomy techniques for elective compartment decompression'</a>.)</p><p>While controlled trials are lacking, according to available studies, surgical management of CECS using either fasciotomy or fasciectomy appears to yield good results in most cases, although success rates vary by study, subpopulation, and location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/26,70,84-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,70,84-89</a>]. Success is defined as resolution of symptoms and successful return to full activity. Short- and medium-term follow-up data from multiple observational studies suggest that approximately 70 to 80 percent of patients return to full activity following surgical release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/14,26,69,85,86,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,26,69,85,86,88</a>], which is consistent with our experience.</p><p>Additional important points about surgical management of CECS include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For reasons that remain unclear, surgical success rates appear to be lower among military personnel and females.

In a retrospective study of 155 pediatric patients (mean age 16.4), 79.5 percent returned to sport after surgical release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Of note, in this cohort 18.8 percent required a second operation. In contrast, a retrospective study of 611 active United States military personnel diagnosed with CECS reported that a substantial percentage experienced recurrence (44.7 percent) or failed to return to full duty (27.7 percent) following surgical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Although this study did not provide a clear description of how CECS was defined or diagnosed and is limited by its retrospective design, its results are consistent with several other observational studies that reported a lower percentage of military recruits able to return to full activity following fasciotomy compared to civilian populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,92</a>]. The reasons for this difference remain unclear, but the finding suggests that a cautious approach to surgical intervention is prudent when caring for military personnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Surgical success rates may be lower in female athletes, again, for reasons that remain unclear. One review of females treated surgically for CECS reported a success rate of 76 percent and the authors noted that other published studies confirm higher failure rates among women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].

Open fasciotomy of the anterior compartment is successful in over 80 percent of cases, according to observational studies, while the success rate for the deep posterior compartment is consistently lower (30 to 65 percent in most studies), leading some researchers to conclude that the inclusion of the deep posterior compartment may negatively bias the results of large studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. A systematic review of seven studies of surgical treatments for CECS involving the deep posterior compartment, including superficial crural fasciotomy and multiple fasciotomies, emphasized the absence of controlled trials, variability in diagnostic criteria, relatively poor success rates, and the absence of known risk factors for surgical failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-exertional-compartment-syndrome/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].

CECS typically affects young endurance athletes, particularly distance runners. Military recruits and personnel appear to be at increased risk. Sudden increases in training volume may increase risk. (See <a href=\"#H31749655\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3298170779\" class=\"local\">'Definition and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The typical patient with CECS is a young athlete, often a runner, who describes gradually increasing pain in a specific muscle region (usually the lower leg) during physical exertion. Pain develops shortly after the start of exercise and resolves soon (typically within 10 to 20 minutes) after the activity stops. The reproducibility of symptoms is a distinctive characteristic of CECS. Runners often can describe the time or distance required for symptoms to develop. The pain may be described as aching, squeezing, cramping, or tightness. Patients with CECS are typically asymptomatic at rest and during activities of daily living. (See <a href=\"#H31749669\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination is often unremarkable at rest, and the condition is often misdiagnosed initially. Examining the patient after they exercise to the point of provoking symptoms may allow the clinician to detect tenderness or tenseness in the involved compartment. Relative weakness of muscles in the involved compartment may be noted when compared with a pre-exercise evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H31749669\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While the history and examination may be strongly suggestive, definitive diagnosis is made by direct measurement of compartment pressures. Diagnostic threshold pressures vary among experts; our approach is described in the text. Compartment pressures should be measured by clinicians with experience performing the procedure using standardized equipment and techniques. Proposed noninvasive diagnostic techniques lack specificity. (See <a href=\"#H502554\" class=\"local\">'Compartment pressure measurement'</a> above and <a href=\"#H504249\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging and other noninvasive diagnostic techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many conditions can mimic CECS, including medial tibial stress syndrome (shin splints), stress fracture of the tibia or fibula, tendinopathy, and deep vein thrombosis. Alternative diagnoses can usually be distinguished from CECS on the basis of a careful history and physical examination. (See <a href=\"#H82888071\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial management consists of conservative measures, such as reducing training volume, addressing strength or flexibility deficiencies, and using orthotics. Patients whose symptoms persist despite conservative measures, who are unwilling to stop the inciting activity, and who have elevated compartment pressures are referred for surgical evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H3905387471\" class=\"local\">'Approach and nonsurgical treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical treatment consists of either fasciotomy or fasciectomy and appears to be successful in most cases, although controlled trials are lacking. Success rates vary, in part depending upon the involved compartment. Most cases involve the anterior or lateral compartment, and these have the highest success rates. Military personnel and female patients appear to have lower surgical cure rates.
