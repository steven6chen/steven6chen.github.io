It causes invasive infections in three populations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonates, particularly in the first few days of life, and infants up to three months of age (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=group-b-streptococcal-infection-in-neonates-and-young-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Group B streptococcal infection in neonates and young infants&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant women (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=group-b-streptococcal-infection-in-pregnant-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Group B streptococcal infection in pregnant women&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults over the age of 65 years or those immunocompromised by underlying medical conditions (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=group-b-streptococcal-infections-in-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Group B streptococcal infections in nonpregnant adults&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>GBS is the most frequent bacterial pathogen in neonates. Maternal antibody against type-specific capsular polysaccharide and perhaps some surface proteins appears to be protective. However, many GBS-colonized pregnant women do not have sufficient antibody levels to these putative antigens at delivery and infants born before 32 weeks of gestation do not benefit from optimal placental transport of available maternal IgG. Although intrapartum (IP) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> four or more hours before delivery can prevent GBS infections in most neonates younger than seven days of age (early-onset disease), concern has been raised that if GBS strains emerge that are resistant to beta-lactams, rates of early-onset disease would increase to the pre-IP antibiotic prophylaxis era. Maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis also has attendant risk for allergic reactions, must be given with each pregnancy, and is invasive and expensive when compared with maternal immunization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal group B streptococcal disease: Prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Vaccination strategies and the composition of potential GBS vaccines are reviewed here. The microbiology and epidemiology GBS infections are discussed separately.

This risk-based strategy called for the routine administration of intravenous penicillin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> to parturient women who are colonized with GBS or those who have risk factors associated with invasive GBS disease in neonates.

This culture-based screening strategy consists of testing for vaginal and rectal GBS colonization in all pregnant women at 35 to 37 weeks' gestation, followed by the administration of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) at the onset of labor or rupture of membranes to culture positive women.</p><p>The culture-based strategy is now the recommended approach for prevention of GBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. However, both the culture-based and risk-based approaches to maternal IAP to prevent early-onset neonatal disease have inherent problems:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IAP administration to all women with positive cultures exposes large numbers of women to unneeded antibiotics, since only about 1 percent of colonized women give birth to infants who develop early-onset GBS infection.

In a large, retrospective cohort study, infants born to mothers treated using the risk factor-based approach were 50 percent more likely to develop early-onset GBS disease than the offspring of mothers treated with the screening approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal IAP does not reduce the incidence of late-onset (7 to 89 days) disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IAP requires intravenous administration (invasive), several hours for effectiveness to be achieved (at least 4 hours with penicillin), and repeated administration in subsequent pregnancies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mothers are exposed to the adverse effects to the antibiotic, including the rare occurrence of anaphylaxis, and the possibility of promoting antibiotic-resistant flora in both the mother and infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>The problem of antibiotic resistance was illustrated in a study of early-onset sepsis in 5447 very low birth weight neonates born at &lt;1500 g between 1998 and 2000 compared with those born between 1991 and 1993 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Although the incidence of neonatal sepsis had not changed significantly (15.4 versus 19.3 per 1000 very low birth weight infants), fewer GBS and more Escherichia coli infections occurred during the later time period. Sixty-five percent of the women in the more recent cohort had received antibiotics during hospitalization for the delivery, and 85 percent of E. coli strains isolated from neonates in the more recent cohort were resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>. Ampicillin-resistant isolates were much more common in neonates whose mothers had received IAP with ampicillin (93 versus 20 percent). However, subsequent studies have not suggested a clear association between IAP in women delivering term infants and resistance among GBS strains colonizing or infecting their neonates.

GBS possesses two distinct saccharides, the group B carbohydrate (common to all strains) and the surface capsular polysaccharide (CPS). The group B carbohydrate is more closely associated with the cell wall of GBS than are CPS or protein antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The GBS noncapsular polysaccharide antigen is not a vaccine candidate as antibodies to this protein are not protective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">GBS capsular polysaccharide antigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CPS antigens confer serotype specificity for GBS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Composition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With only two exceptions, all GBS CPS are composed of 150 or more oligosaccharide repeating units of galactose, glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylneuraminic acid. Type VI CPS lacks N-acetylglucosamine, and serotype VIII is the simplest structure, containing only four sugars including rhamnose, a saccharide previously only found in the group B carbohydrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Each CPS has a unique structure containing backbone saccharides and side chains comprised of mono-, di-, or trisaccharides. Despite containing similar sugars, each CPS is antigenically distinct, even types Ia and Ib in which the sole difference resides in a single linkage in the attachment of galactose to N-acetylglucosamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Sialic acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of N-acetylneuraminic (sialic) acid is preserved among all GBS CPS whose structures have been elucidated.

A monoclonal antibody directed at the alpha C protein identified a series of regularly spaced bands on Western blots of extracts from alpha-C-protein positive GBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/25,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28</a>]. Moreover, the monoclonal antibody protected mice challenged with an alpha-positive strain of GBS. The cloned alpha C protein from the prototype <span class=\"nowrap\">Ia/C</span> strain A909 elicited antibody that protected mice from lethal challenge with alpha-positive GBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Deletions in the repeat region of the alpha C protein have been noted in both human isolates and an immune mouse model and appear to reflect a form of antigenic variation resulting in escape from host immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In contrast to antibodies raised to the wild-type, 9-repeat alpha C protein (antibodies raised to the 1- or 2-repeat species) bind with high affinity to both 1-repeat and 9-repeat alpha C protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In addition, alpha C protein with one or two repeats is more immunogenic and more protective than is the 9-repeat protein. A 2-repeat alpha C protein conjugated to type III CPS has been reported to confer significant protection against GBS strains expressing either antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Thus, like the beta C protein, the alpha C protein is able to function both as a carrier protein for the CPS and as a protective immunogen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Other proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other GBS surface proteins share the properties of trypsin resistance and a ladder-like pattern on Western blot with the alpha C protein. The R proteins are present in many type II and III strains and may be involved in protective immunity in animals and in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/24,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,35</a>]. One group reported the presence of a novel protein termed &quot;Rib&quot; in most type III GBS strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This protein seems to be analogous to the alpha C protein. It is a protective antigen that appears variable in molecular size in different strains and produces a ladder on western blot. Nucleotide sequencing of the gene for Rib protein reveals extensive homology to the alpha C protein, and it contains a series of identical tandem repeats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Type V and type VIII clinical GBS isolates contain alpha-like proteins; nearly all GBS strains appear to express a surface protein that is a member of this family, regardless of serotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Recombinant alpha C protein 3, found on most GBS types V and VIII isolates has been shown to be a viable vaccine candidate and an effective carrier protein for CPS antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. BibA, a surface-associated adhesin found predominantly on type III clinical isolates, confers active protection in mice against GBS challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Finally, surface pilus island (PI) proteins, such as PI 1 and PI 2a, also may be protective against invasive neonatal GBS disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Genomic approaches to vaccine development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The availability of complete genome sequences for GBS has led to the discovery of novel vaccine candidates. Analysis of genomes from eight GBS strains representing five serotypes (Ia, Ib, II, III, and V) identified 589 potential surface-exposed and secreted proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Of these, 312 could be expressed in recombinant form and used for production of antibodies. Many of the antibodies recognized a single predominant protein on Western blot of GBS extracts or could detect a surface exposed protein of GBS by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.</p><p>A combination of four of these candidate proteins given to female mice provided protection to their offspring against GBS strains of the above five serotypes plus serotype VIII [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

CPS were the initial GBS vaccines tested in humans. Conjugation to protein antigens such as tetanus toxoid or CRM197 enhances the immunogenicity of these vaccines.

These results in animals were followed by the observation that susceptibility of newborns to GBS infections correlated strongly with a lack of maternal antibody to the GBS CPS antigen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

A subsequent prospective, case-controlled study of mothers who delivered neonates with early-onset GBS disease and matched mothers colonized with the same CPS types but who delivered healthy neonates showed that naturally-occurring maternal delivery antibody of &ge;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">&micro;g/ml</span> specific to CPS types Ia, III, and V was associated with a decrease in disease risk by 70 (V) to 90 percent (Ia and III) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first phase I GBS vaccine clinical trial used two native type III CPS vaccines that differed in the method of CPS extraction (EDTA compared to TCA extraction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Both vaccines passed safety tests in animals before administration to 40 healthy adults, 33 of whom had low levels of antibody to III CPS before vaccination.

The direct correlation (r = 0.913) between maternal delivery and infant cord sera type III CPS-specific IgG levels provided evidence that a strategy of maternal vaccination to prevent infant GBS disease would be feasible if the immunogenicity of the vaccine was improved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The observation that humoral responses to poorly immunogenic carbohydrate antigens could be augmented by covalent attachment to proteins was first reported in 1931 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. GBS type III oligosaccharide and CPS conjugate vaccines were developed and shown to be more immunogenic in rabbits and mice compared to uncoupled CPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-54</a>]. These GBS CPS conjugate vaccines were generated by first creating aldehydes on a selected number of sialic acid sugars on the CPS, then using these aldehydes as coupling sites to proteins by a reaction known as reductive amination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Animal models</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An animal model was developed in which pregnant female mice were actively immunized with GBS conjugate vaccines to induce IgG responses. Their newborn pups were subsequently challenged with a lethal concentration of the homologous GBS strain. As hypothesized, conjugated but not uncoupled GBS CPS was highly immunogenic in adult mice, and the type-specific antibody provided protection against GBS challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first phase I clinical study with the &quot;second generation&quot; of GBS vaccines was performed in healthy women ages 18 to 40 years. Type III CPS coupled to tetanus toxoid (III-TT) was safe and substantially more immunogenic than was uncoupled type III CPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Antibodies elicited to the III-TT conjugate vaccine were predominately IgG class, were functionally active in vitro, and recognized III CPS, indicating that the reductive deamination coupling method did not alter critical conformational epitopes on the type III CPS. Tetanus toxoid was chosen as the carrier protein because of its safety and efficacy as a vaccine when administered to pregnant women worldwide to prevent neonatal tetanus infections.</p><p>Additional GBS CPS-TT conjugates have been evaluated. Type Ia-TT and Ib-TT conjugate vaccines were well tolerated by healthy, childbearing age women, and the serotype-specific IgG response was significantly greater in recipients of the conjugate compared to the uncoupled CPS vaccine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79484\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79484 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In addition, Ia and Ib CPS-specific antibodies elicited by the conjugate vaccines were functionally active in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>] and in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Similar findings were reported for the type II-TT conjugate and unconjugated type II CPS vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>] and for the type V conjugate and unconjugated type V CPS vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>].</p><p>One-third of the cases of invasive GBS disease occur in adults older than 65 years of age. The safety and immunogenicity of a type V conjugate vaccine was assessed in 32 healthy elderly individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The vaccine elicited specific antibodies that were opsonically active, suggesting that a type V conjugate vaccine may benefit this age group.</p><p>A successful formulation for an effective GBS vaccine will include several antigens to provide protection against multiple serotypes. Toward that goal, a trial was conducted in healthy adults to study the safety and immunogenicity of a GBS conjugate vaccine containing both types II and III CPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The bivalent vaccine was well tolerated and postvaccination sera contained functionally active antibodies against both serotypes.</p><p>A trivalent vaccine consisting of GBS Ia CPS, Ib CPS, and III CPS, each coupled to CRM197, was evaluated as a maternal vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The vaccine was found to be well tolerated and immunogenic. The ratio of mother:infant transfer of specific antibody ranged from 0.68 to 0.81.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential GBS protein vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The inclusion of proteins in future GBS vaccines offers several potential advantages over vaccines containing irrelevant proteins such as tetanus toxoid. Since any GBS vaccine will need to be multivalent, the inclusion of surface proteins in the vaccine could simplify a vaccine by covering strains not among the CPS serotypes included. As an example, the inclusion of the beta C protein could eliminate the need for the Ib CPS in a multivalent vaccine. Likewise, the alpha C protein could provide protection against many Ia serotype strains. The inclusion of protein antigens might also enhance the protective efficacy of the vaccine against some strains.</p><p>The use of a GBS protein as a carrier in a CPS conjugate vaccine could reduce the need for &quot;irrelevant&quot; carrier proteins such as tetanus toxoid. A growing number of conjugate vaccines are employing a limited number of carrier proteins, which could lead to increased reactogenicity of a vaccine and the potential for suppression of immune response to the CPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Thus, future clinical trials may well involve vaccines containing one or more GBS surface proteins.</p><p>In an effort to develop a GBS vaccine against more than one serotype of GBS, a conjugate vaccine composed of type III CPS and beta C protein was synthesized and shown to elicit protective antibodies against both components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. This vaccine was able to protect neonatal mice from challenge with strains that bore either the beta C protein or the type III CPS. The antibodies elicited were broadly and strongly opsonic against a variety of strains that expressed either antigen.</p><p>Other GBS surface proteins have the potential to be effective vaccine candidates. Streptococcal C5a peptidase is located on the surface of the organism and conserved among GBS serotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Rabbit antisera to this enzyme promoted killing of GBS by macrophages in vitro. C5a peptidase has also been shown to function as an effective carrier protein for GBS polysaccharide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Surface immunogenic protein (Sip) is a 53 kDa protein that is also highly conserved among GBS isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>]. Active vaccination of mice with purified Sip resulted in protection against lethal challenge with GBS serotypes Ia, Ib, II, III, V, and VI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>The recombinant form of another GBS surface protein, called LrrG, protected mice against lethal GBS challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. This observation suggests that this highly conserved protein may be a viable vaccine candidate.</p><p>Discovery of GBS pili [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] and of the high prevalence of pilus islands in clinical GBS isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>] suggests a potential role for these surface structures as viable vaccine antigens. Compared with controls, sera from mothers whose babies developed early onset GBS disease had significantly lower levels of IgG specific to pilus 1 and pilus 2a, but not to pilus 2b [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>Finally, antibodies against a combination of unique proteins have been reported to promote opsonophagocytosis in vitro and protection in an animal model of GBS sepsis. This candidate vaccine (GBS-NN, a fusion of two GBS protein domains, Rib and Alpha C) was given to 240 healthy women in a phase 1 trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

Since these patients became bacteremic despite protective levels of antibody, other factors must account for the increased susceptibility to GBS infection in adults with malignancy, diabetes, liver disease, or age 65 years or older without underlying illness.</p><p>An alternative explanation is that higher levels of antibodies to CPS might be needed for protection in adults. In a cross-sectional study of adults &ge;65 years of age, the serum level and functional activity of type V GBS CPS-specific IgG was measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Thirty-six of 40 adults studied (90 percent) lacked GBS antibody in amounts sufficient to be effective against GBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. There was no apparent impairment of neutrophil function, which is another possible risk factor for susceptibility to GBS.</p><p>One study explored the immune response following GBS bacteremia in 100 adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaccines-for-the-prevention-of-group-b-streptococcal-disease/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Substantial immune responses to both the CPS and pilus islands were observed in convalescent sera, but many individuals had relatively high concentrations of CPS-specific IgG in their acute sera.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21182546\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group B streptococcus (GBS) is the most frequent bacterial pathogen in neonates. Most pregnant women who are colonized with GBS do not have sufficient antibody levels at delivery to provide passive protection from infection for the neonate. The current prevention approach of antenatal culture-based screening and maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis for those women who are positive is effective but has several downsides, including the risk of adverse effects, the selection for resistant organisms, and the lack of efficacy at reducing late-onset disease. Thus, development of an effective vaccine is an attractive strategy for the prevention of neonatal GBS disease.
