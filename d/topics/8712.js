It is one of the more common causes of thrombocytopenia in otherwise asymptomatic adults.</p><p>Major diagnostic concerns in an adult with suspected ITP are distinguishing ITP from other causes of thrombocytopenia, which often have a similar presentation but may require completely different management approaches, and determining whether the ITP is primary or secondary to an underlying condition that might also benefit from treatment.</p><p>The lack of a sensitive or specific diagnostic test for ITP, and large number of other potential causes of thrombocytopenia, some of which may be overlooked (eg, drug-induced, congenital platelet disorder), also contribute to the challenges in diagnosing ITP.</p><p>Here we discuss the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of primary ITP in adults, as well as the differential diagnosis of ITP and causes of &quot;secondary ITP&quot; due to other conditions.</p><p>Other issues are discussed in separate topic reviews:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other causes of thrombocytopenia</strong> &ndash; Other common causes of thrombocytopenia include drug-induced thrombocytopenia, chronic liver disease or hypersplenism, and bone marrow suppression or transient drops in platelet count from an infection. Congenital thrombocytopenias are less common but may be mistakenly diagnosed as ITP when first identified during adulthood.

These terms have been replaced by &quot;immune thrombocytopenia&quot; to reflect the known autoantibody mechanism and the absence of purpura in some patients.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of ITP is incompletely understood. Reduced platelet lifespan due to antibody-mediated destruction, as well as impaired platelet production both contribute. The underlying mechanism is thought to involve specific IgG autoantibodies produced by the patient's B cells, most often directed against platelet membrane glycoproteins such as <span class=\"nowrap\">GPIIb/IIIa</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].

Genetic and acquired factors probably contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Two commonly cited acquired events are infections (typically viral) and systemic conditions that disrupt immune homeostasis (eg, autoimmune disease, lymphoid malignancy).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infection</strong> &ndash; Some cases of ITP are associated with a preceding viral infection or, less commonly, bacterial infection. Antibodies against viral antigens may cross-react with normal platelet antigens (a form of molecular mimicry). Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV) have been proposed to cause secondary ITP by this mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide, may attach to platelet surfaces and can increase platelet phagocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Helicobacter pylori infection may contribute to the development of ITP in some cases by an unknown mechanism that might include molecular mimicry, immune alterations, and activities of bacterial products such as CagA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immune alteration</strong> &ndash; Alterations in immune homeostasis might induce loss of peripheral tolerance and promote the development of self-reactive antibodies. Potential examples include the antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, Evans syndrome, hematopoietic cell transplantation, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders (especially those treated with purine analogs), common variable immunodeficiency, and the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16,17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Alternative immunologic mechanisms involving T cells have also been postulated to cause ITP, including T cell-mediated cytotoxicity and defects in the number <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function of regulatory T cells (Tregs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-27</a>]. The latter mechanism is supported by a study showing a reduced number and defective suppressive capacity of Tregs in patients with ITP versus controls, and restored Treg numbers and regulatory function, especially in responders, following treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

The reported incidence appeared to increase with the introduction of automated platelet counting; however, this was likely due to an increase in the incidental finding of thrombocytopenia rather than a true increase in the incidence of ITP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. </p><p>A review of published reports determined an annual ITP incidence of approximately 1 to 3 per 100,000 adults in the era of routine complete blood counts; this estimate was based on three large retrospective studies from Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-43</a>].</p><p>Other studies have estimated that one-fifth to one-third of individuals with ITP will be asymptomatic (ie, diagnosed because of an incidental finding of thrombocytopenia); thus, the incidence of symptomatic disease is likely to be much lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. In a database review from the French National Health Insurance System that was limited to ITP cases requiring chronic therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hospitalization, the overall incidence was 2.94 per 100,000 person-years, with a peak in individuals &gt;60 years, reaching 9 cases per 100,000 person-years in men &gt;75 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Other studies have also documented the increasing incidence of ITP with increasing age and a male predominance in individuals &gt;70 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/43,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,47</a>]. </p><p>ITP is often a chronic disease in adults; thus, the prevalence exceeds the incidence. In a review from the United States, prevalence was approximately 8 per 100,000 in children and 12 per 100,000 in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p>Apart from the predominance in males &gt;70 years, ITP is generally thought to be a condition that affects young women.

For those who do have symptoms, these are all related to thrombocytopenia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bleeding.

When present, bleeding typically occurs in the skin or mucous membranes, a pattern sometimes referred to as &quot;platelet-type&quot; bleeding. Severity is variable, ranging from severe hemorrhage, which is rare, to mild petechiae on the extremities. Although the onset of symptoms may be abrupt, it is more often insidious. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Petechiae</strong> &ndash; Petechiae are flat, red, discrete lesions that do not blanch under pressure; these often occur in dependent areas of the body (lower legs in ambulatory patients; sacral area in recumbent patients) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F71480\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71480 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F76671\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76671 \">picture 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Purpura</strong> &ndash; Purpura refers to a lesion caused by coalescence of petechiae. Purpura on the skin is sometimes referred to as &quot;dry purpura&quot;; this is not considered a predictor of more serious bleeding. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hemorrhagic blisters in mucous membranes, such as the oral mucosa, are sometimes called &quot;wet purpura&quot;; this finding is more concerning as a predictor of more severe bleeding. New development of wet purpura should prompt reappraisal of the platelet count and the need for ITP therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epistaxis</strong> &ndash; Minimal epistaxis, such as noted only with nose blowing, is common and may not be clinically important. Continuous epistaxis that requires intervention with nasal packing may be predictive of greater risk for more serious bleeding. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe hemorrhage</strong> &ndash; In contrast to the more common findings of petechiae and purpura, more severe hemorrhage, such as intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), overt gastrointestinal bleeding, and hematuria, is uncommon. This was illustrated in a systematic review of prospective clinical studies, which included 5336 adults with primary ITP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

The frequency of severe bleeding may also increase with age and comorbidities.

The greatest concern for bleeding is with lower counts in the range of &lt;10,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">20,000/microL</span>. There are no obvious factors that determine the degree of thrombocytopenia for any individual patient.</p><p>The platelet count level, while low, tends to remain fairly constant in patients with ITP in the absence of therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other intercurrent illnesses such as viral infections. This differs from some cases of drug-induced thrombocytopenia, in which larger variations in platelet count may occur due to intermittent exposure.

However, if performed, bone marrow will show normal cellularity, normal or increased numbers of megakaryocytes, and normal erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis. In some patients, a shift towards younger megakaryocytes with lesser degrees of nuclear polyploidy and less evidence of platelet production may be noted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=megakaryocyte-biology-and-the-production-of-platelets#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Megakaryocyte biology and the production of platelets&quot;, section on 'Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H224443\"><span class=\"h2\">Correlation of bleeding and thrombocytopenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with more severe thrombocytopenia (eg, platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;10,000/microL)</span> are more likely to have serious bleeding than those with higher counts. However, the correlation between platelet count and bleeding risk is weak, and few data describe the risk of clinically important bleeding at different levels of thrombocytopenia.</p><p>Furthermore, the incidence of bleeding in ITP cannot be inferred from rates of bleeding in other forms of thrombocytopenia associated with abnormal platelet function, because circulating platelets in patients with ITP are younger and have greater hemostatic effectiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-thrombocytopenia-itp-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. As a result, bleeding manifestations in patients with ITP are less severe at equivalent platelet counts than in patients with thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow suppression.</p><p>Because the risk of bleeding is low with platelet counts &gt;10,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">20,000/microL,</span> we generally do not use therapies to increase the platelet count in individuals with a stable platelet count above 20,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">30,000/microL</span> unless there are other comorbidities that increase bleeding risk. This slightly higher threshold allows a measure of safety, and accommodates minor day-to-day fluctuations in platelet count, as discussed in detail separately.

Unlike ITP, patients with infectious thrombocytopenia typically recall an acute symptomatic period with fever, rash, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> constitutional symptoms; and the thrombocytopenia associated with self-limited infections is typically transient.

Like ITP, early HIV infection may be associated with normal red blood cell and white blood cell counts, and early HCV infection may be associated with normal liver function tests.

Unlike ITP, patients typically have elevations in transaminases and may have a palpable liver or spleen; however, hepatosplenomegaly may be difficult to appreciate in some patients. In severe cases of liver disease, patients may also have coagulation abnormalities, which are absent in ITP. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Microangiopathic processes</strong> &ndash; Microangiopathic processes include congenital and acquired conditions associated with diffuse microvascular coagulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombosis; these processes cause thrombocytopenia from platelet consumption in thrombi. Examples include thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Like ITP, these conditions cause thrombocytopenia and sometimes bleeding. Unlike ITP, TTP, HUS, and DIC are associated with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (eg, schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear); DIC is also associated with coagulation abnormalities. Unlike individuals with ITP, who are otherwise well, patients with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia are often quite ill.

Like ITP, these disorders may be characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia with mild or no clinical bleeding. Unlike ITP, these conditions may have morphologic abnormalities of platelets on the peripheral blood smear. Examples include giant platelets (the size of red blood cells) in May-Hegglin anomaly or Bernard-Soulier syndrome, or an absence of platelet granules in gray platelet syndrome. Some individuals may also have other characteristic clinical features associated with inherited syndromes; these are discussed in detail separately.

However, patients with the type 2B subtype of VWD may also have mild thrombocytopenia. Unlike ITP, bleeding severity may be out of proportion to the platelet count; there may be a family history of VWD; and laboratory testing will reveal characteristic findings of type 2B VWD including reduced ristocetin cofactor activity and a decrease in high molecular weight von Willebrand factor multimers.

Unlike ITP, these syndromes are typically progressive and often associated with other cytopenias (eg, anemia, leukopenia) as well as dysplastic cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased numbers of immature cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Rarely, however, MDS may present with isolated thrombocytopenia; this finding is most often seen in those with an isolated deletion in the long arm of chromosome 20 (20q).

Like ITP, patients may present with purpura. Unlike ITP, the pattern of distribution in vasculitic purpura does not reflect dependent areas of the body, and the purpuric lesions in vasculitic purpura are palpable.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ITP is a common acquired bleeding disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78231\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78231 \">figure 1</a>). ITP is often a chronic disease in adults; thus, the prevalence (approximately 12 per 100,000 adults) exceeds the incidence. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of ITP are all related to bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombocytopenia. Bleeding may occur in up to two-thirds of patients; however, many are asymptomatic. Serious bleeding is seen most often in individuals with platelet counts &lt;10,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">20,000/microL,</span> but the overall correlation between bleeding and the platelet count is weak. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with presumed ITP who have severe bleeding, urgent hospitalization with early involvement of the consulting hematologist is appropriate; however, the vast majority of cases of ITP are diagnosed and managed without hospital admission. (See <a href=\"#H225867\" class=\"local\">'Hematologist referral; hospitalization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of ITP requires that other potential causes of thrombocytopenia be eliminated. Many potential causes are obvious from the history, physical examination, and review of the complete blood count (CBC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77063\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77063 \">table 2</a>). However, thrombocytopenia caused by a medication or ingested substance may require specific questioning (or review of the hospital record) to elicit the responsible agent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73618\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73618 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60296\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60296 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H109283180\" class=\"local\">'Preliminary evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once other obvious conditions have been excluded, few remaining diagnostic studies are needed. We review the peripheral blood smear (or request review) and test all patients for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. (See <a href=\"#H110530130\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional laboratory testing reserved for selected patients may include coagulation studies, transaminase measurements, rheumatologic testing, and bone marrow examination.

(See <a href=\"#H109283194\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of ITP includes a variety of inherited and acquired conditions such as drug-induced thrombocytopenia, infections, liver disease and hypersplenism; microangiopathic processes; congenital thrombocytopenic conditions; and bone marrow disorders such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
