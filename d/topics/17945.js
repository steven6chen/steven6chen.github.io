Up to 50 percent of patients with scleritis have an underlying systemic illness, most often a rheumatic disease.</p><p>This topic will review the treatment of scleritis. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of scleritis are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-scleritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of scleritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of scleritis always requires systemic therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, or other immunosuppressive drugs. In one study, 67 percent of patients required either high-dose glucocorticoids or the combination of high-dose glucocorticoids and another immunosuppressive agent to control the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-scleritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In some patients, particularly those with peripheral ulcerative keratitis or scleromalacia perforans, surgical intervention is required to preserve vision or prevent globe rupture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment must be individualized according to the severity of the patient's disease. As an example, patients with either necrotizing anterior scleritis or posterior scleritis require more intensive therapy than those who present with non-necrotizing disease of the anterior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-scleritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The presence of a systemic inflammatory illness may also dictate an intensive course of therapy, even if the particular subtype of scleritis would normally call for a more benign treatment approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-scleritis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of scleritis&quot;, section on 'Scleritis subtypes'</a>.)</p><p>It is absolutely essential that scleritis be managed by an ophthalmologist expert in the care of these patients and by a rheumatologist experienced in employing and managing the immunosuppressive therapies required to treat ocular inflammation.</p><p>In the absence of systemic disease features that dictate the overall approach to therapy, two major principles guide the treatment of scleritis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diffuse and nodular subtypes of anterior scleritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55397\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55397 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55940\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55940 \">picture 2</a>) have a reasonable likelihood of responding to NSAIDs alone. If the clinician's sense is that a more aggressive approach is required from the outset, or if NSAIDs fail to control the scleral inflammation, most of these patients respond to high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>.

Most patients have generally been treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> as well as high-dose glucocorticoids, but concern about the adverse effects of cyclophosphamide and the success of rituximab-based regimens in treating systemic conditions often accompanied by scleritis (eg, rheumatoid arthritis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis [Wegener's]) have made <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> plus glucocorticoids often the initial treatment of choice.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NSAID therapy is primarily recommended for patients with the diffuse and nodular subtypes of anterior scleritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55397\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55397 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55940\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55940 \">picture 2</a>).

This regimen is continued for the first four to six weeks of therapy with ongoing assessment of the clinical response. The initial prednisone dose should not be continued beyond six weeks (and usually only four weeks) because of the potential for glucocorticoid-related morbidity.

Given the frequency of severe scleritis as a manifestation of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and the strong evidence that rituximab is effective in this setting, it is reasonable to extrapolate the efficacy of rituximab to scleritis. Moreover, two rituximab regimens are effective in the treatment of rheumatic conditions, and either of these regimens are acceptable as the first-line approach for the treatment of patients with scleritis refractory to glucocorticoids alone. The administration of 1 g of rituximab twice (with the two doses separated by approximately 15 days) is the regimen approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, the use of four 375 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> doses administered one week apart have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-resistant-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis#H13942280\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment-resistant granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis&quot;, section on 'Rituximab in patients with cyclophosphamide resistance'</a>). It is important to note, however, that in the absence of a controlled trial in the treatment of scleritis, the approach remains empirical. Should a patient not respond within four weeks to the rituximab regimen, it would be advisable to try an alternate therapeutic approach, possibly including more conventional treatments such as cyclophosphamide.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cataract-in-adults#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cataract in adults&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Posterior segment complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most posterior segment complications represent the effects of posterior scleral inflammation on ocular structures adjacent to the sclera, such as the retina and optic nerve. The most serious complication is exudative retinal detachment that involves the macula, thereby resulting in variable but permanent vision loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient with active scleritis is at significant risk for losing sight. Additionally, scleritis may be a sign of ongoing active inflammation at nonocular sites and a sign that the underlying disease process needs more aggressive management. The treatment of scleritis varies according to disease subtype. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular comorbidities are common with scleritis, as are systemic side effects from the treatments. A team approach involving the rheumatologist and the ophthalmologist is often required for optimal management of these patients. Up to 50 percent of patients with scleritis have an underlying systemic illness, usually a rheumatic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-scleritis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of scleritis&quot;, section on 'Systemic disease associations'</a> and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as the initial treatment of choice for diffuse and nodular forms of anterior scleritis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), which are less severe forms of the disease. One agent commonly employed in this setting is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> (25 to 75 mg taken orally three times daily). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Necrotizing or posterior scleritis are subtypes that are more likely to be associated with permanent ocular complications; thus, we suggest glucocorticoids or the combination of glucocorticoids and another immunosuppressive agent (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>) from the start of therapy in such patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A common starting dose for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> in this setting is 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, up to a maximum daily dose of 80 mg.

Some patients with particularly aggressive disease may require four rituximab doses (375 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> administered weekly) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with disease refractory to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, with dose adjustments for patients with decreased renal function) to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
