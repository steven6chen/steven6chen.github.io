In this condition, blood is pumped from the heart through a single truncal valve into a truncal artery, which gives rise to the aorta and the pulmonary arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83846\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83846 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The anatomy, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of TA will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14644487\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported incidence of TA ranges from 6 to 10 per 100,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/truncus-arteriosus/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Although only 0.7 percent of all congenital heart lesions are due to TA, it accounts for 4 percent of all critical congenital heart disease cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/truncus-arteriosus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14644494\"><span class=\"h1\">EMBRYOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the early stages of a normally developing heart, the great arteries originate from a single truncal root. A wall forms within this root (truncoconal septum) that divides the root into a fully developed main pulmonary artery and ascending aorta by the end of the fifth week of gestation. Over the next two weeks of development, there is closure of the conal (infundibular) septum as the truncoconal septum fuses with the endocardial cushions and the interventricular septum, which separates the newly formed right and left ventricle.</p><p>Disturbances in the development of the truncoconal septum result in conotruncal abnormalities including TA. The lack of wall development also impairs the creation of separate aortic and pulmonary valves, resulting in the single truncal valve associated with TA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/truncus-arteriosus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Neural crest cells and derangements in neural tube development have been associated with the development of TA and other conotruncal malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/truncus-arteriosus/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H267457459\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14644501\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with TA, there is a common arterial trunk that is positioned above the ventricular septum. It provides blood for the systemic and pulmonary circulation, and coronary arteries. In the repaired or unrepaired heart, the TA is generally larger in diameter than the normal aorta at a given age. Other associated findings are common and include truncal valve and aortic arch abnormalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267457482\"><span class=\"h2\">Truncal valve</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In TA, there is a single semilunar valve. Valve anatomy is variable as illustrated in a review of 400 cases that reported the presence of a trileaflet, quadricuspid, and bicuspid valve in 69, 22, and 9 percent of patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/truncus-arteriosus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Leaflets are generally thickened, and can be deficient in size or restricted in motion. These combinations can result in an incompetent valve with varying degrees of stenosis or regurgitation, although the latter is more frequently encountered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267457496\"><span class=\"h2\">Aortic arch anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with TA, aortic arch anomalies are common and include the following, with their relative frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/truncus-arteriosus/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right aortic arch &ndash; 21 to 36 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interrupted aortic arch &ndash; 11 to 19 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoplastic aortic arch (with or without coarctation of the aorta) &ndash; 3 percent</p><p/><p>A patent ductus arteriosus is especially important in patients with an interrupted or hypoplastic aortic arch as it provides blood flow to the descending aorta, thereby preventing severe life-threatening heart failure due to low cardiac output.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267457703\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventricular septal defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most patients, there is a malalignment large ventricular septal defect (VSD). This combination of a single overriding great artery, VSD, and frequent right-side aortic arch is similar to that seen in patients with tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary atresia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172309025\"><span class=\"h2\">Coronary artery and conduction system anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with TA, the coronary arteries are often abnormal in their origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/truncus-arteriosus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The coronary artery pattern is highly variable and there is no particular pattern associated with TA. These variations are important considerations for surgical repair.</p><p>In addition, there may be variation in the conduction system, which also affects surgical repair. The location and structure of the sinus node and atrioventricular node are normal, but the atrioventricular bundle course may vary and is generally dependent on the location of the VSD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/truncus-arteriosus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24639788\"><span class=\"h3\">Other cardiac anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other cardiac anomalies that have been observed include secundum atrial septal defect (9 to 20 percent), mild tricuspid stenosis (6 percent), aberrant subclavian arteries (4 to 10 percent), and a persistent superior vena cava draining into the coronary sinus (4 to 9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/truncus-arteriosus/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>]. A patent ductus arteriosus is present in about half of the patients with TA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H267457489\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several different methods that describe the various forms of TA based on differences in the pulmonary arterial architecture and the presence of aortic anomalies. These include the initial Collett and Edwards classification, followed by the Van Praagh classification, and a modification of the Van Praagh classification proposed by the members of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Congenital Heart Surgery Database committee and European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83846\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83846 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/truncus-arteriosus/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>].</p><p>The classifications most commonly used are the Collett and Edwards (CE) and Van Praagh (VP) schema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24639834\"><span class=\"h2\">Collet and Edwards classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CE classification, the first proposed and most simple system, consists of the following four classes based on pulmonary architecture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83846\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83846 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/truncus-arteriosus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In type I, a main pulmonary artery is present, and arises from the left side of the truncal root.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In type II, the right and left branch pulmonary arteries have two closely-spaced but separate origins from the posterior aspect of the truncal root.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In type III, the branch pulmonary artery origins are widely separated from the truncal root.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the original type IV, the pulmonary arteries originate from the descending aorta.

Deletions in three genes in this locus (<em>TBX1</em>, <em>CRKL</em>, and <em>ERK2</em>) cause neural crest cell and anterior heart anomalies seen in patients with DiGeorge syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/truncus-arteriosus/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. It appears that 22q11.2 deletions are associated with one of every four to five cases of TA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/truncus-arteriosus/abstract/23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,25</a>].

Over the first several weeks of life, however, the PVR drops and left-to-right shunting increases to the point that heart failure occurs. Although the pathophysiology is similar to that of isolated ventricular septal defects, heart failure usually presents earlier in patients with TA.</p><p>In patients with TA, there is mixing of the systemic and pulmonary venous blood flow as the single trunk receives output of both ventricles. The pathophysiology and its clinical manifestations are dependent on the volume of pulmonary blood flow determined by the PVR, the degree of truncal valve insufficiency (regurgitation), and whether there are significant aortic anomalies.</p><p>The normal transition at birth results in changes in PVR and blood flow that affect TA pathophysiology and its clinical manifestations. At birth, there is little cardiovascular instability in patients with TA as the initial persistence of high pulmonary fetal PVR restricts pulmonary blood flow. There is mixing of systemic and pulmonary blood at the intracardiac and arterial levels, resulting in mild or moderate cyanosis. However, with the normal fall of PVR in the first weeks of life, pulmonary blood flow is greater than normal, leading to pulmonary fluid overload and heart failure. Pulmonary vascular obstructive disease may develop in surgically uncorrected patients with large pulmonary blood flow, with changes noted as early as six months of age.

These factors increase the likelihood and severity of heart failure.</p><p>Neonates with interrupted aortic arch or critical coarctation are at risk for heart failure when the ductus arteriosus closes as the ventricular outflow obstruction leads to pressure overload.

This was illustrated in a case series from a single tertiary center in the United States of 136 patients with TA, including 43 patients (32 percent) who were diagnosed prenatally with TA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/truncus-arteriosus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In this cohort, five patients with TA were misdiagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonary atresia (TOF-PA). In contrast, five patients diagnosed with TA were found to have either TOF-PA or double-outlet right ventricle. Of the 43 fetuses diagnosed prenatally, there were 24 live births, 17 elective terminations, and 2 lost to spontaneous abortion. Of the live-born infants, four died in the newborn period without attempted surgical repair, including three with nonspecified extracardiac abnormalities, which were the primary cause of death.</p><p>Similar difficulties with accurate prenatal diagnoses of TA were observed in a prospective study of all fetuses and infants with congenital heart disease diagnosed at three referral centers in the United States between 2004 and 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/truncus-arteriosus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

A prominent ejection click is frequently heard at the apex or left sternal border. There is usually a systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border. Peripheral pulses are accentuated and often bounding.

Interventions include the following and are discussed in greater detail separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diuretic therapy reduces preload by promoting natriuresis.

However, the interpretation of ventricular enlargement, right ventricular hypertension, and tachyarrhythmias, which are detected by electrocardiography monitoring and exercise testing, is widely variable. In our practice, the left ventricle may be mildly enlarged but must function normally.

The ascending truncal artery then gives rise to the aorta and the pulmonary arteries in various configurations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83846\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83846 \">figure 1</a>). Although only 0.7 percent of all congenital heart disease (CHD) is due to TA, it accounts for 4 percent of all critical CHD cases. (See <a href=\"#H14644480\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14644487\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other associated findings are common and include truncal valve and aortic arch anomalies, and ventricular septal defects (VSDs). A considerable number of TA patients have 22q11.2 deletions and may present with other clinical features of DiGeorge syndrome (eg, hypocalcemia, hypoplastic thymus, cleft palate). (See <a href=\"#H14644501\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;DiGeorge (22q11.2 deletion) syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are several classification schemas used to describe the various forms of TA based on the differences in pulmonary architecture and presence of aortic anomalies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83846\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83846 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H267457489\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with TA, systemic and pulmonary venous blood flows are mixed as the single trunk receives output of both ventricles. The pathophysiology of TA and its clinical manifestations are dependent on the volume of pulmonary blood flow determined by the pulmonary vascular resistance, the degree of truncal valve insufficiency (regurgitation), and whether there are significant aortic anomalies. Most patients with TA present within the first weeks of life with cyanosis, respiratory distress due to pulmonary congestion and heart failure, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a heart murmur (See <a href=\"#H14644508\" class=\"local\">'Physiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14644515\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical nonspecific findings on electrocardiogram and chest radiography include cardiac enlargement and increased pulmonary vascular markings. Other chest radiographic findings may include a right aortic arch in one-third of patients, or an absent thymus (associated with DiGeorge syndrome). (See <a href=\"#H172309301\" class=\"local\">'Tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TA is diagnosed by echocardiography by identifying a single overriding great vessel arising from the heart. Although the diagnosis can be made antenatally, it is often difficult to distinguish TA from other conotruncal cardiac lesions. (See <a href=\"#H14644530\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of TA includes other congenital cardiac conditions that cause early heart failure such as large VSD, pulmonary atresia with VSD, and univentricular heart. TA is distinguished from these other cardiac diseases by echocardiography. (See <a href=\"#H172309478\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend patients with TA undergo primary surgical repair during the neonatal period (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Primary surgical repair in the neonatal period has improved overall survival despite a perioperative mortality of 10 percent. Reintervention is common and includes replacement of right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit, and repair or replacement of truncal valve. (See <a href=\"#H1318125\" class=\"local\">'Surgical correction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to surgical repair, initial medical management includes stabilization of cardiopulmonary function. Patients with heart failure generally require care in the intensive care unit that includes diuretic therapy, inotropic support, angiotensin blockade, and positive pressure ventilation. In addition, for patients with TA and critical coarctation or interrupted aorta, we recommend continuous infusion of prostaglandin E1 (also known as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprostadil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprostadil</a>) to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus and avoid life-threatening heart failure prior to surgical repair (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1318066\" class=\"local\">'Initial medical management'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-coarctation-of-the-aorta#H3040001\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of coarctation of the aorta&quot;, section on 'Neonates and young infants'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Longitudinal follow-up care by a cardiologist with expertise in CHD is required in all patients with TA.
