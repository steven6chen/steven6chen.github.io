There are several treatment options for these patients who are found to have ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Multiple studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of prehospital fibrinolysis in reducing the time to treatment for patients with STEMI and improving outcomes. These studies are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibrinolysis-for-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-initiation-of-therapy#H3476241383\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibrinolysis for acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Initiation of therapy&quot;, section on 'Prehospital fibrinolysis'</a>.)</p><p>The practicability of using general community emergency medical services (EMS) to perform fibrinolysis has been demonstrated in several studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/performance-of-prehospital-fibrinolysis/abstract/14,18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18-22</a>]. The ER-TIMI 19 trial included 20 EMS systems in urban, semi-urban, and rural areas in the United States and Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/performance-of-prehospital-fibrinolysis/abstract/18,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,23</a>]. A straightforward training program permitted paramedical personnel working with a remote medical control physician to screen patients with suspected MI by history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (ECG). Patients with an STEMI received fibrinolytic therapy within a median of 31 minutes after arrival of paramedical personnel in comparison to 63 minutes for in-hospital fibrinolysis in a control group.</p><p>A similar report examined the benefit of prehospital fibrinolysis in the French EMS system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/performance-of-prehospital-fibrinolysis/abstract/19,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,24</a>]. Of 1922 patients with STEMI presenting in November 2000, 180 (9 percent) received prehospital fibrinolysis. Mortality at one year was significantly lower among patients treated with prehospital fibrinolysis than among patients treated with either in-hospital fibrinolysis or primary percutaneous coronary intervention (6 versus 11 and 11 percent, adjusted relative risk [RR] 0.49, 95% CI 0.24-1.00).</p><p>As community prehospital fibrinolysis likely requires a high-volume EMS system and ongoing recertification to be safe and effective, rural systems may struggle to meet performance standards. Maintaining high-volume may be difficult even in urban settings. In a report of two EMS studies performed in Tennessee and Ohio, fewer than 5 percent of patients presenting with chest pain were found to be candidates for fibrinolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/performance-of-prehospital-fibrinolysis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, only 60 percent of field treatment decisions by emergency physicians using transmitted 12-lead ECGs were accurate. A decline in paramedic skills was noted because of infrequent administration of the fibrinolytic agent. As with any high-risk, low-frequency procedure, one approach to ensuring quality is to limit the EMS providers who can administer thrombolytics to those who have greater experience and receive regular training and assessment.</p><p>Other obstacles in addition to volume may exist in rural areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/performance-of-prehospital-fibrinolysis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. At least one provider on each ambulance must be trained in ECG interpretation and fibrinolytic administration, and frequent oversight and <span class=\"nowrap\">retraining/re-credentialing</span> is needed to maintain competency. Online medical control is needed to administer fibrinolysis appropriately and many rural EMS systems employ off line control. Finally, the cost of fibrinolytics can be substantial, especially in settings where numerous ambulances require the drugs to be stocked, but use is infrequent. For these reasons, some rural EMS systems have been reluctant to adopt prehospital fibrinolysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27685240\"><span class=\"h1\">NECESSARY EQUIPMENT AND CAPABILITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EMS systems that employ prehospital fibrinolysis must be able to identify the patient with an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), notify the receiving hospital of their arrival, and treat the patient en route to the hospital. Capabilities vary from system to system, and from country to country, but certain basic capabilities are required:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prehospital 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG)</strong> &ndash; Paramedics must be trained to obtain a prehospital ECG rapidly and efficiently, interpret that ECG (with the help of computerized algorithms), and correlate the ECG with the patient&rsquo;s presenting symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/performance-of-prehospital-fibrinolysis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prehospital ECG transmission capability</strong> &ndash; Prehospital 12 lead ECGs are usually transmitted to a receiving hospital or to the prehospital medical direction facility where an emergency physician or cardiologist can assess them. Receiving facilities may have &ldquo;on-line&rdquo; control, in which the medical director interprets the ECG independently, discusses the patient with the prehospital provider, agrees or disagrees with the paramedic reading, and orders the administration of fibrinolytics. Other EMS systems have &ldquo;off-line&rdquo; control, which allows the prehospital provider to interpret the ECG independently and administer fibrinolysis according to a protocol. Such is the case in many European countries and in Israel, where physicians are often present in the ambulance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/performance-of-prehospital-fibrinolysis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">ECGs are transmitted using either analog or digital technology via land lines or cell phones. The ECG can also be transmitted using some wireless handheld electronic devices equipped with a camera by using a photograph of the ECG.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fibrinolysis checklist </strong>&ndash; Paramedics or prehospital providers must review the indications and contraindications to fibrinolytics to ensure that the patient meets eligibility criteria <strong>before</strong> administering the medication. The use of an explicit checklist ensures the best patient outcomes and minimizes medical and legal risks from inappropriate treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/performance-of-prehospital-fibrinolysis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. We have attached a table listing the absolute and relative contraindications to fibrinolysis in the setting of STEMI and a separate flow sheet for the administration of fibrinolytic therapy that is used by paramedics at the author&rsquo;s home institution (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68784\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68784 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78120\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78120 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prehospital STEMI treatment protocol</strong> &ndash; Intravenous (IV) access and continuous cardiac monitoring should be in place before fibrinolytic medications are given. Fibrinolytics are given along with other indicated therapies such as oxygen and medications including nitrates, beta blockers, antiplatelet agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blockers), and anticoagulants (eg, heparin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bivalirudin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bivalirudin</a>, or low molecular weight heparin). Essential clinical information about these medications, including doses and contraindications, must be included in the prehospital STEMI and fibrinolysis treatment protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/performance-of-prehospital-fibrinolysis/abstract/3,4,12,30-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,12,30-38</a>].

Patients who are not eligible for prehospital fibrinolysis are generally transported to the closest PCI-capable facility for primary PCI. This may include air transport, if indicated. It is imperative to have destination protocols and transport capabilities prepared in advance, prior to the implementation of any prehospital fibrinolysis protocol.

All participants, including hospital administrators, EMS directors, emergency and cardiology department clinicians and support personnel, and paramedics must be fully informed and committed to the program&rsquo;s success.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27685290\"><span class=\"h1\">REQUIREMENTS OF PREHOSPITAL PROVIDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The administration of fibrinolytics in the prehospital setting is held to the same standards as those for the emergency department (ED). As such, quality control and training are of the utmost importance. Consensus statements regarding the requirements for pre-hospital fibrinolysis programs have yet to be published, but in this section we describe the requirements for paramedics at the author&rsquo;s home institution, which could be adapted by any hospital considering implementing a prehospital fibrinolysis program.</p><p>At least one member of a paramedic-EMT or paramedic-paramedic team giving thrombolytic therapy must have demonstrated proficiency in electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation and administration of fibrinolytic medication. Although these proficiencies are certified locally (eg, by the hospital), the process of demonstrating proficiency must be formalized.</p><p><br/>ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients must be rapidly identified by 12 lead ECG to determine if they are candidates for fibrinolysis. Therefore, paramedics must be proficient in obtaining, interpreting, and transmitting an ECG rapidly. We recommend that a paramedic administering fibrinolytics have at least one year of experience and have successfully completed a 50 hour course on 12 lead ECG interpretation and fibrinolytic administration, including a written examination. In addition, the paramedic should observe fibrinolytics being administered to three patients before giving the medication themselves. Time spent in the ED and catheterization labs of local referral hospitals helps paramedics familiarize themselves with the staff and capabilities of these departments.</p><p>In addition to interpreting the ECG, completing the fibrinolysis checklist, and administering fibrinolytics and related medications, prehospital providers must be able to obtain important information about the patient and convey it to their medical control physicians prior to giving fibrinolytics. Such information includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient age, gender</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chief complaint (usually chest pain)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Characteristics of chief complaint (eg, onset, duration, quality, provocative &amp; palliative factors, associated symptoms) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of decompensated heart failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pertinent cardiac and medical history, medications, drug allergies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estimated time to arrival at the receiving facility</p><p/><p>The ability to obtain and understand this information, report it accurately, and discuss it in real time extends beyond typical paramedic capabilities and requires additional training and experience. Therefore, the education and testing of paramedics participating in a prehospital fibrinolysis program should encompass the full breadth of chest pain evaluation, in addition to ECG interpretation and administration of treatments. Practical testing involving simulated STEMI patients with is necessary for paramedics to demonstrate competency. Attached is a checklist used at the author&rsquo;s home institution to assess paramedic performance in prehospital fibrinolysis competency testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63223\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63223 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>It is important that paramedics certified to provide prehospital fibrinolysis participate in periodic classes and reevaluations to ensure skill retention. We suggest quarterly classes (ie, every three months) on ECG interpretation and annual retesting to demonstrate proficiency. Within the author&rsquo;s EMS service, the ability of the crew to administer prehospital fibrinolytics serves as a motivational tool. Not all paramedics are certified to provide this therapy and it gives paramedics a coveted goal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5275312\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT ELIGIBILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients diagnosed with an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) will benefit from attempted reperfusion as soon as possible. In general, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the preferred method of reperfusion for STEMI patients. Patients in facilities without timely access to PCI may require fibrinolytic therapy. Such patients must be screened for absolute and relative contraindications as fibrinolysis carries a risk of severe bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage, when given inappropriately. A table listing the absolute and relative contraindications to fibrinolysis in the setting of STEMI is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68784\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68784 \">table 1</a>). Selection of the appropriate therapy for STEMI, the contraindications and risks associated with fibrinolysis, and the efficacy of the medications used for fibrinolysis are all reviewed separately.

As such, pharmacologic therapies must sometimes be modified to make dosing as simple as possible and maximize the speed of administration. In some cases, medications not typically used in the hospital must be included in the prehospital formulary. A table summarizing the medications used in the acute treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ST elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]) is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75032\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75032 \">table 2</a>).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibrinolysis-for-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-initiation-of-therapy#H69243077\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibrinolysis for acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Initiation of therapy&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibrinolysis-for-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-initiation-of-therapy#H1171216482\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibrinolysis for acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Initiation of therapy&quot;, section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p>Following prehospital fibrinolysis, some patients experience a recurrence of symptoms and signs of STEMI, suggesting reocclusion of the involved coronary artery. This may include recurrent or new ST segment elevations. Recurrence is best treated with PCI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-failed-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis-or-threatened-reocclusion-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of failed fibrinolysis (thrombolysis) or threatened reocclusion in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27685330\"><span class=\"h1\">QUALITY ASSURANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quality assurance and quality improvement programs are essential if prehospital fibrinolysis is to be successful. General information about quality measures is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measuring-quality-in-hospitals-in-the-united-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measuring quality in hospitals in the United States&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with fibrinolysis is an infrequent occurrence for any single emergency medical services (EMS) system, it is important to use each case as a teaching tool. At the author&rsquo;s institution, each case is closely reviewed, with careful attention paid to the performance of and the time required for each of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtaining, interpreting, and transmitting the electrocardiogram (ECG)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Completing the fibrinolysis checklist</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessing the patient and discussing the case with the medical control physician</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administering fibrinolytic medication</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providing feedback to EMS crew members on patient outcome and areas for improvement</p><p/><p>Patient outcome is closely followed as part of quality assurance. Review includes both patients treated with prehospital fibrinolytics and those with STEMI who do not receive prehospital fibrinolytics, and in the author&rsquo;s institution is performed by the shift supervisor, paramedic training officer, and physician medical directors. In addition, the dosing of all medications is reviewed on a regular basis; all medications in the ambulance are regularly checked and clearly labeled.</p><p>We recommend that the ECGs of prospective candidates for fibrinolysis be reviewed in real time prior to fibrinolysis by the medical control physician at the receiving emergency department or hospital in order to avoid misinterpretation. This is particularly important for those patients with ECGs that are difficult to interpret or have equivocal findings, such as bundle branch blocks or left ventricular hypertrophy. This approach has helped us avoid giving fibrinolytics to patients without a STEMI. In addition, our EMS crews regularly review ECGs after the case to improve their interpretation skills.</p><p>One way to reduce the number of missed STEMIs in patients with atypical symptoms (eg, dyspnea, weakness) is to perform a 12 lead ECG on every patient with a relevant chief complaint. This may not be practical in some instances, and we allow our EMS crews some latitude in deciding whether to obtain an ECG, but our chest pain protocol includes liberal criteria for obtaining an ECG. Atypical symptoms associated with acute coronary syndrome are discussed separately.
