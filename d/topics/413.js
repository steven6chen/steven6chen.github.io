The high mortality rate reflects the prevalence of advanced disease at presentation. In population-based series of Western populations, the five-year survival rate for patients with completely resected stage I gastric cancer is approximately 70 to 75 percent, and it drops to 35 percent or less for stage IIB disease and beyond (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111190\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111190 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69815\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69815 \">figure 1</a>).

The positive impact of such therapies on survival in patients with resected gastric cancer has become clearer over time, although there is no consensus as to the best approach.</p><p>This topic review will focus on adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies for noncardia gastric cancer. The epidemiology, staging, and surgical treatment of invasive gastric cancers, the management of early gastric cancer (an adenocarcinoma that is restricted to the mucosa or submucosa, irrespective of lymph node metastasis [T1, any N]), and multimodality approaches for treatment of invasive thoracic esophageal cancers and cancers arising in the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) and proximal stomach (cardia) are covered separately.

Few trials have directly compared these approaches, and the optimal way to integrate combined modality therapy has not been definitively established. A major problem, at least in the United States, is that patients with gastric cancer are commonly taken to the operating room prior to consultation with medical or radiation oncologists. Multidisciplinary preoperative evaluation is preferable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enrollment in available clinical trials is preferred. If protocol treatment is not available or is declined, the following represents our general approach: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most patients with potentially resectable, histologically proven noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma with invasion beyond the submucosa (clinical stage T2N0 or higher (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111190\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111190 \">table 1</a>)) on preoperative staging evaluation, we recommend combined modality therapy over surgery alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">We generally prefer neoadjuvant therapy over initial surgery, especially for those with a high likelihood of developing distant metastases (ie, those with bulky <span class=\"nowrap\">T3/T4</span> tumors, visible perigastric nodes by preoperative imaging studies, a linitis plastica appearance, or positive peritoneal cytology in the absence of visible peritoneal disease). There are no randomized trials demonstrating better outcomes from neoadjuvant therapy versus initial surgery followed by any form of adjuvant therapy. However, given the greater chance of delivering therapy in the preoperative setting and the fact that patients who are at high risk of developing distant metastases may be spared the morbidity of unnecessary gastrectomy if evidence of distant metastases emerges after chemotherapy, we favor this approach. However, upfront surgery remains an accepted approach, especially for patients with clinically staged, nonbulky, T2 or T3 tumors with no visible perigastric nodes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The best chemotherapy regimen is not established, and practice is variable.

It is difficult to know whether the benefit of adjuvant therapy with S-1 demonstrated in the Japanese ACTS-GC trial can be extrapolated to other populations.

For most patients, this entails a D2 rather than a D1 lymphadenectomy, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging guidelines suggest that at least 16 regional nodes be assessed pathologically but that <span class=\"nowrap\">removal/evaluation</span> of more nodes (30 or more) is desirable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-treatment-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The role of induction therapy is unclear.

While patients with T2N0 gastric cancer were included in the Intergroup 0116 trial of observation versus chemoradiotherapy, the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system in use at that time (the third edition) defined T2 disease as invading the muscularis propria or subserosa. It was not clearly specified in the paper whether the enrolled T2N0 patients were limited to patients with subserosal invasion or also included those with invasion limited to the muscularis propria. A subsequent nonrandomized trial that reportedly used the same eligibility criteria as the Intergroup 0116 trial excluded patients with T2aN0 disease (which according to the fifth edition of the AJCC staging system, which was in use at that time, reflected invasion into the muscularis propria but not beyond; invasion into the subserosa was T2b disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-treatment-of-gastric-cancer/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

For most patients, we recommend combined modality therapy over surgery alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2797316399\" class=\"local\">'Benefits'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3313275765\" class=\"local\">'Neoadjuvant/perioperative chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Few studies have compared these approaches, and the optimal way to integrate combined modality therapy has not been definitively established. The decision often is based upon institutional <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> patient preference. A major problem, at least in the United States, is that patients with gastric cancer are commonly taken to the operating room prior to consultation with medical or radiation oncologists. Multidisciplinary preoperative evaluation is preferable, as is participation in clinical trials when possible. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enrollment in available clinical trials is preferred. If protocol treatment is not available or is declined, the following represents our general approach to therapy:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most patients with potentially resectable gastric cancer beyond the submucosa (clinical stage T2 or higher (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111190\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111190 \">table 1</a>)) on preoperative clinical staging, we prefer neoadjuvant therapy over initial surgery, especially for those with a high likelihood of developing distant metastases (ie, those with bulky <span class=\"nowrap\">T3/T4</span> tumors, visible perigastric nodes by preoperative imaging studies, a linitis plastica appearance, or positive peritoneal cytology in the absence of visible peritoneal disease). However, upfront surgery remains an accepted approach, especially for patients with clinically staged, nonbulky, T2 or T3 tumors with no visible perigastric nodes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">The best chemotherapy regimen is not established, and practice is variable. However, for most patients, we suggest the FLOT regimen (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> [LV] plus short-term infusional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> [FU]) rather than an epirubicin-containing regimen (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epirubicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epirubicin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> and infusional FU [ECF], or epirubicin plus cisplatin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> [ECX]), given the preliminary report of a survival benefit for FLOT compared with ECF in the FLOT4-AIO trial (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).

However, results from these trials are not as mature as they are for the MAGIC (perioperative chemotherapy) and Intergroup 0116 (postoperative chemoradiotherapy) trials, and at least for capecitabine plus cisplatin, it is unclear if the results can be extrapolated to Western populations.
