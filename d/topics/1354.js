HH is a genetically determined disorder in which mutations in the <em>HFE</em> gene, or less frequently the transferrin receptor 2 (<em>TFR2</em>) gene or other genes, cause increased intestinal iron absorption. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The resulting clinical manifestations of this disorder (and of other forms of iron overload) are related to the iron deposition in organs, such as the liver, pancreas, heart, and pituitary, and in the cartilage and synovial tissues of the joints. Other major clinical manifestations of iron accumulation include liver disease, skin pigmentation, diabetes mellitus, impotence in males, and cardiac enlargement with or without heart failure or conduction defects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60117\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60117 \">table 1</a>).

Screening for HH and the major genetic, clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic features of hereditary hemochromatosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-hereditary-hemochromatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron deposition and defects in cartilage and in immunologic function have been implicated as factors that contribute to the development of arthritis in hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). <em>HFE </em>gene analysis is useful in understanding the clinical manifestations of HH and patient management. However, the precise mechanisms underlying the arthritis among patients with HH are unknown. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Iron deposition'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Cartilage defect'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Immunologic defects'</a> below.)</p><p><em>HFE</em> mutations were assessed in 31,192 persons of northern European ancestry who were followed for an average of 12 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. C282Y is the <em>HFE</em> allele most commonly associated with HH. The proportion of <em>HFE </em>C282Y homozygotes with documented iron overload-related disease was 28.4 percent in men and 1.2 percent in women. Male C282Y homozygotes with a serum ferritin level of 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> or more were more likely to report fatigue, use of&nbsp;arthritis&nbsp;medicines, and a history of liver disease.</p><p>In another study, the overall prevalence of self-reported osteoarthritis (OA) among 306 patients with HH was higher with C282Y homozygosity than compound heterozygosity (53.4 versus 32.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Indeed, HH&nbsp;is a risk factor for joint replacement surgery for severe secondary OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Heterozygosity for the C282Y mutation is common (6 to 20 percent), but individuals who are heterozygous have not been found to be at increased risk of arthritis. In a study of 3531 patients with HH and 11,794 of their first-degree relatives, who were assumed to be heterozygous for the C282Y mutation, patients with HH, but not their relatives, were at increased risk of arthritis and of need for joint replacement surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Similarly, a study of 1372 individuals has demonstrated that heterozygosity for the C282Y or H63D mutations of the <em>HFE</em> gene was not a risk factor for&nbsp;arthritis in populations of British Isles descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Iron deposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence for a role of iron deposition in the pathogenesis of HH is mixed; some findings support such a role, while others do not. The development of arthritis in hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) cannot be predicted by the level of serum iron or by other measures of iron overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Although high serum transferrin saturation values correspond with the presence of arthritis, a high value may only represent an extended duration of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Iron deposition within joints may trigger a number of pathologic events, such as free radical generation and crystal deposition. In some cases, the generation of free radicals may cause changes in immunoglobulin carbohydrate composition that promote immune complex formation and inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. These alterations are superimposed upon joint changes that result from calcium pyrophosphate deposition.</p><p>The presence of ferric salts within joints may enhance crystal deposition by promoting crystal formation and by inhibiting crystal removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. As an example, the clearance rate of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPP) crystals from joints was measured in a rabbit model of iron deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Synovial hemosiderosis due to the injection of blood into the knee significantly reduced the clearance of CPP crystals, suggesting that the deposition of intracellular pyrophosphates is inhibited by iron.</p><p>Additional evidence of the role of iron was shown in a study in which arthropathy was found in 24 percent (10 of 41) of patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">definite/probable</span> HH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The association observed between this arthropathy, homozygosity for C282Y, and serum ferritin concentrations at the time of diagnosis suggests that iron load is likely to be a major determinant of arthropathy in HH and to be more important than occupational factors. Arthropathy in <span class=\"nowrap\">definite/probable</span> HH was more common with increasing age and was associated with ferritin concentrations &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> at the time of diagnosis (odds ratio 150.89).</p><p>Further support for localized iron overload having a role in the arthritis of HH came from a study of synovial fluid ferritin concentrations in patients with knee OA who underwent HFE genotyping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Concentrations of ferritin in the synovial fluid were found to be two- to threefold higher in knee osteoarthritis patients with <em>HFE</em> gene mutations compared with wild-type patients with OA.</p><p>In contrast to the evidence supporting an important role for iron deposition in causing arthritis in HH, a number of other observations argue against the singularity of this role:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The removal of systemic iron has little effect upon arthritic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The arthritis of HH may not be specific for iron overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Although increased deposition of iron in the synovial tissue is observed in a variety of other diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/11,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,20</a>], degenerative arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], tenosynovial giant cell tumor (formerly known as pigmented villonodular synovitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/11,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21</a>], hemophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and hemarthrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], the pathologic findings in the joints of patients with these disorders differ from those observed in HH (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Joint pathology'</a> below). In addition, the arthropathy in HH is clinically similar to that observed in diseases not associated with iron deposition, including calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cartilage defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An additional metabolic abnormality, independent of the disorder of iron metabolism, may be responsible for an alteration in cartilage matrix among patients with HH, thereby causing arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. This mechanism is consistent with the observation that the arthritis of HH is clinically similar to that of other metabolic disorders, such as hyperparathyroidism, ochronosis, and Wilson's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Increased levels of fragments of parathyroid hormone (PTH) occur in HH and may play a role in the osteoarticular manifestations of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, similarly elevated levels of PTH fragments occur in CPPD disease in the absence of HH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This suggests that the two disorders may share some pathophysiologic mechanisms, in addition to chondrocalcinosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunologic defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormalities in immune cell function may also contribute to the development of arthritis in HH. A variety of immunologic abnormalities have been observed among patients with secondary iron overload and parenteral iron overload, but it is unclear whether such dysfunction is primary or results from the effects of immune-modifying treatments, such as blood transfusions and splenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Reported abnormalities include a decrease in superoxide anion production from neutrophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>], a reduction in CD4, and both expansion of and decrease in CD8-positive T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>].</p><p>Cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells show reduced activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] and use a skewed T-cell receptor repertoire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. It is not clear whether these changes are due to the altered HFE protein or to other pathological changes of HH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">JOINT PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Synovial tissue in hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is brown because of iron deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/20,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,29</a>], and abnormal amounts of iron deposits, little or no signs of synovial inflammation, and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition (CPPD) are characteristic microscopic examination findings. Synovial histology in HH arthropathy resembles osteoarthritis (OA). However, neutrophil invasion is significantly increased, especially in joints with iron deposition, and may stimulate the production of matrix enzymes, causing cartilage degradation and rapidly progressive articular damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Other common findings include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The histological picture of the synovium in HH arthropathy largely resembles a process reminiscent of OA. However, in a study of synovial tissue obtained during surgery from 15 patients with HH, 20 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and 39 with OA, neutrophil invasion was markedly increased in tissues from HH arthropathy, especially in joints with iron deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Accumulation of neutrophils may be crucial for the production of matrix enzymes, which enables cartilage degradation and more rapidly progressive articular damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The intimal and phagocytic cells may contain iron in association with intimal cell hyperplasia and villus formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cartilage may be stripped from the subchondral bone at the level of the tidemark in the calcified cartilage zone. This finding, which may be specific to HH, is caused by increased susceptibility to shearing forces at the bone cartilage interface (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F78124\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78124 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apatite and calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals may occur together with iron deposits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], but there is no spatial relationship. In addition, crystals can be found in the absence of iron deposits. CPP crystals in intervertebral discs are found in the outer and peripheral layers of the annulus fibrosis and of the ligamentum flavum and in association with microfissure formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p>Chronic inflammatory cell infiltration is uncommon.

The arthritic manifestations of HH are diverse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common presenting symptom is twinges of pain upon flexing the small joints of the hand, particularly the second and third MCP joints; joint inflammation is typically minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/19,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,51</a>]. However, an acute presentation can also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Arthritis may then progress to involve the large joints, particularly the hips, knees, and shoulders; such involvement sometimes causes severe disability, requiring surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In a study of 199 patients with HH, joint pain was reported by 72 percent of the patients. Bony swelling may develop and may superficially resemble osteoarthritis (OA). In contrast to the typical findings, some patients have only mild arthralgia at night or upon awakening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In one study that reviewed the clinical features of arthropathy in 25 patients with HH, clinical arthritis was observed in 16 patients (64 percent), and an additional two asymptomatic patients had radiographic evidence of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

Acute attacks of inflammation with bilateral destruction of the MCP joints can occur, and reduced flexion at the MCP joints has been noted. A rheumatoid flare may be mimicked by acute attacks of synovitis, probably resulting from calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/19,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,45</a>].

Patients with hand OA had more tender joints and worse hand function than patients with HH arthropathy.

Abnormal amounts of iron deposits, few or no signs of synovial inflammation, and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition (CPPD) are characteristic findings upon microscopic examination. Neutrophil invasion of the synovium may be seen, particularly in joints with increased iron deposition. In addition, crystals can be found in the absence of iron deposits.

Some patients experience only mild arthralgia. The metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, especially the second and third MCP, and the wrists are commonly affected. Bilateral destruction of the MCP joints and reduced flexion may occur. Other involved joints frequently include the hips, knees, and shoulders and sometimes cause severe disability requiring surgery. Acute arthritis flares related to CPPD may occur, but, while cartilage calcification (chondrocalcinosis) is common, it is usually asymptomatic in patients with HH.

Cartilage calcification most frequently involves the knees and wrists, while the hips, symphysis pubis, and spine may also be affected.
