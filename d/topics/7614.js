Historically, many approaches have been adopted, including gastric evacuation (forced emesis or gastric lavage), intra-gastric binding (most commonly by single or multidose activated charcoal), or speeding transit of toxins to decrease total absorption time (whole bowel irrigation or cathartics). As clinical practice has evolved and understanding of the efficacy, risks, and benefits of decontamination have grown, many practices have fallen out of favor.</p><p>This topic provides an overview of the approach to gastrointestinal decontamination in poisoned patients and a review of the evidence supporting the approach described. The management of intoxication with specific agents and general management of the poisoned patient, including children, are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-approach-to-drug-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General approach to drug poisoning in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-the-critically-ill-adult-with-an-unknown-overdose\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of the critically ill adult with an unknown overdose&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with occult toxic exposure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18993746\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO GASTROINTESTINAL DECONTAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No controlled clinical studies have demonstrated that the &ldquo;routine&rdquo; use of gastrointestinal (GI) decontamination reduces morbidity and mortality in poisoned patients. However, evidence from human volunteer trials and clinical studies suggest that decontamination may reduce the absorption of toxins in the GI tract and may be helpful in select circumstances<sup> </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>The decision to perform GI decontamination is based upon the specific poison(s) ingested, the time from ingestion to presentation, presenting symptoms, and the predicted severity of poisoning. GI decontamination is most likely to benefit patients who:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Present for care soon after ingestion (usually within one to two hours)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have ingested a poison and amount suspected to cause toxicity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not have clinical factors (eg, somnolence) that make decontamination dangerous</p><p/><p>GI decontamination should <strong>not</strong> be performed if the agent and amount ingested are clearly nontoxic, if the agent is considered fully absorbed due to delayed presentation, or if the toxin is not amenable to decontamination.</p><p>It is common practice for intentional and potentially toxic ingestions to be treated with activated charcoal (AC) alone. However, in select scenarios other methods of GI decontamination may be useful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18993753\"><span class=\"h1\">METHODS OF DECONTAMINATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18993761\"><span class=\"h2\">Activated charcoal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activated charcoal (AC) is a highly adsorbent powder made from superheated, high surface area, porous particles produced by pyrolysis of organic material. Its extensive surface area is covered with a carbon-based network that also includes functional groups (eg, carbonyl, hydroxyl) that adsorb chemicals within minutes of contact, preventing gastrointestinal absorption and subsequent toxicity.

AC is also commercially available as a suspension with thickening agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a>, which may help improve palatability and additionally act as a cathartic<sup> </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. </p><p>Because <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> with AC may cause electrolyte imbalances, it is <strong>not</strong> recommended in children.

Treatment with sorbitol-containing AC should be avoided in children unless there is no alternative, and if that is the case it must never be used for more than one dose. According to two randomized trials, aspiration occurs in less than one percent of poisonings and is not increased in patients who receive AC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].

An early study simulating the gastric environment demonstrated that many chemicals adsorb avidly to AC in a dose dependent fashion, but that certain substances &ndash; particularly highly ionic compounds with low molecular weight, mineral acids, and strong bases &ndash; do not bind well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. AC has not been shown to adsorb ethanol, even when administered prior to ethanol ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>A number of volunteer trials support the efficacy of AC when it is administered early after ingestion, with absorption decreased by up to 95 percent or more when AC is administered within five minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. When AC is administered one hour after toxin ingestion, systemic absorption is reduced to the range of 50 to 75 percent, depending upon the toxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. Despite the results of these trials, it is important to remember that volunteer scenarios may differ markedly from actual poisonings with respect to the timing of presentation, amount of toxin ingested, and presence of other factors, such as food in the stomach or drugs that alter GI transit times. </p><p>The results of volunteer trials, designed specifically to evaluate the effect of AC when administered later after ingestion, are less compelling. Two volunteer trials failed to find a statistically significant reduction in absorption when AC was administered at two, three, or four hours following ingestion of therapeutic doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. A third trial demonstrated a small but statistically significant reduction in serum acetaminophen levels when AC was given three hours after drug ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The subjects in all three volunteer trials received therapeutic range doses of acetaminophen, so the results are difficult to extrapolate to larger ingestions that occur in poisoned patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26755400\"><span class=\"h4\">Activated charcoal: Clinical trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Randomized controlled trials of poisoned patients treated with activated charcoal (AC) have failed to demonstrate a consistent impact on clinically important outcomes. However, this may in part be due to methodologic problems in some studies, such as including treatments with AC given several hours after ingestion and treatment of patients with little or no risk of toxicity.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial of 1479 poisoned patients randomly assigned to receive AC or no decontamination reported higher rates of emesis and intubation, as well as a small but statistically significant increase in emergency department length of stay, in patients treated with AC, but overall no significant differences were noted in the clinical course or rates of aspiration between groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial of 71 patients with an overdose of tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) randomly assigned patients to gastric lavage with or without AC and found no difference in serum drug concentrations between groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Of note, most patients presented late following ingestion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial of 327 patients, who were randomly assigned to receive AC or no decontamination, found no difference in length of stay, vomiting, aspiration, intubation, or mortality between groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The authors noted that benzodiazepines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) comprised the majority of toxins, and these drugs would generally not be expected to cause severe toxicity regardless of whether GI decontamination were performed.</p><p/><p>Two observational studies of poisoned patients examined the question of AC efficacy in late-presenting patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective observational series of patients with toxic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> levels who presented more than four hours following ingestion found a lower rate of liver injury among patients given AC in addition to N-acetylcysteine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. For patients given AC between four and eight hours after ingestion, the rate of liver injury (AST or ALT &gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L)</span> was 0 versus 12 percent in the group that did not receive AC. Liver injury rates were also lower for those treated 9 to 12 hours after ingestion (3 versus 52 percent) and 13 to 16 hours after ingestion (10 versus 45 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective series described 981 consecutive patients poisoned with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> who were treated, prior to receiving N-acetylcysteine, with gastric lavage and AC, AC alone, or no decontamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The authors reported that, in patients presenting within 24 hours with ingestions of 10 g or greater, administration of AC prior to N-acetylcysteine resulted in a lower risk of liver injury (defined AST or ALT greater than 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L)</span> compared to treatment with N-acetylcysteine alone (odds ratio [OR] 0.36, 95% CI 0.23-0.58) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

In their joint position paper on single-use AC, the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology and the European Association of Poison Centres and Clinical Toxicologists state that charcoal itself is not responsible for aspiration, but rather administering it improperly (ie, to a patient with an inadequately protected airway; in association with lavage; or instilling it directly into the lung via an improperly placed nasogastric tube) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, when aspiration does occur, poor outcomes cannot clearly be attributed to the charcoal itself rather than the aspiration of acidic gastric contents.</p><p>Given the widespread use of AC, the overall rate of adverse effects, particularly aspiration, associated with its administration is low. In a randomized clinical trial of self-poisoned adults, AC was found to increase the risk of vomiting (23 versus 13 percent in controls) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], but the rate of aspiration was low in both groups (two patients in each group developed aspiration pneumonia out of a total of 1479). A second trial of 327 patients found similar rates of both vomiting (14 and 15 percent, respectively) and aspiration (&lt;1 percent in both groups) in patients treated with AC and those not treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].The results of two observational studies suggest that emesis may occur at a higher rate when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> is added to AC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>A retrospective chart review of 4562 overdose patients looking for predictors of aspiration found that age, male gender, GCS &lt;15, emesis, seizure, tricyclic antidepressant overdose, and an elapsed time of more than 24 hours between ingestion and presentation were all predictors of aspiration pneumonia, whereas AC administration itself was not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Another retrospective chart review of patients who received AC after intubation found that 2 out of 50, or 4 percent, developed an infiltrate not present prior to intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]; however, the two cases of aspiration pneumonia could not clearly be attributed to charcoal administration.</p><p>Other less important gastrointestinal side effects have been reported.
