The latter mechanism leads to stress fractures. An overview of traumatic tibial fractures in adults is presented here. Stress fractures, pediatric fractures of the tibia, and general fracture assessment and management are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-stress-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of stress fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tibial fractures in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-bone-healing-and-fracture-description\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Bone healing and fracture description&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-definitive-fracture-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of definitive fracture management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-techniques-for-splinting-of-musculoskeletal-injuries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic techniques for splinting of musculoskeletal injuries&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tibial fractures occur in both high energy trauma, such as motor vehicle, winter sports (eg, skiing), and cycling accidents, and low energy trauma, such as falls, contact sports, distance running, and other endurance or repetitive impact activities. Injuries caused by high energy trauma are more likely to involve complex and open tibia fractures and fractures in certain locations, such as the tibial plateau [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; injuries caused by low energy trauma more often result in simple transverse or linear tibia fractures. Open fractures of the tibia have high rates of complications and long term problems with limitations of function and pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>In adults and children, closed tibial shaft fractures are the most common long-bone fractures. With greater than 70,000 hospitalizations, 800,000 office visits, and 500,000 hospital days per year in the United States alone, they have major economic consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. According to retrospective series of pediatric tibial fractures over 18 years at one institution, the cause of such fractures may be shifting towards organized sport rather than bicycling injury or other trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Older adults suffer many of these fractures from simple falls, and those with significant osteoporosis incur open or more complex fractures, often with high morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Tibia fractures occur during contact and noncontact sporting events. Several studies demonstrate that a direct, low velocity blow (eg, tackling, kicking) causes approximately 95 percent of sports-related tibial fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. In one five-year retrospective study of 244 tibial fractures seen at a major trauma center, 24 (9.8 percent) occurred during football (soccer) games [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A similar review reported that football (soccer) and rugby accounted for the largest number of sports-related open tibial fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Even when low energy trauma is the cause, concomitant fibular fractures develop in approximately 60 percent of cases. Nevertheless, significant complications develop in fewer than five percent of sports-related tibial fractures and the prognosis is generally good. A similar review reported that football (soccer) and rugby accounted for the largest number of sports-related tibial fractures. </p><p>Avulsion fractures of the lateral and medial tibia may have diagnostic significance in looking for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) ligament injuries. The Segond fracture occurs just below the iliotibial band attached to the fibers of the lateral capsule and is associated with ACL tear. Proximal tibial avulsion fractures at the medial aspect of the bone may be a marker of PCL injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p>The incidence of tibia fractures among football (soccer) players appears to be declining, although the reasons for this remain unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5,6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,12</a>]. Some claim that increased use of shin guards accounts for the decline. However, studies of other contact sports and a case series in which 85 of 100 football-related tibia fractures were sustained by athletes wearing shin guards argue against this claim. Case reports suggest that tibial fractures are occurring in snowboarding, mixed martial arts, and &ldquo;X-game&rdquo; type sports (eg, skateboarding), although demographic data is scant.</p><p>Long term bisphosphonate use, particularly in elder patients, may contribute to tibial fractures. Case reports document insufficiency type fractures of the tibia without known trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-of-bisphosphonate-therapy-in-patients-with-osteoporosis#H4001967\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks of bisphosphonate therapy in patients with osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Atypical femur fractures'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fractures of the tibia in adults are classified clinically based upon their location. Fractures of the proximal tibia are subclassified into those affecting the tibial plateau or the intercondylar notch and avulsion fractures of the tibial tubercle. Researchers use a more complex classification system known as the Arbeitsgemeinschaft <span class=\"nowrap\">Osteosynthesefragen/Association</span> for the Study of Internal Fixation <span class=\"nowrap\">(AO/ASIF)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Locations of fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Issues related to the different locations of tibial fractures are discussed separately in the appropriate topic reviews:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proximal tibial fractures (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proximal-tibial-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proximal tibial fractures in adults&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tibial shaft fractures (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tibial shaft fractures in adults&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distal tibial and medial malleolus fractures (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ankle-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ankle fractures in adults&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tibia is the major weight-bearing bone of the lower leg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54800\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54800 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65590\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65590 \">picture 2</a>). The proximal portion of the bone, the tibial plateau, forms the lower surface of the knee joint. The tibial plateau consists of the medial tibial condyle, the thicker of the two articular surfaces, and the lateral tibial condyle, a relatively thinner and weaker portion of the joint. Separating the medial from the lateral condyle is the intercondylar eminence, an important bony prominence that anchors the attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament. The tibial shaft bridges the distance to the distal tibia which contributes the superior articular surface of the ankle joint at the tibiotalar articulation as well as the medial malleolus. Another key bony landmark is the tibial tuberosity, which sits several centimeters below the joint line and the inferior patellar pole, and serves as the attachment site for the patellar tendon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>A strong fibrous structure, the interosseous membrane, connects the tibia and fibula along the length of the two bones. Proximally, this structure is reinforced by strong anterior and posterior ligaments and forms a synovial joint known as the proximal tibiofibular articulation. Distally, the interosseous membrane and three ligaments, the anterior, posterior, and transverse tibiofibular ligaments, stabilize the superior ankle joint. Another fibrous structure, the crural fascia, surrounds the bones and muscles of the lower leg. Fascial extensions and the interosseous membrane separate the muscles, nerves, and vessels of the lower leg into four distinct compartments. Three of these, the anterior, posterior, and deep posterior compartments, all border the tibia and can be compromised by tibial injury.</p><p>Nerves and vessels lie within the anterior and the deep posterior compartments, and trauma that causes significant swelling in these compartments can result in neurovascular compromise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66579\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66579 \">figure 1</a>). The key blood supply of the tibia arises from periosteal vessels and the nutrient artery. The nutrient artery originates from the posterior tibial artery and enters the posterolateral cortex at the middle third of the tibial shaft near the origin of the soleus muscle. Fractures in this region potentially compromise this blood supply. The periosteal vessels provide a less vulnerable circulation as they derive an abundant blood supply from the anterior tibial artery which travels down along the interosseous membrane. Vascular compromise can arise more proximally from marked effusion of the knee joint, from trauma that affects the popliteal artery before it branches into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries, or at the level of the anterior tibial artery as it branches off the popliteal artery and passes through a gap in the interosseous membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The tibial nerve and several branches provide the key innervation to the muscles of the lower leg and foot. Nerve roots arise from L4 through S3. The posterior tibial nerve parallels the course of the posterior tibial artery and courses through the deep posterior compartment. In the popliteal space branches of the tibial nerve provide innervation to the posterior compartment and to the popliteus muscle. The deep peroneal nerve branches and follows the course of the anterior tibial artery providing innervation to muscles in the anterior lower leg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EXAMINATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Deformity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The injured leg is examined for localized swelling, discoloration, tenderness, shortening, rotation and angulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin integrity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The skin is inspected for evidence of one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contusions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ecchymosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lacerations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Puncture wounds or evidence of secondary infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protrusion of bone fragments indicative of a compound fracture</p><p/><p>If medicolegal considerations warrant, photographs of the injury may be taken with the patient's permission.

Instillation of local anesthetic into the knee joint is sometimes necessary to allow testing (eg, McMurray, Lachman, collateral ligament stressing). Varus or valgus stress that leads to more than 10 degrees of opening is abnormal and, if inferior to the joint line, suggests a displaced fracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unspecified-knee-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unspecified knee pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurovascular integrity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct damage to neurovascular structures may occur with tibial fractures. It is appropriate to test skin sensation, muscle function, distal pulses, and capillary refill to determine the integrity of the nerves and arterial supply to the lower limb.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tibial fractures, particularly open or complex injuries, often involve complications, which may include acute compartment syndrome, neurovascular injuries, and infection. Fat emboli may complicate any type of tibial fracture, ranging from complex fractures treated surgically to simple fractures treated nonoperatively. Although tibial fractures due to low energy mechanisms, such as those sustained during sports, have lower complication rates, even these are susceptible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-fracture-management-early-and-late-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of fracture management: Early and late complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2320535372\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-surgical pain and hypersensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Particularly for patients treated with intramedullary nailing of a shaft fracture, long-term knee pain and hyperalgesia are common complications following surgical treatment of a tibial fracture. This is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults#H2147279\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tibial shaft fractures in adults&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute compartment syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated pressure due to increased volume within a constricting fascia can cause an acute compartment syndrome, which can threaten the limb and constitutes a surgical emergency. Bleeding from a tibial fracture can extravasate into the posterior, deep posterior, or anterior compartment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66579\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66579 \">figure 1</a>) and elevate the intracompartmental pressure. Involvement of the lateral compartment usually implies that a fibular injury is also present. Acute compartment syndrome is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tense swelling of the affected muscles, decreased distal pulses, muscle weakness, increased pain elicited by passive stretch of involved muscles, and impaired sensation due to nerve compression or ischemia may be noted on examination. This may progress to pulselessness, paralysis, and anesthesia. Permanent neuromuscular damage may ensue if the compartment pressure is not decreased promptly by fasciotomy.</p><p>Runners can present with both lower leg pain and injuries that cause a compartment syndrome in the absence of a fracture. Similar symptoms may also accompany or be confused with the shin splint syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-running-injuries-of-the-lower-extremity#H957904\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of running injuries of the lower extremity&quot;, section on 'Chronic exertional compartment syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6199304\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term calf atrophy and sport limitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tibial shaft fractures treated with casting may lead to long term muscle atrophy of the posterior compartments of the calf. One observational study reevaluated 23 patients who at an average age of 18 sustained a tibial shaft fracture treated with cast immobilization for an average of 10 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Sixteen years after the initial injury, CT examination revealed significant calf muscle atrophy. Only 3 of the 23 returned to their previous level of competitive sport, while 10 of 23 returned to recreational sport at a lower level.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6199311\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term function and arthritis risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several observational studies have examined the development of significant osteoarthritis and overall function following treatment of tibial fractures. As expected, more severe injuries are associated with a higher risk of osteoarthritis and disability.</p><p>An observational study of 44 patients with tibial spine fractures that were diagnosed at a mean age of 24 and required internal fixation reported minimal arthritis and good function at a mean follow-up of 16 years (range 5 to 27) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. According to several observational studies, younger patients with tibial plateau fractures managed surgically appear to retain good knee and leg function at five-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. One study with a mean follow-up of 14 years (range 5 to 27) reported mild to moderate arthritis in 31 percent of patients with monocondylar injuries, but more severe arthritis in patients who had 5 or more degrees of malalignment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>A retrospective study with a mean followup of 27 years (range 23 to 32) of 45 patients who sustained tibial fractures in childhood reported that ten had leg length discrepancies, four had rotational deformity of at least 20 degrees, and 2 had developed osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The authors concluded that long-term function was generally good.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1714924\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonunion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small percentage of tibial fractures develop a nonunion. A study of 237 consecutive patients who experienced this complication reported a dramatic impact on quality of life, including effects on mental health and physical activity worse than those reported by patients with decompensated heart failure and as bad as those reported by patients with end-stage osteoarthrosis of the hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>According to data from a national data bank in Scotland, the risk of nonunion appears highest in younger men and older women, and fractures in the region of the tibia and fibula pose the highest risk of all anatomic sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Adults from 30 to 44 years are affected most often. The overall nonunion rate for tibial fractures is 5.4 to 7.5 percent. Open tibia fractures have a 26 percent risk of nonunion versus one percent for closed fractures. High-energy fractures from sport, direct blows, and motor vehicle collisions are more common among the young, and this may affect the age distribution noted. While older adult women patients have a higher risk of nonunion, the older age group does not have a higher overall risk of fracture compared to younger adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain film radiographs are the basic means to assess tibial shaft fractures. Initial studies include anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views. These should incorporate the entire length of the lower leg from knee to ankle. Radiolucent splinting during the procedure reduces the risk of additional injury and allows proper positioning to best visualize fractures.</p><p>Important features that can be assessed from the plain radiographs are the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fracture location and type (eg, transverse, oblique, comminuted)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Displacement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angulation</p><p/><p>Nondisplaced fractures of the tibia have &le;5 mm of displacement and &lt;10 degrees of angulation or rotation.</p><p>Computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are reserved for more complex injuries. MRI has particular value in higher tibial fractures that may extend into the knee joint or are suspected of involving the tibial plateau. MRI also helps delineate associated meniscal or ligamentous injuries.</p><p>Routine use of musculoskeletal ultrasound for the diagnosis of tibial fractures in adults cannot be endorsed, but as more physicians become adept at ultrasound, and the technology continues to evolve, we anticipate that diagnostic ultrasound will likely play a greater role in diagnosing these injuries at the bedside. Preliminary studies of diaphyseal tibia fractures in children are promising [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], but results in adults have been mixed, possibly due to the variable experience and skill of the clinicians performing the examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. While ultrasound has limitations, its sensitivity and specificity for detecting fractures of the metaphyseal and diaphyseal regions of long bones when clinicians experienced with ultrasound perform the study have been reported to be as high as 90 and 96 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].This has led to wider use in the emergency department and sports medicine settings as an initial test to help determine the need for additional imaging or the possibility of return to play [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general principles of fracture management apply to tibial fractures. Management of specific tibial fractures varies with the anatomic location of the fracture and is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proximal-tibial-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proximal tibial fractures in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tibial shaft fractures in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following steps should be performed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimize further tissue injury, particularly of neural and vascular structures, by immobilizing the fracture. Because substantial soft tissue swelling can occur, initial immobilization is generally achieved by applying a removable plaster or fiberglass splint. The splint will later be removed to allow reduction, fixation, or replacement with a better fitting cast.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply ice to minimize swelling and inflammation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevate the injured extremity above the level of the heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give analgesics.</p><p/><p>Most patients achieve adequate pain relief from immobilization, ice, and over-the-counter analgesics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>. Opioid analgesics are occasionally needed to control pain during the first three to five days. Patients requesting opioids beyond this time should be reevaluated for irritation from a poorly fitting splint, a missed secondary injury, or a fracture complication.</p><p>Patients with tibial fractures awaiting urgent surgical intervention should be managed with splinting, ice, and non-opioid analgesics (only if possible) until they have made a decision about surgery. With open tibial fractures, surgical delays of up to 96 hours to manage associated trauma or arrange transfer to a better surgical setting do not appear to worsen outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>Evidence to guide definitive treatment of tibial fractures continues to evolve. Depending upon the location and severity of the fracture and available resources, treatment options may include non-weight-bearing with long leg casting or cast bracing, intramedullary nailing, open reduction and internal fixation, and circumferential external fixation. The choice of treatment affects the return to activity, and so complication and infection rates should be discussed with patients as part of the decision-making process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tibial-fractures-in-adults/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Tibial fractures occur in both high energy trauma, such as motor vehicle, downhill skiing, and cycling accidents, and low energy trauma, such as falls, contact sports, distance running, and other endurance or repetitive impact activities. Injuries caused by high energy trauma are more likely to involve complex fractures and complications. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fractures of the tibia in adults are classified clinically based upon their location (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above). Each type is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proximal-tibial-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proximal tibial fractures in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tibial-shaft-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tibial shaft fractures in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-fractures-of-the-tibia-and-fibula\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress fractures of the tibia and fibula&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-ankle-fractures-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of ankle fractures in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A careful examination of the injured extremity includes an assessment of neurovascular function, leg deformity, skin integrity, and joint stability (if possible). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tibial fractures, particularly open or complex injuries, often develop complications, which may include chronic pain, acute compartment syndrome, neurovascular injuries, infection, nonunion, and fat emboli. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain film radiographs are the basic means to assess tibial shaft fractures. Initial studies include anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views. Ultrasound may be used as an initial screening diagnostic evaluation by experienced clinicians. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial management of tibial fractures includes immobilization, analgesics, elevation, and ice.
