Salivary gland tumors can be benign or malignant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70453\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70453 \">table 1</a>). These tumors can arise from either the major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F115303\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115303 \">figure 1</a>)) or the minor salivary glands, which are located throughout the submucosa of the mouth and upper aerodigestive tract, including the oral cavity (especially the palate), paranasal sinuses, larynx, and pharynx.</p><p>Salivary gland tumors are rare, and information on management is based mainly upon retrospective series, although in the last few years, a concerted effort has led to the completion of several prospective phase II trials, particularly in adenoid cystic carcinoma. The most common malignant salivary gland tumors include mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma, carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, acinic cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified.</p><p>The treatment of locoregionally recurrent and metastatic salivary gland tumors is reviewed here. The initial treatment of locoregional disease and the epidemiology, risk factors, pathology, and clinical features of these tumors are discussed separately.

Depending upon the location of the recurrence, surgery can be associated with significant morbidity and may involve sacrifice of the skin, facial nerve, or deeper structures of the face and neck. However, these potentially morbid surgeries should be considered in patients without distant metastatic disease as surgery in these patients can be potentially curative. </p><p>Even if distant metastatic disease is present, resection of local recurrence may reduce morbidity compared with alternatives, particularly if the patient has already been treated with radiation.</p><p>Postoperatively, most patients with an isolated local recurrence will also receive radiation, except for some of those with low-grade tumors in locations that allow for complete resection with good margins. Irradiation or, in some cases, reirradiation is an option for nonsurgical treatment of locally recurrent salivary gland tumors. If reirradiation is being considered, patient selection is critical due to its toxicity and the likelihood of resistant disease, especially with tumor recurrence within six months after the first course of treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reirradiation-for-locally-recurrent-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reirradiation for locally recurrent head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Radiation therapy (RT) for recurrent disease is generally carried out with conventional external beam RT using photons or electrons. Alternative approaches include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High linear energy transfer (LET) RT (eg, protons, neutrons, carbon ions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-recurrent-and-metastatic-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

If the patient has not yet received radiation to the neck, postoperative radiation may also be used for high-grade tumors, multiple nodes, close margins, or extracapsular lymph node spread. Regional recurrence with adenoid cystic carcinoma is a particular problem since the perineural tumor spread is usually intracranial and surgical resection at the skull base is particularly morbid. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">METASTATIC DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common sites of distant metastatic involvement with malignant salivary gland tumors are the lung, liver, and bone. While potentially curative surgical resection of a solitary site of metastasis may be considered in carefully selected cases, treatment of metastatic disease is most often palliative. </p><p>The natural history of metastatic disease is variable, and some patients remain asymptomatic for protracted periods of time. This is especially true for adenoid cystic carcinomas, particularly when metastases are limited to the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-recurrent-and-metastatic-disease/abstract/9-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-14</a>]. Although there is a wide spectrum of biologic behavior, median survival following the development of metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma was approximately three years in older series, which is substantially longer than expected for most other solid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-recurrent-and-metastatic-disease/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Survival with metastatic disease, especially when only lung metastases are present, is sometimes prolonged, especially for patients identified with asymptomatic disease who are diagnosed using screening computed tomography (CT). </p><p>The goal of treatment of metastatic salivary gland tumors is usually palliation since there is no clear evidence that survival is prolonged by systemic therapy. Watchful waiting may be the most appropriate strategy for patients with indolent disease and few or no symptoms. Systemic therapy may be reserved for those with symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rapid disease progression and for whom a local therapy, such as radiation or metastasectomy, is not appropriate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no adequate clinical trials that define the optimal approach to patients with metastatic salivary gland tumors because of the rarity of these tumors. Whether chemotherapy alters the natural history metastatic salivary gland tumors, especially adenoid cystic carcinoma, is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-recurrent-and-metastatic-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thus, the primary goal of systemic therapy is palliation of disease-related symptoms. </p><p>We suggest an initial platinum and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> combination (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, doxorubicin, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> [CAP]) if the patient is very symptomatic and the goal is to maximize the likelihood of a response. Otherwise, we suggest single-agent therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> (for patients with histologies other than adenoid cystic), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vinorelbine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vinorelbine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitoxantrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitoxantrone</a>. </p><p>Limited data suggest that there are differences in chemotherapy sensitivity among the histologic subtypes of salivary gland tumors. As an example, single-agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> appears to have activity against adenocarcinomas and mucoepidermoid carcinomas but not adenoid cystic carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/malignant-salivary-gland-tumors-treatment-of-recurrent-and-metastatic-disease/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

The most common sites of distant metastatic involvement are the lung, liver, and bone. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For select patients with small locoregional recurrences, we suggest an aggressive approach using surgical salvage and radiation therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In some cases, radiation or reirradiation, with or without concurrent chemotherapy, may be used in place of surgery. These treatments are associated with significant toxicities but may result in long-term survival. The decision between surgery and reirradiation is individually tailored, taking into consideration location and extent of the recurrent tumor, and previous therapies. (See <a href=\"#H264372274\" class=\"local\">'Locoregionally recurrent disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with metastatic disease, the goal of treatment is palliation or prevention of symptoms. Given the often indolent and asymptomatic nature of many metastatic salivary gland tumors, watchful waiting may be the most appropriate strategy for many patients. Systemic therapy should be reserved for patients who are symptomatic or who have rapid disease progression; clinical trial participation should be encouraged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who are very symptomatic and for whom the goal is to maximize the likelihood of a response, we suggest initial treatment with a combination such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> (CAP) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Single-agent chemotherapy is an alternative. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Targeted therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trastuzumab-including-biosimilars-of-trastuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trastuzumab</a> may be appropriate for select patients with overexpression or amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), especially those with mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or salivary duct carcinoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In rare cases, patients with solitary pulmonary or liver metastases may be considered for surgical resection.
