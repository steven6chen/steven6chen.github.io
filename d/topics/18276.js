Regardless of which strategy is used, we change one treatment at a time, which allows us to better understand whether a particular therapeutic is helpful.</p><p>For mild to moderate treatment resistant depression, our general approach is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with treatment resistant depression, we suggest augmentation as initial treatment and switching antidepressants (ie, monotherapy with a new antidepressant) as next step treatment. However, it is reasonable to reverse the order of these treatment strategies, especially for patients who want to avoid medication side effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment resistant patients who cannot tolerate an adequate dose of the initial antidepressant should switch antidepressants as initial treatment.</p><p/><p>For treatment resistant depression, some evidence suggests that the benefit of augmentation is modestly superior to switching antidepressants. However, other studies suggest that the benefits of augmentation and switching are comparable. (See <a href=\"#H904025\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of augmentation compared with switching'</a> below.)</p><p>Given that the evidence does not clearly favor augmentation over switching antidepressants, shared decision making with patients is important. Patients who partially benefit from the initial antidepressant and experience few adverse effects prefer adjunctive pharmacotherapy rather than switching [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-of-resistant-depression/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Conversely, patients who experience less symptomatic improvement and more side effects with the antidepressant prescribed at first presentation prefer switching antidepressants. Implementation of augmentation and switching are discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a href=\"#H2345508222\" class=\"local\">'Augmentation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8047894\" class=\"local\">'Switching antidepressants'</a> below.) </p><p>For patients with treatment resistant depression who augment antidepressants with a second drug and do not respond, it is not clear how many trials of add-on therapy that clinicians should administer before switching the antidepressant. We generally provide one to three courses of augmentation before switching the antidepressant. When switching the antidepressant, we typically continue the current adjunctive drug, based upon the principle of making only one change at a time.</p><p>Switching antidepressants is often preferable to augmentation for treatment resistant depression because adherence may be better with monotherapy than combination treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-of-resistant-depression/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In addition, monotherapy may cost less and presents fewer risks of drug interactions in patients taking medications for other conditions. </p><p>Although monotherapy may cause fewer adverse effects than multidrug regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-of-resistant-depression/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], this is not necessarily the case. The prospective Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study compared side effects in 269 treatment resistant patients who selected switching (from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>) as next step treatment, and 269 patients who selected citalopram augmentation (with bupropion or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buspirone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buspirone</a>); the two groups were matched using propensity scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-of-resistant-depression/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The overall incidence of distressing side effects for each group was similar. &#160; </p><p>For patients with treatment resistant depression who switch antidepressants and do not respond, it is not clear how many trials of antidepressant monotherapy that clinicians should administer before augmenting the antidepressant with a second treatment. We generally provide one to three courses of next step antidepressant monotherapy before using augmentation.</p><p>An alternative to switching antidepressants or augmenting the antidepressant with a second medication is to switch from pharmacotherapy to psychotherapy (eg, cognitive-behavioral therapy [CBT]), or retain the initial antidepressant and add psychotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-of-resistant-depression/abstract/13,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,31,32</a>]. In addition, it is reasonable to augment with both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. However, psychotherapy is often not available, and many patients decline it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-of-resistant-depression/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

A 12-week, open-label, randomized trial enrolled patients (n = 1522; 85 percent male) with unipolar major depression who remained severely depressed despite treatment with at least one course of antidepressant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-of-resistant-depression/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Nearly half of the patients had comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder, and most patients were currently receiving psychotherapy.

Patients who remitted during acute treatment (n = 396) received continuation treatment for another 24 weeks; relapse at week 36 was comparable for the three treatment groups (roughly 25 percent of patients in each group). &#160; &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adverse effects that occurred more often in the augment-aripiprazole group, compared with the other two groups, included akathisia, somnolence, and weight gain, as well as multiple abnormal laboratory tests.

A meta-analysis of 25 randomized trials compared tricyclics with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in 1377 hospitalized patients who were not selected for treatment resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/unipolar-depression-in-adults-treatment-of-resistant-depression/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. Although tricyclics were more efficacious than SSRIs, the difference was small, and heterogeneity across studies was significant.
