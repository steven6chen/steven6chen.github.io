Hemodialysis patients are vulnerable to contaminants in the water used to prepare concentrate and dialysis fluid or in water used for reprocessing dialyzers. This vulnerability is due to the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodialysis patients are exposed to extremely large volumes of water. The estimated water intake of a healthy individual is 2 L per day or 14 L per week. By comparison, during a single dialysis treatment lasting four hours, performed at a dialysis fluid flow rate of 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> a hemodialysis patient is exposed to 192 L of water or to 576 L per week, if treated three times weekly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodialysis patients have inadequate barriers to waterborne contaminants. In healthy individuals who are not on dialysis, the gastrointestinal tract separates blood from contaminants in the water. By comparison, the barrier between blood and water in hemodialysis patients is the membrane within the hemodialyzer through which transfer of contaminants is limited only by the size of the contaminant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodialysis patients are unable to renally excrete any contaminants taken up from the dialysate.</p><p/><p>No municipal water can be considered safe for use in hemodialysis applications in the absence of a treatment system. All dialysis facilities therefore require an appropriately designed and correctly maintained water treatment system to safeguard patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the maintenance and monitoring of the various water treatment devices used for hemodialysis applications. The different waterborne contaminants to which hemodialysis patients are exposed and the available water treatment systems are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contaminants in water used for hemodialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Water purification systems in hemodialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPONENTS OF QUALITY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All dialysis units should have a facility-specific quality management program for the water treatment plant and the water distribution system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The quality management program should include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance practices</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Structured monitoring program</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detailed written description of actions to be taken in the event that deviations from normal operation are observed, with clearly delineated lines of responsibility</p><p/><p>Ensuring that water quality is maintained over an extended period begins with the correct initial installation and verification of the treatment and distribution systems. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Water purification systems in hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Obtaining a water treatment system'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Water purification systems in hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Assembling a water treatment system'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis#H1514575171\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Water purification systems in hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Installing a water treatment system and verifying its performance'</a>.)</p><p>Once a water treatment system is installed and shown to be operating properly, a monitoring system should be in place to ensure that performance is maintained, procedures are followed, water quality is routinely assessed, and the requirements of appropriate standards are achieved (see <a href=\"#H466819927\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below). Results should be charted to allow trend analysis of the performance of equipment and overall water quality. Appropriate action limits should be established, together with the action to be taken when abnormal test results are obtained, to ensure continuing compliance with water quality standards. (See <a href=\"#H466820224\" class=\"local\">'Action in response to detected problems'</a> below.)</p><p>The quality management program should be carried out by appropriately trained personnel. The medical director of the facility should provide regular oversight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H466819921\"><span class=\"h1\">MAINTENANCE PRACTICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a water treatment system is initially installed or when the system is modified, each stage of the installation, performance validation, and operational qualification should be agreed and documented in advance and signed off by the <span class=\"nowrap\">manufacturer/installer</span> and the medical director of the facility.</p><p>Once the water treatment system and its performance have been verified, the maintenance and monitoring schedule for the water treatment plant generally becomes the sole responsibility of the hemodialysis facility. To assist, appropriate maintenance practices should be provided by the vendor of a new system when it is installed or when an existing system is modified. It is the responsibility of the hemodialysis facility to ensure that such maintenance practices are made part of the quality management program and are correctly implemented.</p><p>Major maintenance tasks, such as the replacement of deionizers and carbon beds, are best performed by appropriately trained external contractors or by the manufacturer. Day-to-day maintenance can be undertaken by dialysis facility staff members, provided that they have received appropriate training. Such training should be specific to the functions performed, and competence with procedures should be regularly assessed and documented. Periodic audits of the operator&rsquo;s compliance with procedures should be undertaken and documented, and there should be an ongoing training program to maintain the knowledge and skills of dialysis facility staff involved in the monitoring process.</p><p>Maintenance practices for individual components of the water treatment system are based on the manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions for use but may require local modification. For example, the frequency with which it is necessary to clean reverse osmosis membranes is dependent upon the quality of the feed water and is facility specific. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Water purification systems in hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Reverse osmosis'</a>.)</p><p>If monitoring suggests that the performance of the system or of any individual system component is inferior to specification, reassessment and, if necessary, modification of the system or of relevant maintenance practices should ensue. This process should continue until the monitoring demonstrates restoration of adequate performance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H466820577\"><span class=\"h1\">DISINFECTION OF WATER DISTRIBUTION PIPING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine disinfection of the water distribution system piping is a critical maintenance practice designed to prevent the formation of bacterial biofilm on the interior surfaces. The water distribution piping is vulnerable to the formation of biofilm because bacteriostatic agents that are present in feed water (and which generally inhibit bacterial proliferation and biofilm formation) are removed by the water purification system within the dialysis facility (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Water purification systems in hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Carbon filtration'</a>). Once established, biofilm is very difficult to remove. Furthermore, dispersal of cells from an existing biofilm colony is an essential stage of the biofilm life cycle. Dispersal enables biofilms to spread and colonize new surfaces.</p><p>Control of bacterial proliferation and biofilm formation is best achieved by routine disinfection. The frequency of disinfection will vary with the design of the system and the extent to which biofilm has already formed in existing systems. Disinfection schedules should be designed to prevent bacterial proliferation, rather than to eliminate bacteria once they have proliferated to an unacceptable level. Levels of bacteria and endotoxins should be monitored to demonstrate that the disinfection program is effective, rather than to indicate when disinfection should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Microbial contaminant level measurements'</a> below.)</p><p>Traditionally, disinfection has been performed using sodium hypochlorite (bleach) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peracetic <span class=\"nowrap\">acid/hydrogen</span> peroxide. These agents are more effective if the pipes are first treated with a descaling agent. However, frequent disinfection with chemical agents can be difficult because of the lengthy period of rinsing required to remove residual disinfection from a distribution system. Disinfection with hot water or ozonated water is a preferred alternative since these methods leave no chemical residues (hot water) or residues with a short half-life (ozone) and thus allow more frequent disinfection. Monthly microbiologic monitoring of water treatment systems in a range of standalone facilities in Holland that used proactive hot water sanitization revealed that the product water had &lt;0.1 colony-forming units <span class=\"nowrap\">(CFU)/mL</span> in 567 of 685 samples (82.8 percent) and &lt;0.03 endotoxin units <span class=\"nowrap\">(EU)/mL</span> in 653 of 663 samples (98.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In cases where biofilm has formed and is resistant to disinfection, cleaning the system with 2 to 3 percent citric acid before disinfection may help in biofilm removal, provided the materials of the system are compatible with such chemical exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>However, in some cases, complete or partial replacement of a distribution system might be the only way to remove biofilm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H466819927\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A monitoring system should be in place to ensure that performance is maintained, procedures are followed, water quality is routinely assessed, and the requirements of appropriate standards are achieved. For standalone dialysis facilities and hospital-based facilities, the appropriate monitoring frequency is established using data collected during the initial validation process of the system that follows its installation. The monitoring of chemical parameters depends on the quality of the water entering the treatment system and the results of the validation process. Monitoring of microbiologic contaminant levels is determined by the frequency of disinfection and the results of the validation process. International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 23500 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] provides guidance on this aspect of maintaining water quality.</p><p>The frequency of monitoring chemical and microbiologic contaminant levels in the feed and the product water of home hemodialysis patients is less than in standalone or hospital-based facilities. The sampling should be performed every six months or after changes to the water treatment system. If the interval between sample testing exceeds six months, documentation should be in place to demonstrate that the sampling schedule used has been based on trend analysis.</p><p>Both the performance of the water treatment plant and the quality of the feed water should be monitored. The ability of a water treatment system to provide high-quality product water (ie, water that meets applicable standards) can change with variations in quality of the municipal water supply. Municipal water supply quality fluctuates seasonally. Municipal water supply may also fluctuate after work on the distribution infrastructure and when there are changes in water abstraction practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Users should also be aware of changes in water treatment practices that may be introduced without prior notification by the supplier. For example, many water suppliers in the United States increased the pH of the water supply in response to an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirement to decrease lead and copper concentrations in drinking water. This increase in pH can decrease the removal of chloramine by granular-activated carbon.</p><p>Specific challenges in monitoring the quality of feed water can exist depending on where that water is used, for example, in a standalone dialysis facility, a dialysis facility within a hospital, or in a patient&rsquo;s home. The water supply for a standalone facility is generally via a direct water main connection. Water supplied to a hospital-based dialysis facility (or intensive care unit where dialysis is performed at the bedside) is usually via the hospital water supply system. Patients who perform home hemodialysis may use either the municipal water supply or well water.</p><p>Regardless of the setting, all dialysis facilities should establish a robust system of communication with their municipal water suppliers. Facilities should request that they be notified in advance of any major changes in the supplier&rsquo;s water treatment practices, repair work to the municipal water distribution system supplying the dialysis facility, or changes in municipal water quality, such as might occur with seasonal algae blooms.</p><p>Additionally, in the hospital setting, it is essential that there be good communication between the dialysis facility and the entities that supply the feed water. This is because practices that are instituted to protect the hospital water supply may be harmful to dialysis patients. As an example, there have been several incidents in which hydrogen peroxide that was added to the hospital water supply to control <em>Legionella</em> caused the development of methemoglobinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>] or hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>For patients treated in the home, the feed-water supply is usually from a direct water main connection. However, in rural settings, the feed water may be from a private well. In such a setting, close attention should be paid to the quality of the feed water since well water is subject to seasonal changes and contamination from a variety of other sources such as agricultural waste, chemicals used in hydrocarbon extraction, septic tanks, or underground fuel storage tank seepage. Due to its nature, well water may be subject to a higher rate of failure in terms of microbiologic and chemical quality. A public health study of pathogens in US groundwater supplies reported results of sampling of 244 public water-supply wells prior to any treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Approximately 50 percent of wells initially considered more vulnerable to contamination and 40 percent of wells considered less vulnerable were positive for one or more fecal indicators (total coliform bacteria, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, enterococci, viruses infecting coliform bacteria, and human viruses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In contrast to standalone and hospital-based facilities, home hemodialysis is performed with a limited amount of technical support. The patient or their care partner should be trained to perform basic monitoring of the water treatment infrastructure and provided with a log sheet to record all measures of water treatment system performance. Measurements should be made after the water treatment system has been operating for at least 15 minutes and before dialysis is initiated. To ensure that dialysis is not undertaken with suboptimal water quality, the performance of the reverse osmosis system should be monitored prior to each treatment by checking the product water conductivity and percent rejection. If the reverse osmosis system is found to be operating outside its acceptable range, the dialysis center responsible for the patient should be notified and treatment delayed&nbsp;until the problem&nbsp;has been rectified. If the water treatment system includes a standalone softener, the water hardness should be monitored prior to each treatment using a sample obtained through a labeled sample port located between the softener and the reverse osmosis system. For hardness tests requiring color differentiation, the person performing the analysis should be able to distinguish between the colors of blue, purple, and red. If the person cannot differentiate these colors, an automated meter should be used. Results should be recorded on the log sheet and reviewed as part of the maintenance and service of the home hemodialysis system.</p><p>Ultimately, the medical director of the center supervising the care of a home dialysis patient is responsible for ensuring appropriate measures are in place to ensure the quality of the water and dialysis fluid used by that patient and that those measures are routinely implemented.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H466820349\"><span class=\"h2\">Methods of monitoring water quality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monitoring of water can be divided into two categories: on-line monitoring, which is comprised of manual or automated processes and confined primarily to physical parameters (such as flow rate, pressure, conductivity, and temperature), and off-line monitoring, which is comprised of the measurement of chemical and microbiologic contaminant concentrations. Both the purified water that is produced and the feed water should be monitored. Water samples should be obtained from the appropriate location as detailed in the operational policies and procedures for the dialysis facility. The operational policies and procedures should also include instructions on taking and handling the samples up to the time of testing.</p><p>Data collected from monitoring should be charted to allow trend analysis of equipment performance. Data should be regularly reviewed by the medical director.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53101733\"><span class=\"h3\">On-line measurements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical parameters such as flow rate, pressure, and temperature are measured with standard gauges and meters and their outputs recorded manually. Conductivity (or resistivity) is used as a convenient on-line measure of the total concentration of ionized species in the water. Meters used for such measurements must be temperature compensated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53101860\"><span class=\"h3\">Off-line measurements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Levels of chemical and microbiologic contaminants are determined on samples of water collected at various points throughout the water treatment and distribution system.</p><p>To ensure that samples are representative of conditions during routine operation, the system should have been in continuous operation for at least 20 to 30 minutes before any sample is taken. All sampling points should provide direct access to the water stream to be sampled. Sampling points should not be placed in areas of stagnant flow or at the end of a long length of dead-end tubing. Prior to sampling from such points, liquid should be allowed to flow from the sampling point for at least 30 seconds before sampling, and, if the sample is for microbiologic quantification, aseptic collection techniques should be used.</p><p>Specific methods for measuring chemical or microbial contaminants are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Chemical contaminant level measurements'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Microbial contaminant level measurements'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53101898\"><span class=\"h2\">Filters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Filters are monitored for evidence of fouling by measuring the pressures at the inlet and outlet of the filter (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Water purification systems in hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Filters'</a>). These pressures are used to calculate the pressure drop, or delta P, across the filter (delta P equals the pressure difference between the inlet pressure and outlet pressure). As particulate matter accumulates, the pressure difference increases. An increase in pressure difference above a predetermined value (which is generally provided by the filter manufacturer) indicates that the filter should be replaced or cleaned. Failure to replace or clean the filter can lead to a reduction in flow downstream of the filter, resulting in an inadequate pressure at the inlet of subsequent purification devices and a degradation of performance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53101905\"><span class=\"h2\">Softeners</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Softeners are monitored to ensure that they continue to remove calcium and magnesium ions (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Water purification systems in hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Softeners'</a>). Calcium and magnesium concentrations in the product water can be determined indirectly using a kit to measure the hardness of the water. Since softeners are often automatically regenerated at night when no dialysis is being performed, the hardness of the product water should be measured towards the end of the day to ensure that the softener has adequate capacity to remove calcium and magnesium ions throughout its operating cycle. In general, the hardness of product water from a softener should not exceed 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a>. Values above this level should prompt an evaluation of the softener for loss of resin, fouling of the resin by iron, an inadequate regeneration cycle, or inadequate capacity due to an increase in water throughput.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53101911\"><span class=\"h2\">Carbon media</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carbon beds are monitored to detect exhaustion of their capacity to remove chloramine and total chlorine (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Water purification systems in hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Carbon filtration'</a>). Although carbon can remove a wide range of organic contaminants by adsorption, removal of chloramine takes place via an oxidation-reduction reaction at active sites on the carbon surface. Over time, access to these active sites is diminished by adsorption of soluble organic molecules and by trapping of suspended material present in the water. Eventually, chloramine molecules reach the outlet of the bed without finding an active site. This phenomenon is known as breakthrough.</p><p>Patients are protected from exposure to chloramine resulting from breakthrough by placing two carbon beds in series and monitoring the chloramine concentration after the first bed. When exchangeable carbon beds are used, the first bed is discarded when breakthrough is detected, the second bed is moved into the first position, and a new bed is installed in the second position. When permanent carbon beds are used, it is often simpler to replace the carbon in both beds.</p><p>Fouling of a carbon bed occurs when suspended matter in the water is trapped in the bed by depth filtration. This trapped material increases the resistance to flow through the bed and reduces the feed pressure to the next element in the purification cascade. Channeling occurs when the packing of carbon particles in a bed becomes nonuniform. Under such conditions, open passages form in the bed. Water passes through these channels, decreasing contact between the water and the carbon particles and thereby reducing the ability of the bed to remove contaminants. Monitoring the pressure drop between the inlet and outlet of a carbon bed provides information on fouling (an increase in pressure drop at a constant flow rate) or channeling (a decrease in pressure drop at a constant flow rate). If either condition is detected, backflushing may prolong bed life. However, backflushing does not regenerate exhausted bed capacity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53101938\"><span class=\"h2\">Deionizers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deionizers are monitored to ensure product water quality and to indicate when new resin beds are needed (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Water purification systems in hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Deionization'</a>). Because undetected failure of a deionizer can be extremely hazardous to patients, the resistivity of the product water must be monitored continuously with a temperature-compensated meter. The meter should be coupled to an alarm system that is audible in the patient treatment area and that diverts product water to drain if the resistivity falls <strong>below</strong> 1 megaohm [M&Omega;]&middot;cm (1 micro Siemens <span class=\"nowrap\">(S)/cm</span> or 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mS/m)</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53101974\"><span class=\"h2\">Reverse osmosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reverse osmosis systems are monitored to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensure continued removal of contaminants at the desired level</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensure production of sufficient product water</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indicate when the membranes should be cleaned or replaced</p><p/><p>To facilitate such monitoring, samples are generally taken from multiple points (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63776\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63776 \">figure 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Water purification systems in hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Reverse osmosis'</a>). Measurements of conductivity and flow rate are used to calculate the percent solute rejection (a measure of contaminant removal) and the percent recovery of product water (a measure of membrane fouling) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F57198\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57198 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Reverse osmosis systems may be single pass, in which the waste or rejected water stream is discharged directly to drain, or configured so that an amount of the waste water stream is recycled into the feed-water stream. In the latter system, the absolute value of percent solute rejection depends upon the point at which the feed-water conductivity is measured. If the measurement is made before the point at which the recycled water enters the feed-water stream, the calculated solute rejection provides a measure of the overall performance of the reverse osmosis system. If the measurement is made after the point at which the recycled water enters the feed-water stream, the calculated solute rejection provides a measure of the performance of the reverse osmosis membranes, and the value may be slightly lower.</p><p>When the product-water flow rate or percent recovery of product water changes by some predetermined amount (typically 10 percent at constant temperature, pressure, and feed-water flow rate), the membrane modules should be cleaned using the manufacturer's recommended method. An increase in pressure drop of 10 percent should also prompt cleaning of the membranes. If cleaning fails to restore performance, the membrane modules might need to be replaced. The life of reverse osmosis membranes can be prolonged by pretreatment of the feed water. As an example, softening the feed water will help minimize fouling with calcium and magnesium salts. In addition, removal of chlorine by carbon can protect membranes from degradation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CHEMICAL CONTAMINANT LEVEL MEASUREMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most chemical contaminants can be determined off site. Measurements should be carried out by trained and accredited persons or in accredited laboratories, with records maintained within the dialysis unit. Suggested assay methods of testing for water contaminants have been published by national organizations such as the American Public Health Association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and also form part of methodologies detailed in national standards [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The assay used for each chemical contaminant must have a minimum detection level below the maximum allowable level for that contaminant.</p><p>Disinfectants are normally added to drinking water to ensure that the water meets applicable standards. Commonly used disinfectants are chlorine, chloramine, and chlorine dioxide. When water is distributed via complex networks such as those found within buildings, these can incorporate a storage tank to ensure adequate water supply and pressure at times of peak demand; biocides may be added locally to minimize the risk from <em>Legionella</em>.</p><p>The rationale for this is outlined in documents produced by the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-10/documents/drafttechlegionellaoct2015.pdf&amp;token=EcEyV24UTQrAXGg2vNNGNqe3pvfzKCedRJDjN3j3lUAXzyEvHOQAQdzzXCBk3U8k9v7Yg3POb4M8q5ERfojEXpQ34kElOItVrlHeVp0pfmM5XAUISeGWFiTOjhINmiCF&amp;TOPIC_ID=1900\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a> in the US and <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/priced/hsg274part2.pdf&amp;token=Ij0am49iIgRGCHqHa2kHyo52Ys33tOf8p95R2PMeO1iM4QYGPul2kfYVE6O2BrzEdHGcGl5fzZXyFCCOSGX9Ew==&amp;TOPIC_ID=1900\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">the Health and Safety Executive (HSE)</a> in the United Kingdom.</p><p>Chlorine dioxide and silver-stabilized hydrogen peroxide are commonly used for this purpose.

There is increasing use of chlorine dioxide to prevent growth of <em>Legionella</em> bacteria in hospital water systems. National, European, and international standards do not address the maximum permitted levels of chlorine dioxide or its breakdown products in dialysis water, as there is little information about their potential toxicity to hemodialysis patients. These compounds have low molecular weights, and their removal by carbon is critically dependent upon the type of carbon used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Colorimetric methods can be used to quantify chlorine dioxide at low levels.

Alternately, a selective fluorescence method based on the oxidation of rhodamine dyes by chlorine dioxide in an ammonia-ammonium chloride buffered solution may be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>When chlorine dioxide is used as a sterilant, residual chlorine dioxide and a range of breakdown products, namely chlorite, chlorate, and organic disinfection byproducts (DBPs), may be present.

Such transfer has been implicated in cytokine induction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and, thus, could potentially contribute to the microinflammatory state present in dialysis patients. However, with the exception of one retrospective cohort study from Japan showing that lower endotoxin levels in dialysis fluid were associated with a decreased risk for all-cause mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], there has been no systematic study of the long-term effects or sequelae of further reducing microbial contaminant levels (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contaminants in water used for hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Bacterial contaminants'</a>). Water that achieves the standard for dialysis applications is also the starting point in the production of ultrapure dialysis fluid or for on-line infusion fluid used in hemodiafiltration.

A brief overview is provided below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53102686\"><span class=\"h2\">Sample collection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Samples should be collected into sterile, pyrogen-free containers and analyzed as soon as possible after collection. If samples cannot be analyzed within four hours of collection or are sent to an off-site laboratory, the sample should be refrigerated (not frozen) or packed on ice in an insulated container suitable for shipping. For samples analyzed off site, the laboratory's instructions for shipping must be followed to ensure that analysis is performed within 24 hours of the sample being taken.</p><p>The storage and handling of samples for endotoxin analysis is dependent upon the measurement technique. Individual laboratories' instructions for sample handling and storage must be followed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53102701\"><span class=\"h2\">Analytical methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of common clinical laboratory methods intended for bloodborne bacteria, commercial water test kits, or dip samplers are not recommended, due to their lack of sensitivity and specificity for waterborne bacteria. This is important because water used for hemodialysis purposes generally has low bacterial levels. Specific, validated, and sensitive analytical methods of sample plating and sample culture must be used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53102734\"><span class=\"h3\">Sample plating</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following methods are considered suitable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53102749\"><span class=\"h4\">Membrane filtration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Membrane filtration is filtration of the sample through a membrane filter with pore diameter 0.45 micrometer or less. Membrane filtration is used when the sample needs to be concentrated in order to detect low levels of contamination (usually &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">CFU/mL)</span>. The volume to be filtered should be determined by the suspected level of contamination and should be between 10 mL and 1000 mL. Because the membrane filter technique might not be readily available in clinical laboratories, the spread plate assay or the pour plate assay can be used as alternatives for water and standard dialysis fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H53102772\" class=\"local\">'Spread plate technique'</a> below and <a href=\"#H53102795\" class=\"local\">'Pour plate technique'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53102772\"><span class=\"h4\">Spread plate technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>0.1 to 0.3 mL of a sample is spread over the surface of a culture-containing Petri dish (typically 90 mm in diameter). The detection limit of this technique is 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">CFU/mL</span> when 0.2 mL of sample is used as the inoculum. If the spread plate technique is used, the sample must not be applied with a calibrated loop. Calibrated loops are commonly used in clinical laboratories for culturing body fluids and apply a very small volume (typically 0.001 to 0.01 mL) to the culture plate. As a result, the minimum sensitivity of the calibrated loop technique is on the order of 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">CFU/mL</span>. This sensitivity is unacceptable when the maximum allowable level of bacteria is 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">CFU/mL</span> and the action level is 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">CFU/mL</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53102795\"><span class=\"h4\">Pour plate technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A sample (typically 1 mL) is placed in a Petri dish, and 15 to 20 mL of molten medium is added. The sample and medium are mixed carefully by gentle rotation and allowed to set. The time between addition of the sample and addition of the molten medium should not exceed 15 minutes. The plate is inverted and incubated. If 1 mL of sample is used, the detection limit of this technique is 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">CFU/mL</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53102802\"><span class=\"h3\">Sample culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The culture medium, incubation temperature, and incubation time have been optimized for the culture of organisms in dialysis water.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Culture medium &ndash; A low-nutrient agar, such as Tryptone Glucose Extract Agar (TGEA) or Reasoner&rsquo;s Agar 2A, should be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

A long incubation time allows the growth of species that are better adapted for growth at a higher temperature <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> on richer media.</p><p/><p>These conditions have been shown to give good recovery for most environmental bacteria found in purified water. Other test methods may also be used, provided that such methods have been appropriately validated and compared with the cited methods. The United States standard for dialysis water quality (American National Standards Institute <span class=\"nowrap\">[ANSI]/Association</span> for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation [AAMI] 13959:2014) allows the use of Trypticase soy agar or Standard Methods Agar incubated for 48 hours at 35&deg;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These culturing conditions have not yet been included in the equivalent International Standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], because of an ongoing debate regarding their validation and equivalence to the other conditions listed above.</p><p>The standard test for determining endotoxin concentrations is the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay. A number of different techniques are in use, and endotoxin testing should be performed by fully trained personnel. It is important to use sample containers, validated for storage of samples for endotoxin determination. Such containers are usually specified by the testing laboratory or the manufacturer of the LAL assay kit.</p><p>Culture results obtained using the methods outlined are only a relative indicator of the bioburden in water and do not provide a measure of the absolute bacterial burden. With new systems, it is important to recognize that biofilm takes some time to form and mature. Therefore, little or no growth might be seen in fluid samples taken during the first month of operation, even if no disinfection is performed.</p><p>Algae, mold, and fungi may also be present in water distribution systems; however, no limits are specified in respect of water used for hemodialysis applications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H466820224\"><span class=\"h1\">ACTION IN RESPONSE TO DETECTED PROBLEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dialysis units should have written policies that describe actions to be taken when an abnormality is detected in the water treatment or distribution system. Appropriate action limits should be established for each measured parameter.</p><p>Because failure of a water treatment system can lead to serious adverse events, personnel responsible for day-to-day operation of the water treatment system should be additionally trained to recognize system failures and have the authority to act immediately in the event of such failures. For example, a technician who observes the exhaustion of a deionizer must have the authority to order the cessation of all dialysis treatments until the exhausted deionizer is replaced. (A deionizer is a water purification process by which ion-exchange resins are used to remove ionic contaminants from water; deionizer performance must be monitored closely since, once the resins are exhausted, ions previously removed are re-released back into the water, which can cause significant toxicity to patients). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=water-purification-systems-in-hemodialysis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Water purification systems in hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Deionization'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">MAINTENANCE AND MONITORING SCHEDULES AND DOCUMENTAION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Water treatment systems require regular supervision, maintenance, and servicing. Each water treatment system should have a log book with written records documenting every intervention, repair, servicing, or maintenance procedure. All servicing, maintenance, interventions, and changes to the water treatment system should be recorded.</p><p>Maintenance practices and monitoring schedules depend upon the design of the water treatment system and the quality of the feed water. Typical parameters to be monitored and the frequency of monitoring are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F95215\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95215 \">table 2</a>). Not every item listed is required in all dialysis facilities, since the water treatment system components used are dependent upon the quality of the feed water.</p><p>Routine monitoring should also be performed and documented to ensure ongoing compliance with the dialysis water quality requirements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F95216\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95216 \">table 3</a>). Trend analysis of monitoring data should be used to provide information on system performance, thus enabling a preventive rather than a reactive approach to system maintenance. The monitoring schedule should be based on the results of the system validation. Frequency of monitoring should also take into consideration the consequences of failure of a given purification process and the accumulated history of the performance of the water treatment and distribution system. For example, deionizers must be monitored continuously since the exhaustion of a deionizer may acutely expose patients to dangerously high concentrations of contaminants. In addition, the deionizer monitor must be connected to appropriate safety systems. Similarly, if the feed water contains chloramine, carbon beds must be monitored at least daily because of the risk of acute hemolysis in patients exposed to chloramine.</p><p>Parameters that are measured continuously on-line should be recorded daily. Such parameters include the water production rate, the percent rejection and product water recovery of a reverse osmosis unit, and pressures throughout the water treatment and distribution system.</p><p>The concentrations of chemical contaminants in the final product water should be determined when systems are newly installed or modified as part of installation verification. Analysis for chemical contaminants might also be necessary when changes in supply water or component performance, such as a decrease in reverse osmosis rejection rate, are detected. In the latter cases, it may be sufficient to analyze for a single contaminant, such as aluminum, rather than for all contaminants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F64883\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64883 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F95195\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95195 \">table 5</a>). The observation that parameters measured on-line remain stable over time provides some additional assurance that water quality is being maintained independent of the measurement of concentrations of individual contaminants. However, a complete analysis of all contaminants should be performed at least annually.</p><p>As noted above, levels of bacteria and endotoxin should be regularly monitored to validate the effectiveness of the disinfection procedure used to limit biofilm formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maintaining-water-quality-for-hemodialysis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] (see <a href=\"#H466820577\" class=\"local\">'Disinfection of water distribution piping'</a> above). Samples for surveillance cultures and endotoxin testing should be collected before the system is disinfected, which is when the highest levels of contamination are likely to be present. When a new system is installed or the integrity of an existing system is broken, frequent disinfection and monitoring should be performed until consistently low levels of bacteria are observed. The frequency of disinfection and monitoring may be decreased if the accumulated data consistently show low levels of contamination; however, at least monthly disinfection and monitoring is recommended.</p><p>With new systems, it is important to recognize that biofilm takes some time to form and mature. Therefore, little or no growth might be seen in fluid samples taken during the first month of operation, even if no disinfection is performed. For that reason, caution should be exercised in extending the disinfection interval based on culture results obtained during the first few months of operation of a new system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53102975\"><span class=\"h1\">MAINTAINING WATER QUALITY IN NONDIALYSIS UNIT SETTINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general considerations described in the previous sections of this topic are equally applicable to water treatment infrastructure used for the provision of water for dialysis in the intensive care unit or in the patient's home. In these settings, to ensure that dialysis is not undertaken with suboptimal water quality, prior to each treatment, the performance of the reverse osmosis system should be monitored and recorded by checking the product-water conductivity and percent rejection. In addition, monitoring of carbon media should be performed. Sampling for chemical and microbiologic quality should be as described previously. (See <a href=\"#H53101860\" class=\"local\">'Off-line measurements'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Microbial contaminant level measurements'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients undergoing home hemodialysis <span class=\"nowrap\">(and/or</span> helpers) should have received adequate training to perform the required monitoring; this training should be appropriately documented.</p><p>As in the dialysis facility, when any repairs or component replacements are made to water treatment equipment, the impact on water quality should be evaluated and a chemical analysis performed, if indicated. Feed-water quality needs to be checked at least every six months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10421440\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All dialysis units should have a facility-specific quality management program for the water treatment plant and the water distribution system.
