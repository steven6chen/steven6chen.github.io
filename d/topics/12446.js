They can result from blunt or penetrating mechanism. Pneumothoraces can arise from chest wall injury or from injuries to the lung, trachea, bronchi, or esophagus; hemothoraces arise from injury to the blood vessels of the chest wall, mediastinum, or hilum. Both injuries can be life threatening and frequently occur together. Tension pneumothoraces lead to collapse of the ipsilateral lung and prevent venous return to the heart (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-respiratory-distress-in-children#H13169123\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute respiratory distress in children&quot;, section on 'Tension pneumothorax'</a>). Hemothoraces can lead to overwhelming blood loss and cardiovascular collapse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H732356076\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with hemo- or pneumothorax often complain of chest pain and shortness of breath. Physical examination may be notable for tachypnea, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, crepitus in the neck <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chest, chest wall ecchymosis, diminished breath sounds on the affected side, paradoxical chest wall movement and hyperresonance to percussion.</p><p>In addition to the signs above, tension pneumothorax, when present, leads to marked hypotension, distended neck veins due to blockage of extrathoracic venous return, and may cause tracheal deviation away from the affected lung.</p><p>Children with large hemothoraces may also demonstrate signs of shock, including tachycardia, hypotension, narrowed pulse pressure, pallor, and poor perfusion. Examination of the chest may reveal dullness to percussion and diminished breath sounds on the affected side.</p><p>The diagnosis of pneumo- or hemothorax is suspected based upon clinical findings and is confirmed during treatment by evidence of decompression such as a rush of air when the pleural cavity is entered during chest tube placement, evacuation of blood <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> air when the chest tube is connected to suction via a closed drainage system, or air obtained during needle thoracostomy. Improvement in vital signs and examination findings after thoracostomy and decompression also supports the diagnosis. In stable pediatric patients, imaging (chest radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F115894\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef115894 \">image 1</a>) or bedside ultrasonography) also can provide the diagnosis. However, in unstable patients, imaging should <strong>not</strong> delay emergency chest tube placement or, in patients with tension pneumothorax who are in extremis, needle thoracostomy. (See <a href=\"#H4209881948\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p>A screening supine chest radiograph is routinely obtained in multiple trauma patients as part of the primary survey. Although highly specific for the presence of a pneumothorax, it lacks sensitivity for this critical diagnosis in the emergency department setting. In one retrospective observational study of 47 children with pneumothorax or hemothorax due to blunt trauma seen on computed tomography (CT) of the chest, supine radiography identified only 5 (11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. On the other hand, when performed by properly trained and experienced physicians, thoracic ultrasound in adults is an effective screening tool for pneumothorax and hemothorax, with higher sensitivity and similar specificity when compared with supine chest radiography. While there are few pediatric studies of lung ultrasound for pneumothorax in trauma, its excellent performance in neonatal studies suggests this modality is likely to be as useful in children as in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Bedside ultrasound cannot accurately quantify the size of the pneumothorax but can identify a hemothorax or pericardial effusion (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-of-pneumothorax#H26874124\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging of pneumothorax&quot;, section on 'Ultrasound'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-ultrasound-in-adults-with-abdominal-and-thoracic-trauma#H30174609\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency ultrasound in adults with abdominal and thoracic trauma&quot;, section on 'Pneumothorax and hemothorax'</a>.)</p><p>CT adds little to the emergency evaluation of pneumothorax or hemothorax unless there is suspicion for injury to a large blood vessel, and should <strong>not</strong> be routinely obtained for this indication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4209881948\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of tension pneumothorax requires emergency needle thoracentesis performed with a large bore angiocatheter, followed by definitive placement of a pigtail catheter or tube thoracostomy. Tube thoracostomy is indicated for patients with traumatic hemothorax. Pigtail catheter placement, rather than tube thoracostomy, may be appropriate for simple pneumothoraces without associated hemothorax. Evidence suggests the pigtail catheter provides similar efficacy with less pain than a thoracostomy tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>For tube thoracostomy, the appropriate size chest tube may be determined by the child's age <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> weight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81970\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81970 \">table 1</a>). The technique for performing the procedure is described separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F57330\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57330 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-management-of-thoracostomy-tubes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and management of thoracostomy tubes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Management of larger hemothoraces may also require blood transfusion. Blood should be available at the time of thoracostomy because placement of the tube can disrupt clots and lower pleural pressure that may result in increased bleeding. Blood drained from the pleura can also be collected and autotransfused. For bleeding that continues at a rate of greater than 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hr,</span> thoracotomy is usually indicated. The indications for emergency department thoracotomy in children with thoracic trauma is provided separately.

In children with blunt trauma, pulmonary contusions typically arise in the posterior lung from shear forces applied across a deformable chest wall. Clinical features may be subtle and include tachypnea, hypoxemia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respiratory distress. Physical examination findings of pulmonary contusion may include chest wall ecchymosis, rales, rhonchi, or decreased breath sounds, but the examination is frequently normal in affected children. Supine chest radiography should be performed for all children with suspected pulmonary contusion and all significantly injured children. The primary finding consists of nonanatomic areas of consolidation that are located in the region of impact (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F111549\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111549 \">image 2</a>). Associated injuries such as pneumothorax, hemothorax, or, less commonly, rib fractures may also be apparent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-contusion-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary contusion in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The management of pulmonary contusion is discussed separately.

In a large retrospective series describing truncal injuries in children, 2 percent of the injuries were pulmonary lacerations, with a mortality rate of 55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Pulmonary lacerations are caused by penetrating trauma, displaced rib fractures, deceleration forces, or sudden compression from a crush injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22329621\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tears in the parenchyma of the lung may cause bleeding, or less commonly, an air leak, resulting in hemothorax <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Patients typically present with hemoptysis, signs of respiratory distress, and hypotension. Patients with these findings warrant emergency placement of a chest tube and urgent consultation or referral to a surgeon with pediatric expertise for bronchoscopy. The diagnosis is suspected based upon the presence of a hemothorax and blood in the lower airway on bronchoscopy. Confirmation is made by intravenous contrast computed tomography of the chest in stable patients or at operation in unstable patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22329627\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial management focuses on evacuation of the pneumo- and hemothorax and blood transfusion to counter blood loss. (See <a href=\"#H4209881948\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p>Most pulmonary lacerations resolve with supportive care consisting of chest tube drainage and supplemental oxygen as needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Persistent bleeding, major air leak, air embolism, massive hemoptysis, or the development of superinfection with abscess formation are indications for surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TRAUMATIC ASPHYXIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traumatic asphyxia is a rare consequence of traumatic thoracic or abdominal compression that occurs in children because of the greater flexibility of their thoracic cages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Typically, a marked increase in intrathoracic pressure occurs as the result of direct compression of the chest from crushing injury, in conjunction with deep inspiration against a closed glottis. This increased pressure is transmitted from the right atrium directly through the valveless superior and inferior vena cava, causing rupture of venules and capillaries of the face and head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Thus, traumatic asphyxia has a much different mechanism and clinical presentation than strangulation at the neck.

Because children have flexible thoracic cages, they may have tracheobronchial injuries without chest wall injuries. Unlike adults, only 25 percent of children with these injuries also have rib fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A tracheobronchial injury should be clinically suspected if a persistent high volume air leak develops after thoracostomy tube placement to relieve a pneumothorax.</p><p>Radiographic signs that suggest major airway injury include air within soft tissues or surrounding a bronchus, pneumothorax, hyoid bone elevation (indicating tracheal transection), and obstruction of an air-filled bronchus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

All patients who have significant penetrating tracheal injury warrant esophagoscopy to evaluate for esophageal injury. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Esophageal injury'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients who have bronchial injuries usually require thoracotomy with bronchial resection and anastomosis, although some children with small tears have been successfully managed nonoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Children may have greater respiratory distress than adults because they have a tendency to swallow air when they are stressed, resulting in dilation of the herniated stomach in the setting of left-sided diaphragmatic injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Physical findings suggesting the diagnosis of diaphragmatic rupture include auscultation of bowel sounds in the chest, diminished breath sounds on the side of the injury, and scaphoid abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children/abstract/40,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,46</a>]. Children with diaphragmatic injuries may have no external signs of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Chest radiographs may demonstrate bowel gas or loops of intestine above the diaphragm, the presence of the tip of the nasogastric tube above the diaphragm, or elevated or obscured hemidiaphragm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children/abstract/44,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,47,48</a>]. Additional nonspecific findings include small mediastinal shifts, lower lobe atelectasis, unilateral pleural effusion, air-fluid levels in the basal lung fields, lower thoracic rib fractures, and pneumothorax or hemothorax. Computed tomography with contrast and upper and lower gastrointestinal series confirm the diagnosis.</p><p>The following characteristics of diaphragmatic injuries have been noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diaphragmatic injury classically occurs with a left-sided predominance because of the protective effect of the liver.

Nasogastric tube placement often is important to reduce stomach size and permit better lung expansion prior to operative repair. </p><p>Chest tube placement should be <strong>avoided</strong>. Herniated abdominal organs can be damaged when a tube thoracostomy is performed in the hemithorax of an undiagnosed diaphragmatic injury. Consequently, a finger should be inserted through the chest wall incision and the diaphragm palpated before the tube is placed, whenever diaphragmatic injury is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Most diaphragmatic defects require operative repair. However, this procedure may be deferred in children with multiple injuries until more urgent diagnostic and therapeutic measures are performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-intrathoracic-injuries-in-children/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thoracic trauma is a marker for severe injury because thoracic injury typically occurs as the result of forceful mechanisms that also cause serious associated injuries. The following injuries may occur as the result of blunt or penetrating thoracic injury in children:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Pneumo- and hemothorax</strong> &ndash; Pneumo- and hemothorax often occur together, and each may be life threatening. Physical examination typically demonstrates tachypnea, hypoxemia, respiratory distress, crepitus in the neck <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chest, chest wall ecchymosis, diminished breath sounds on the affected side, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyperresonance to percussion. In addition to these signs, tension pneumothorax, when present, leads to marked hypotension, distended neck veins, and tracheal deviation away from the affected lung. The diagnosis of pneumo- or hemothorax is suspected based upon clinical findings and is confirmed by evidence of decompression during chest tube placement or needle thoracostomy. In unstable patients, imaging should <strong>not</strong> delay emergency treatment. Stable pediatric patients may undergo imaging (chest radiograph or bedside ultrasonography) to confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H2156563502\" class=\"local\">'Pneumo- and hemothorax'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Pulmonary contusion</strong> &ndash; Pulmonary contusion is defined as pulmonary parenchymal damage with edema and hemorrhage, in the absence of a large pulmonary vessel laceration. Physical examination findings of pulmonary contusion may include chest wall ecchymosis, rales, rhonchi, or decreased breath sounds, but the examination is frequently normal in affected children. Chest radiography typically shows pulmonary consolidation in the region of impact (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F111549\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111549 \">image 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-contusion-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary contusion in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-contusion-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary contusion in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-contusion-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary contusion in children&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Pulmonary laceration</strong> &ndash; Tears in the parenchyma of the lung may cause bleeding, or less commonly, an air leak, resulting in hemothorax <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pneumothorax. Patients typically present with hemoptysis, signs of respiratory distress, and hypotension. Pulmonary laceration can cause exsanguinating hemorrhage, requiring transfusion, particularly after placement of tube thoracostomy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary laceration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Traumatic asphyxia</strong> &ndash; Traumatic asphyxia is a rare consequence of thoracic trauma that occurs in children because of the greater flexibility of their thoracic cages. Dramatic physical findings include conjunctival hemorrhages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F115578\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef115578 \">picture 1</a>), facial edema, and cyanosis. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Traumatic asphyxia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Blunt cardiac injury</strong> &ndash; Children with blunt cardiac injuries (BCI) may have arrhythmias, new murmurs, heart failure, or hypotension. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Blunt cardiac injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Traumatic aortic injury</strong> &ndash; Clinical manifestations of traumatic aortic injury include hypotension, diminished blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulses in lower extremities (as compared with upper extremities), or paraplegia. The diagnosis is also suggested by a widened mediastinum on chest radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F88625\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef88625 \">image 4</a>). Emergency consultation with a trauma or cardiothoracic surgeon with pediatric expertise is warranted for any child suspected of BAI based upon physical findings or screening chest radiograph. The approach to diagnosis and treatment of children with suspected blunt aortic injury (BAI) is similar to the approach in adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73037\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73037 \">algorithm 1</a>). Hemodynamically unstable patients should undergo emergency surgical or endovascular repair rather than additional imaging. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Traumatic aortic injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Esophageal injury</strong> &ndash; Esophageal injuries may be overlooked during the initial evaluation. The initial symptoms of esophageal rupture can be subtle and nonspecific. Pain, which may be retrosternal or radiate to the neck or shoulders, is often reported. Early signs of esophageal rupture include tachycardia, dyspnea, abdominal guarding, and subcutaneous emphysema. (See <a href=\"#H22330310\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>The diagnosis of esophageal injury can generally be made with esophagography <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> esophagoscopy. Children with esophageal perforation should receive fluid resuscitation and administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms followed by urgent surgical repair. (See <a href=\"#H22330310\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations and diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15617427\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Tracheobronchial injury</strong> &ndash; Children with stridor, subcutaneous emphysema, or a persistent air leak after tube thoracostomy may have tracheobronchial injury. Chest radiograph and chest computed tomography help to confirm the diagnosis. Patients with suspected tracheobronchial injury should be intubated in a controlled situation with bronchoscopic guidance, whenever possible. Surgical repair is usually required. (See <a href=\"#H22330462\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations and diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22330468\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Diaphragmatic injury</strong> &ndash; Diaphragmatic injury may not be recognized during the initial evaluation of children with thoracic or abdominal trauma. Chest radiographs may demonstrate bowel gas or loops of intestine above the diaphragm (usually on the left), the presence of the tip of the nasogastric tube above the diaphragm, or elevated or obscured hemidiaphragm. The initial management for patients with diaphragmatic injuries includes resuscitation and stabilization of associated injuries. Nasogastric tube placement often is important to reduce stomach size and permit better lung expansion prior to operative repair. Chest tube placement should be <strong>avoided</strong>.
