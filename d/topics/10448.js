Although nodal involvement does not alter the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113542\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113542 \">table 1</a>), it impacts treatment. It does alter the staging by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). For women with locally advanced disease (stages IB2 to IVA) for whom primary chemoradiation is planned, we obtain a positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/computed</span> tomography (CT) scan prior to treatment to evaluate the extent of disease, with particular attention to lymph node metastases to provide information to design radiation fields. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cervical cancer: Staging and evaluation of lymph nodes&quot;</a>.) </p><p>For women with suspected para-aortic node involvement based on CT scan, some experts proceed with a lymphadenectomy or a CT-guided biopsy for pathologic confirmation of nodal status. At other centers, F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the para-aortic nodes is sufficient evidence of nodal involvement, and further work-up is not performed. Regardless of whether pathologic confirmation is obtained, treatment is required if para-aortic node involvement is detected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cervical cancer: Staging and evaluation of lymph nodes&quot;, section on 'Surgical evaluation of lymph nodes'</a> and <a href=\"#H30045461\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of para-aortic nodes'</a> below.) </p><p>Patients with renal insufficiency should undergo imaging to determine whether the etiology is urinary tract obstruction (which is diagnostic of stage III disease) or intrinsic renal disease. Some experts obtain upper urinary tract imaging for all patients with more than a microscopic tumor. In our practice, we obtain non-contrast CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if a woman presents with an elevated serum creatinine.</p><p>Any urinary tract obstruction should be corrected prior to cancer treatment, especially in patients who are otherwise candidates for primary chemoradiation. In a retrospective study performed by the Gynecologic Oncology Group involving 539 women with stage III cervical cancer (44 percent of whom presented with hydronephrosis) treated with chemoradiation, women who received treatment for ureteral obstruction had a significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival (OS) than those in whom obstruction was not treated (PFS: median, 18 versus 10 months; OS: median, 34 versus 17 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

In a 2010 study of patients with stage IIB disease treated with primary surgery plus postoperative radiation therapy (RT, n = 34) or primary chemoradiation (n = 25), the rate of serious (grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4)</span> complications was doubled among those treated with primary <span class=\"nowrap\">surgery/RT</span> (26 versus 12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The benefit of chemoradiation for women with locally advanced cervical cancer rather than RT alone was demonstrated in a 2010 meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Single-agent cisplatin administered with RT achieves similar outcomes to cisplatin plus FU and has a better toxicity profile. This was demonstrated in a randomized trial of 155 women with stage IIB to IVA cervical cancer (without para-aortic node involvement) who were randomly assigned treatment with RT plus either cisplatin or cisplatin plus FU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

We prefer to treat these patients with weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> dosed at area under the curve (AUC) 2 rather than exposing patients to the nephrotoxic effects of cisplatin. However, decisions regarding the choice of agent to administer with RT should be based on patient and provider preferences.</p><p>It is important to note that patients who present with acute organ dysfunction secondary to locally advanced cervical cancer should be worked up for a potentially correctable etiology. For patients with advanced cervical cancer, this most often presents as acute renal failure due to tumor-related hydronephrosis. These patients may experience a normalization of renal function following a ureteral stent or nephrostomy tube placement. Following normalization of renal function, these patients should receive primary chemoradiation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>.

However, the data on single-agent carboplatin are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>].</p><p>As an example, in one prospective study, 51 patients with predominantly advanced disease (stage IIB or higher) were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> concurrently with RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Their outcomes were compared with historical controls comprised of 48 women treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> plus RT.

In a series of nine patients with an obstructive uropathy, chemoradiation was administered with weekly gemcitabine (300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>);</span> four patients underwent a percutaneous nephrostomy placement prior to chemoradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. All patients were able to complete treatment, although toxicities were common, including grade 3 neutropenia, dermatitis, proctitis, and colitis. Following treatment, all patients normalized their creatinine. With a median follow-up of 11 months, all patients were alive; two had evidence of recurrent disease.</p><p>Beyond these considerations, the limited data suggest that other agents commonly used in cervical cancer should <strong>not</strong> be administered as a component of primary chemoradiation. This includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FU: Single-agent FU should not be used in this setting; one randomized trial showed that chemoradiation with this agent was no better than RT alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Paclitaxel</a>: Concurrent weekly paclitaxel plus RT has only been evaluated in one trial, which enrolled women with either locally advanced or recurrent cervical cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Of 13 women with locally advanced disease, eight (62 percent) had a complete response. However, five (26 percent) experienced grade 3 small bowel toxicity, raising questions about whether treatment is feasible.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10523862\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most women, RT (in conjunction with chemotherapy) is delivered to the pelvis using external-beam RT. Cervical brachytherapy is also administered in an effort to maximize local control. Two issues that arise in the design of the RT field are the treatment of the para-aortic nodal region and timing of RT treatment. These are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1286394\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of brachytherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brachytherapy is the local application of radiation to the <span class=\"nowrap\">cervix/vagina</span>. It is an essential component of treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer and allows for a higher dose of RT to the cervix while sparing the surrounding normal tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1917207402\"><span class=\"h4\">Rationale</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of brachytherapy was shown in a 2013 study that included over 7000 women with stage IB2 to IVA cervical cancer identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Using a matched cohort analysis of patients treated between 2000 and 2009, the use of brachytherapy resulted in significantly higher rates of cancer-specific survival (64 versus 52 percent) and OS (58 versus 46 percent) at four years. Unfortunately, this study also reported a decreased utilization rate of brachytherapy between 1998 and 2009 from 83 to 58 percent, respectively. This decrease in use was seen regardless of stage and histologic type. These data highlight the importance of brachytherapy in the treatment of cervical cancer. Given the data of underutilization, we recommend that these patients be treated at centers where the expertise to perform brachytherapy is available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2368411943\"><span class=\"h4\">Timing and technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brachytherapy is initiated during external-beam RT once optimal tumor reduction is achieved. Adequate cervical regression typically occurs between two and five weeks of therapy depending on presenting tumor stage and size and response to therapy. It can be delivered with either a low dose rate (LDR), pulse dose rate (PDR), or high dose rate (HDR) system. The International Commission on Radiation Units defines LDR brachytherapy as 0.4 to 2 Gy per hour; PDR brachytherapy delivers doses using the HDR source but treating only 10 to 30 minutes at a time, whereas HDR brachytherapy is delivered at &gt;12 Gy per hour. HDR and LDR appear to have similar efficacy and late complications in the management of cervical carcinoma, as suggested by retrospective single-institution reports, randomized trials, and a meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer/abstract/20-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-26</a>]. LDR brachytherapy requires one or two insertions and can begin near or after the completion of EBRT. The number of HDR insertions is variable across institutions, but most commonly is given as three to six insertions. The dose delivered per brachytherapy procedure is adjusted to account for the total number of insertions.</p><p>Three techniques can be employed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracavitary brachytherapy &ndash; With intracavitary brachytherapy, a variety of applicators can be employed. These include the placement of an intrauterine tandem with vaginal ovoids, vaginal cylinders, or a vaginal ring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51083\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51083 \">picture 1</a>). The addition of the ovoids or ring to the tandem applicator provides a dose distribution that encompasses the at-risk paracervical tissues while providing a lower dose distribution to the bladder and rectum. In addition, dose to the bladder and rectum can be reduced further with the use of shielded ovoids and vigorous packing. The choice of applicator is governed by clinician preference and comfort level, as well as patient anatomical considerations. We prefer ovoids, when possible, due to improved dosimetry and dosing to the vaginal fornices and parametria. Vaginal cylinders are employed when distal vaginal disease is present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interstitial brachytherapy &ndash; With interstitial brachytherapy, needles are placed with a variety of freehanded and template-based techniques, at times with laparoscopic guidance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79505\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79505 \">picture 2</a>). The most common presentation necessitating the use of interstitial therapy is extensive vaginal involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PDR brachytherapy &ndash; PDR brachytherapy uses a single Iridium-192 source that is programmed to move through various dwell positions in placed applicators using remote afterloading technology. The movement of the source through the positions constitutes a single pulse, and the dose delivered per pulse; the time interval between pulses and the total pulse duration can be varied. PDR brachytherapy delivers a treatment in which the goal is to draw from the advantages of both HDR brachytherapy and traditional LDR brachytherapy.</p><p/><p>Applicator placement typically requires intravenous conscious sedation or general anesthesia for patient comfort. Once the applicators are in place, treatments were traditionally planned using orthogonal radiographs to define prescription and normal tissue points of interest, but this is changing to image-guided brachytherapy using modern imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51717\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51717 \">image 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2679532799\"><span class=\"h4\">Dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the most common brachytherapy planning methodology, the total dose is prescribed to point A, which represents the paracervical tissues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66135\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66135 \">figure 1</a>). The prescribed brachytherapy dose depends on tumor stage, initial disease bulk and response to pelvic radiation, ability to displace bladder and rectum, and use of LDR, HDR, or PDR technique. The total prescription dose to point A is 80 to 90 Gy LDR equivalent, depending on tumor stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. A biologically effective dose is calculated and used when comparing HDR and LDR brachytherapy. The choice of dose for HDR also depends upon the number of fractions, for which there are multiple accepted regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

One prospective study including over 200 patients with advanced cervical cancer treated with chemoradiation followed by either IGABT or conventional brachytherapy found that IGABT was associated with an improvement in two-year locoregional control rate (70 versus 61 percent) and a reduction of grade 3 to 4 morbidity (1 versus 14 percent) when compared with conventional brachytherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].
