In most cases, subclavian steal is asymptomatic (ie, subclavian steal phenomenon), does not warrant invasive evaluation or treatment, and represents an appropriate physiological response to proximal arterial disease. Subclavian steal syndrome implies the presence of significant symptoms due to arterial insufficiency in the brain (ie, vertebrobasilar insufficiency) or upper extremity, which are supplied by the subclavian artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F51410\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51410 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The physiology, diagnosis, and treatment of subclavian steal will be reviewed here. General considerations for patients with symptoms of vertebrobasilar ischemia are discussed in detail elsewhere.

As a result, blood flows from the contralateral vertebral artery to the basilar artery and may flow in a retrograde direction down the ipsilateral vertebral artery, away from the brainstem (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F62622\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62622 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Reversed vertebral artery flow, although it may have deleterious neurologic effects, serves as an important collateral artery for the arm in this setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Coronary-subclavian steal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A coronary-subclavian steal phenomenon has been described in patients who have undergone prior coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) using the internal mammary artery (IMA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. The prevalence of subclavian artery stenosis is 2.5 to 4.5 percent in patients referred for coronary artery bypass grafting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In the presence of a hemodynamically significant subclavian artery stenosis proximal to the origin of the ipsilateral IMA, flow through the internal mammary artery may reverse and &quot;steal&quot; flow from the coronary circulation during upper extremity exercise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76733\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76733 \">figure 3</a>). Coronary and graft angiography will demonstrate retrograde flow in the involved IMA during selective catheterization of the grafted coronary artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Simultaneous coronary and cerebrovascular ischemia have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>]. Identification of a significant subclavian artery stenosis prior to CABG can prevent this important problem. Those patients with a high-grade subclavian artery stenosis should be treated (percutaneously or surgically) prior to CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. For patients with symptomatic subclavian lesions who require coronary artery bypass, no differences were seen for complications, mortality, or symptom recurrence, using a combined or staged approach to revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">incidence/prevalence</span> of subclavian steal syndrome is not well defined. Among individuals with documented peripheral artery disease, the prevalence of upper extremity atherosclerotic disease is much lower compared with lower extremities. Approximately 30 percent of such patients will have subclavian artery stenosis; however, only a minority develop symptoms, predominantly because of the extensive collateral network of vessels around the shoulder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66933\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66933 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-upper-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of upper extremity peripheral artery disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In a large study of extracranial arterial disease, the incidence of <span class=\"nowrap\">subclavian/innominate</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">stenosis/occlusion</span> was 17 percent, but only 2.5 percent fulfilled the criteria for subclavian steal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A later study identified subclavian <span class=\"nowrap\">stenosis/occlusion</span> in 432 of 7881 patients presenting for ultrasound exam of the extracranial neck vessels; among these, 38 (8.8 percent) experienced symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Therefore, subclavian steal syndrome occurs in only a minority of patients with subclavian stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

The risk factors associated with atherosclerosis are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of established risk factors for cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Males are more commonly affected compared with females. Subclavian stenosis and therefore subclavian steal occurs more commonly on the left side (&gt;75 percent), possibly due to a more acute origin of the left subclavian artery, resulting in accelerated atherosclerosis from increased turbulence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/4,17,19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,17,19-22</a>]. </p><p>Other conditions that increase the risk for subclavian stenosis that may lead to subclavian steal include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Takayasu arteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The site of arterial compression in thoracic outlet syndrome is most often distal to the origin of the vertebral artery. Therefore, the potential for symptomatic steal is low. However, these patients can have posterior circulation strokes due to retrograde propagation of thrombus. Athletes, such as baseball pitchers, cricket bowlers, and swimmers, are the most likely to be affected due to neurovascular compression as the subclavian artery crosses over the first rib.

In many patients, subclavian artery occlusive disease is found incidentally by noting a blood pressure discrepancy between arm pressures or on ultrasound testing of patients with carotid or coronary artery disease. A careful history and physical examination may identify subtle findings. For the majority of patients, the finding of &quot;angiographic steal&quot; is clinically insignificant and is not associated with an increased risk of vertebrobasilar ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/17,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,30</a>]. </p><p>A steal phenomenon is apparent on duplex scanning in approximately 6 percent of patients with asymptomatic neck bruits, but in one series, none of the patients developed symptoms during a two-year follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Even when reversed flow occurs in the vertebral artery, antegrade basilar arterial flow persists and may even be increased.</p><p>In one prospective study, 500 patients with asymptomatic neck bruits were followed over a four-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Of these patients, 9 percent had severe subclavian stenosis, and over one-half of these patients (64 percent) had a steal phenomenon. None of the patients had symptoms as a result of arm exercise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3365922328\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptomatic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When symptoms occur, they are most often due to arm ischemia, but this is uncommon as well. Symptoms of vertebrobasilar ischemia are also uncommon and tend to develop only when there are concurrent cerebrovascular lesions. Anomalies of the circle of Willis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F51410\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51410 \">figure 1</a>), the most important collateral route in the cerebrovascular circulation, occur with increased frequency in patients with symptomatic subclavian steal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Upper extremity ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms, when they occur, are due mainly to ischemia of the ipsilateral upper extremity. Exercise-induced arm pain, fatigue, coolness, paresthesias, or numbness occurs in approximately one-third of patients, but ischemic and trophic changes are rare. A large pressure difference (&gt;40 mmHg) between the arms is more commonly associated with symptoms and the need for intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Ischemic symptoms may also result from embolism of atherosclerotic or thrombotic debris from the subclavian lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1213695048\"><span class=\"h4\">Neurologic symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less often, neurologic symptoms can be caused by vertebrobasilar ischemia of the brainstem. </p><p>However, whether the steal phenomenon is the principal cause of cerebral ischemic symptoms remains controversial.

The presence of collateral blood supply and the capacity to increase collateral flow may be the principal determinants of which patients develop neurologic symptoms in this setting. </p><p>Vertebral artery compression and neurologic symptoms can also occur with head movements, usually rotation of the face toward the opposite side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This association can usually be detected by a careful history. </p><p>Although patients with documented subclavian steal have a very low incidence of posterior circulation ischemic events, these patients are more likely to develop hemispheric ischemia due to concurrent progressive carotid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Collateral pathways are usually compromised in symptomatic patients, placing them at increased risk, principally from carotid territory cerebrovascular events. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of symptoms from carotid atherosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bilateral vertebral flow reversal may be associated with an increased risk of nonlateralizing cerebral ischemia. In one study, brainstem dysfunction from upper extremity exercise was seen only in patients with bilateral reversed flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, persistent retrograde flow in the basilar artery, with collateral blood supply from the internal carotid arteries, has been reported in a patient without any neurologic or upper extremity symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On examination, there is usually a difference in brachial systolic blood pressure between the affected and normal arm of at least 15 mmHg. In addition, simultaneous palpation of both radial artery pulses will usually disclose a decrease in amplitude and delay in arrival on the affected side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61635\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef61635 \">waveform 1</a>).</p><p>The carotid arteries should be carefully examined, using palpation and auscultation, for evidence of occlusive arterial disease. Auscultation over the suboccipital region for vertebral artery bruits should also be performed. It is important to examine the subclavian arteries in the supraclavicular fossa using palpation (pulse character and thrills) and auscultation for paraclavicular bruits.</p><p>Other parts of the physical examination should include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Performance of thoracic outlet maneuvers to exclude other causes of a subclavian stenosis.

Noninvasive imaging of the cerebrovascular and upper extremity arterial circulation demonstrates the lesion and appropriate physiology.

Duplex ultrasound is limited in the evaluation of the origin of the vertebral artery for evidence of occlusive disease due to its intrathoracic location and is extremely accurate for the assessment and identification of significant extracranial carotid artery occlusive disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-diagnosis-of-arterial-disease#H58544718\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive diagnosis of arterial disease&quot;, section on 'Ultrasound'</a>.)</p><p>When severe stenosis (&gt;80 percent narrowing) of the proximal subclavian artery is present, 65 percent of patients have permanent flow reversal in the ipsilateral vertebral artery, and 30 percent have intermittent flow reversal (ie, &quot;to and fro&quot; waveform pattern on duplex) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/18,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,36</a>].

To do this, a blood pressure cuff is applied to the ipsilateral extremity and inflated at least 20 mmHg above systolic pressure for three to four minutes. This produces ischemia and compensatory vasodilation distal to the cuff. After deflation of the cuff, blood flow will increase in the upper extremity, and for patients with an otherwise asymptomatic subclavian stenosis, reversal of blood flow in the ipsilateral vertebral artery may provoke symptoms. During these maneuvers, retrograde flow can be observed with the concomitant use of ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1599269568\"><span class=\"h3\">Transcranial Doppler</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When flow reversal of the vertebral artery is identified, some authors have suggested the use of transcranial Doppler (TCD) to evaluate the direction of flow in the basilar artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subclavian-steal-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Subclavian steal represents an appropriate physiological compensation to proximal subclavian artery disease. Subclavian steal syndrome refers to the presence of significant symptoms due to arterial insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hemodynamically significant stenosis proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery results in lower pressure in the distal subclavian artery. As a result, blood flows from the contralateral vertebral artery to the basilar artery, and blood may flow in a retrograde direction down the ipsilateral vertebral artery, away from the brainstem (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F62622\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62622 \">figure 2</a>). In patients with an internal mammary artery bypass graft to the heart, proximal ipsilateral stenosis relative to the graft may reverse and &quot;steal&quot; flow from the coronary circulation during upper extremity exercise (ie, coronary-subclavian steal syndrome) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76733\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76733 \">figure 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition and physiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with subclavian artery stenosis are asymptomatic. For many, subclavian artery occlusive disease is found incidentally. When symptoms occur, they are most commonly due to arm ischemia or symptoms of vertebrobasilar ischemia. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulse examination and duplex ultrasound evaluation of the cerebrovascular and upper extremity arterial circulation establish the diagnosis in most patients. On examination, the patient often has a significant difference in brachial systolic blood pressure (&gt;15 mmHg differential) between the affected and normal arm. Duplex ultrasound can readily diagnose and semi-quantify proximal subclavian artery stenoses and demonstrate reversal of flow in the ipsilateral vertebral artery, if present. If needed, advanced arterial imaging that includes the aortic arch vessels and intracranial vessels can be accomplished with magnetic resonance (MR) angiography, computed tomographic (CT) angiography, or catheter-based arteriography. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subclavian <span class=\"nowrap\">stenosis/occlusion</span> is a marker for atherosclerotic disease (eg, carotid, coronary, lower extremity arteries) and is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality related to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Patients with atherosclerosis benefit from secondary prevention measures (ie,&nbsp;treatment of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors). (See <a href=\"#H2120477995\" class=\"local\">'Risk modification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We treat patients with subclavian steal syndrome. The choice of intervention (surgical, endovascular) depends upon the patient's specific anatomy, the presence of concomitant ipsilateral carotid disease, and the patient's overall medical status. Patients with subclavian steal syndrome who are not candidates for intervention are treated with antithrombotic therapy. For asymptomatic patients, the emphasis is on&nbsp;secondary prevention.
