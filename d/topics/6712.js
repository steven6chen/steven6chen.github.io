Most patients show substantial improvement in psychotic symptoms in response to antipsychotics; however, for many, improvement is insufficient to meet stringent criteria for remission, and a substantial proportion experience residual treatment-resistant symptoms. </p><p>Patients who do not respond adequately to antipsychotics should be reevaluated to rule out or address causes other than nonresponsiveness to medication. Current medication and psychosocial interventions should be optimized. Treatment strategies for patients who remain incompletely responsive include changes to antipsychotic doses and drugs, use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>, and drug augmentation. </p><p>This topic addresses the evaluation and management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

No clear consensus exists for a single definition for use across populations and settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-treatment-resistant-schizophrenia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Existing definitions do not clearly distinguish treatment resistance from terms indicating other levels of response, such as partial response, lack of remission, or failure to prevent relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-treatment-resistant-schizophrenia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>For the purpose of determining a patient&rsquo;s eligibility for a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>, we define treatment resistance as an inadequate response to at least two antipsychotic drugs at the maximally tolerated dose within the recommended therapeutic range (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F60624\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60624 \">table 1</a>) in trials lasting six weeks or more. Termination of a medication due to adverse events before reaching the appropriate dose and duration should not be regarded as a failed trial due to nonresponse to the medication.</p><p>Research study has raised questions about the need for antipsychotic trials lasting six weeks or more. Patients with chronic schizophrenia who show no more than minimal improvement in overall psychopathology after two weeks on a new antipsychotic have been found, on average, to be unlikely to show a greater response at a later time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-treatment-resistant-schizophrenia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, these results reflect mean results among groups of patients and may not apply to individual patients, nor do they necessarily apply to first episode patients or to treatment-resistant patients switched to another antipsychotic. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H412052632\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although a sizeable proportion of patients with schizophrenia do not sufficiently respond to antipsychotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-treatment-resistant-schizophrenia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], an absence of consistent definitions and data-collection methods across studies limit our knowledge of the proportion of patients with schizophrenia who are treatment-resistant.

However, because clozapine can cause significant adverse effects, there are a number of steps that should be taken prior to a clozapine trial:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess for other causes of residual schizophrenia symptoms (ie, pseudoresistance) (see <a href=\"#H365611955\" class=\"local\">'Assess for pseudoresistance'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimizing nonpharmacologic treatment (see <a href=\"#H257568719\" class=\"local\">'Optimize nonpharmacologic treatment'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimizing current antipsychotic drug treatment (see <a href=\"#H365611918\" class=\"local\">'Optimize antipsychotic drugs'</a> below)</p><p/><p>If these steps do not lead to symptom remission, and the patient has had at least two antipsychotic trials of six weeks or more at maximally tolerated doses, we would then proceed to a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> trial. (See <a href=\"#H17442645\" class=\"local\">'Clozapine trial'</a> below.)</p><p>Augmentation of antipsychotics with other medications, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or transcranial magnetic stimulation should be reserved for when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a> is not effective, not tolerated, or refused despite multiple attempts at discussing the evidence favoring clozapine with the patient, family, and relevant others. Augmentation with one of these approaches is preferred rather than switching to another treatment if the patient is tolerating the antipsychotic, has experienced a partial response, and has not benefited to a greater degree during prior monotherapy trials. (See <a href=\"#H365620771\" class=\"local\">'Antipsychotic drug augmentation'</a> below.)</p><p>The augmentation strategies are not well supported by evidence from clinical trials (described below). In our clinical experience, however, weighing their risks and benefits with patients and their families often favors treatment, even with ECT. Treatment-resistant schizophrenia causes severe impairment for many patients, greatly diminishing quality of life. Patients and families are often desperate to find effective treatment. For these patients, based on the limited evidence available, we suggest (see <a href=\"#H365620771\" class=\"local\">'Antipsychotic drug augmentation'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over other treatments for patients whose symptoms are principally auditory hallucinations. The availability of rTMS is limited. ECT is a reasonable alternative if rTMS is not available, if positive symptoms other than auditory hallucinations are significant, or if rTMS was ineffective. The administration and side effects of these procedures are described separately. (See <a href=\"#H85760302\" class=\"local\">'Transcranial magnetic stimulation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H85760267\" class=\"local\">'Electroconvulsive therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant over other treatments for persistent negative symptoms. The alpha-2 antagonist antidepressants, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a> or mianserin, are reasonable alternatives if an SSRI was ineffective. The pharmacology, administration, and side effects of these agents are described separately. (See <a href=\"#H85760459\" class=\"local\">'Antidepressant drugs'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>If these treatments are not useful or available, alternative options include augmentation of antipsychotic treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topiramate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for positive symptoms, and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor modulators (glycine or sarcosine) for negative symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H262343550\" class=\"local\">'Other adjunctive medications'</a> below.)</p><p>Further information on each of these strategies, including research evidence where available, is described below.
