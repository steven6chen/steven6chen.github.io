She has had only two episodes of hypoglycemia, both before breakfast. She checked her blood glucose level a few times in the middle of the night, and none of the values were below 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Her glucose diary reveals that only three values have been below 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Glucose values vary from 80 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.4 to 16.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> throughout the day, except before lunch, when they are often below 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. You increase the glargine dose to 22 units at bedtime and advise the patient to limit the total dose of lispro before breakfast to 3 units.</p><p>Two months later, most values before breakfast are in the 80 to 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.4 to 7.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> range, with occasional outliers. Before lunch, before supper, and at bedtime, the glucose values are in the 80 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.4 to 11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> range, again with occasional outliers. The glycated hemoglobin (A1C) is 6.50 percent.</p><p>Six months after the change of basal insulin from NPH to glargine, the patient continues to do well. She cannot tell whether hypoglycemia unawareness has resolved, because insulin reactions are so rare. The A1C is 6.10 percent.</p><p>Management of this patient is discussed further.
