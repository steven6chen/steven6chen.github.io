There are two major forms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DM1, for a century known as Steinert disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DM2, recognized in 1994 as a milder version of DM1</p><p/><p>These autosomal dominant conditions are among the most common forms of adult-onset muscular dystrophy. However, DM is more than simply a muscular dystrophy per se, since affected individuals may show cataracts, cardiac conduction abnormalities, infertility, and insulin resistance. Furthermore, there is a severe congenital form of DM1 with marked developmental disability.</p><p>One consequence of the multisystemic nature of this disorder is that individuals affected by DM1 or DM2 may first present to internists, cardiologists, ophthalmologists, endocrinologists, and pediatricians (in the case of DM1), before they see a neurologist.</p><p>The genetics, pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy will be reviewed here. The prognosis and management of myotonic dystrophy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myotonic dystrophy: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other muscular dystrophies are also discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emery-dreifuss-muscular-dystrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oculopharyngeal-distal-and-congenital-muscular-dystrophies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oculopharyngeal, distal, and congenital muscular dystrophies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) results from an expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3'-untranslated region of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase gene (DMPK gene) on chromosome 19q 13.3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Wild-type individuals have 5 to 34 CTG repeats at this locus, whereas individuals with classic DM1 have repeats in the hundreds to thousands. In DM1, the expansion of a normal allele (&lt;35 repeats) into the abnormal range is rare.</p><p>Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is caused by an expanded CCTG tetranucleotide repeat expansion located in intron 1 of the ZNF9 gene, also known as the CNBP gene, on chromosome 3q 21.3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. On normal alleles, there are 11 to 26 tetranucleotide repeats; on pathogenic alleles, the number of repeats ranges from 75 to more than 11,000, with a mean of 5000 repeats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In both DM1 and DM2, the repeat expansion is transcribed into RNA but remains untranslated. The marked intergenerational instability of the size of the repeat expansion may explain the phenomenon of anticipation, at least in DM1, in which increased size of the expansion is associated with an earlier age of onset and more severe clinical phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Intergenerational contraction of the CTG repeat has also been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>In DM1, the length of the CTG repeat expansion is moderately correlated with disease severity and age of onset (see <a href=\"#H1951197145\" class=\"local\">'Phenotypes'</a> below). Another factor that contributes to the variable clinical expression of DM1 is somatic mosaicism, which is due to instability of the CTG repeat expansion in somatic cells during life. The somatic instability is thought to be due to abnormal DNA repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The CTG expansion is particularly unstable in nondividing cells of the brain, skeletal muscle, and cardiac muscle, whereas the expansion is relatively stable in leukocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]; this probably explains why CTG repeat lengths are 5- to 10-fold longer in the brain, skeletal muscle, and heart compared with CTG repeat lengths in blood leukocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, variations in organ-specific progression of severity for an individual with DM1 are related, at least in part, to the burden of somatic mosaicism within each organ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>In DM2, there is no definite correlation between repeat length and disease severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16</a>]. In addition, there is no maternal or paternal predilection in DM2 for repeat size contraction or expansion. While the CCTG repeat tract displays intergenerational instability, transmission to the next generation more often results in smaller rather than larger repeat lengths, such that anticipation is rare. However, the CCTG repeat tract also displays somatic instability, whereby the CCTG repeat length increases with age. These factors complicate the analysis of repeat length as related to disease onset and severity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myotonic dystrophy provides an example of a novel mechanism of disease, that of RNA toxicity, which results from the expanded repeat in the transcripts from the mutant DM alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), the expanded trinucleotide repeat is located in the 3'-untranslated region of the DMPK gene, and also happens to be located within the promoter region of the adjacent SIX5 gene.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), the expanded tetranucleotide repeat is located within the first intron of the ZNF9 (CNBP) gene.</p><p/><p>In each instance, the gene is transcribed into RNA but is not translated. It is notable that DMPK, a serine-threonine kinase, shows no functional similarity to ZNF9 (CNBP), an RNA binding protein. The fact that both genes were associated by repeat expansions in transcribed but untranslated regions suggests that the mutant RNA might have a significant role in the disease process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Current understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease posits what is known as a &quot;trans&quot; effect, in which the repeat expansions exert a dominant toxic effect on other genes not localized to either the DM1 or DM2 loci. This effect is mediated by two RNA-binding protein families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscleblind-like (MBNL)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CUG-BP- and ETR-3-like-factors (CELF)</p><p/><p>According to this theory, for which there is some experimental support, the CUG and CCUG RNA expansions fold into a hairpin structure, and these mutant RNAs accumulate in the nucleus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In DM1, the mutant CUG repeat containing RNA sequesters MBNL1 and leads to loss of its function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The mutant RNAs alter RNA binding protein activity, which in turn results in aberrant splicing and abnormal function of several genes, including the bridging integrator 1 gene (BIN1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], the skeletal muscle chloride channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], the insulin receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and cardiac troponin T [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Muscle weakness may result from sequestration of MBNL1 by expanded CUG or CCUG repeats, leading to alternative splicing of BIN1 and skipping of muscle-specific exon 11 of BIN1 messenger RNA, which in turn causes disorganized T tubules and impairs excitation-contraction coupling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77706\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77706 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Skeletal muscle chloride channel dysfunction is responsible for the myotonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,26,27</a>] and is related to increased inclusion of exon 7A during misregulated alternative splicing of the CLCN1 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Mutant RNA appears to induce expression of the cardiac transcription factor NKX2-5, which may account for the cardiac conduction disturbances associated with DM1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Dysregulation of alpha-dystrobrevin splicing may also play a role in the muscle weakness and wasting found with DM1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H705139862\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myotonic dystrophy is the most common muscular dystrophy among adults of European ancestry. The prevalence of DM ranges from 1 in 7400 to 1 in 10,700 in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. The prevalence is much higher in certain regions, including Quebec in Canada and the Basque region of Spain, suggesting a founder effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,33,34</a>]. Among non-white populations in Taiwan and South Africa, DM1 is uncommon or rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>].</p><p>Though less well-studied, reports from Europe suggest the prevalence of DM2 is similar to that of DM1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that DM2 is less frequent than DM1 in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1951197145\"><span class=\"h1\">PHENOTYPES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2) are similar in that both are multisystem disorders characterized by skeletal muscle weakness and myotonia (ie, abnormally slow or delayed muscle relaxation following normal muscle contraction with a characteristic neurophysiological signature on EMG testing), cardiac conduction abnormalities, cataracts, and other abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75472\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75472 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F51888\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51888 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15,17,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17,41</a>]. DM1 is further divided into congenital, childhood, classic, and mild phenotypes.</p><p>In general, the severity of the DM1 phenotype correlates loosely with the CTG repeat size, but there is considerable variability and overlap between phenotypes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F110272\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110272 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with a CTG repeat size between 38 and 49, designated premutation status or mutable normal, are asymptomatic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mutation of 50 to approximately 150 CTG repeats can manifest as a phenotype characterized by mild myotonia, weakness, or cataracts.

Affected infants have a characteristic &quot;V&quot; shape of the upper lip that results from facial diplegia. Estimates of the incidence of congenital myotonic dystrophy vary widely, ranging from 2.1 to 28.6 per 100,000 live births in different studies, few of which were population-based [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>].</p><p>In some cases, DM1 may present before birth as polyhydramnios, talipes (clubfoot), and reduced fetal movement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In the most severely affected infants, polyhydramnios is common during pregnancy and is related to disturbance in swallowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-52</a>]. Labor also tends to be either prolonged or abbreviated, presumably on the basis of maternal uterine muscle involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,53</a>].</p><p>Myotonia is not usually present in the first year of life, and electrical myotonia is rare. Respiratory involvement is common and is the leading cause of death in the neonatal period. Mechanical ventilation is required for 70 to 80 percent or more of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,47</a>]. Gastrointestinal and feeding difficulties are also common, with many children requiring a nasogastric or gastric feeding tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. With intensive support, most infants survive the neonatal period, but the overall mortality rate is approximately 15 to 20 percent, and approaches 40 percent in severely affected infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In severely affected infants, cardiomyopathy may be apparent early on and contribute to neonatal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,54</a>].</p><p>In early childhood, there is often a gradual improvement of motor function. Despite this improvement, some degree of hypotonia and facial weakness persist; at age three to five, foot deformities, learning, and behavioral abnormalities present as the main clinical problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Subsequently, pronounced delays are experienced in motor and mental development with mental retardation in 50 to 60 percent of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/52,55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,55,56</a>].</p><p>There appears to be no correlation between the severity of congenital myotonic dystrophy at birth and the extent of complications during teenage years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. As patients with congenital DM1 age, they develop many of the symptoms and signs of classic, adult-onset DM1, such as the distal predominance of muscle weakness, myotonia, and ECG abnormalities. Those patients who survive early childhood typically experience significant cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality. Serious cardiac rhythm disturbances may occur as early as the second decade of life in children with the congenital or infantile form of DM1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>The CTG repeat size associated with congenital DM1 is usually &gt;1000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], though one report noted a few cases with CTG repeat lengths between 730 and 1000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Inheritance of congenital DM1 is overwhelmingly maternal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,59,60</a>]. This phenomenon stems from the much greater likelihood for anticipation (ie, expansions of CTG repeats) to occur in maternal compared with paternal transmissions. It is not uncommon for an adult (typically the mother) to be diagnosed with myotonic dystrophy only after giving birth to an affected neonate, underscoring the potential for subclinical presentation of this disorder.</p><p>Only a small number of paternally inherited cases of congenital myotonic dystrophy have been reported in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/61-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-65</a>]. Whereas mothers of infants with maternally transmitted congenital myotonic dystrophy have larger mean trinucleotide (CTG) repeat sizes than mothers of patients with childhood or adult onset disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>], fathers of infants with paternally transmitted congenital DM1 have small repeat sizes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> are asymptomatic at the time of the affected child's birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3074915823\"><span class=\"h2\">Childhood DM1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The childhood (juvenile) form of DM1 typically presents before the age of 10 years with the involvement of systems and organs other than skeletal muscle. In most cases, the initial manifestations are cognitive and behavioral problems such as intellectual impairment with low IQ, attentional deficits, executive dysfunction, anxiety, and mood disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,68-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,68-71</a>].

Over time, affected children develop muscle symptoms and physical disability that is similar to severe adult-onset classic DM1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,70,71</a>].</p><p>Serious cardiac rhythm disturbances may occur in asymptomatic adolescents with no or only subtle signs of myotonic dystrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

In general, DM2 is a less severe disease than classic DM1. In most cases, weakness predominantly involves the proximal muscles, particularly the hip girdle muscles. There is no clear correlation in DM2 between CCTG repeat size and age of onset or other measures of disease severity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2630427080\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of myotonic dystrophy at presentation differ according to phenotype (see <a href=\"#H1951197145\" class=\"local\">'Phenotypes'</a> above), though most share muscle weakness and myotonia (ie, abnormally slow or delayed muscle relaxation following a normal muscle contraction) as characteristic manifestations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Skeletal muscle weakness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skeletal muscle weakness is a characteristic feature of DM1 and DM2.

Less commonly, weakness occurs in the quadriceps, respiratory muscles, palatal and pharyngeal muscles, tongue, and extraocular muscles. Muscles of the pelvic girdle, the hamstrings, and ankle plantar flexors are relatively spared in most cases of DM1.</p><p>Patients with DM1 often have a characteristic facial appearance due to the pattern and longstanding nature of the muscle weakness and wasting. The face is long and narrow and the palate is high arched. The cheeks are hollowed and the jaw sags. Ptosis and wasting of the sternocleidomastoid muscles are common in DM1 and typically absent in DM2.</p><p>The natural history of DM1 is that of gradual progression in weakness.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study that followed 50 patients aged 16 to 67 years with DM1, muscle weakness at baseline was symmetrical, with neck flexor and distal muscles weaker than proximal muscle groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Using manual muscle testing, the average strength decline was approximately 1 percent per year, similar for men and women, and more rapid for distal than proximal muscles (2 to 3 percent for hand grip flexors and 1.2 to 1.6 percent per year for hip flexors).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 158 patients with DM1 who had assessment of finger flexor muscle strength using a hand-held dynamometer, strength diminished at a rate of 1.18 <span class=\"nowrap\">kgN/year</span> for women and 1.61 <span class=\"nowrap\">kgN/year</span> for men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p/><p>As the disease progresses, distal muscles become increasingly weak, and proximal muscles, perhaps spared in the early stages, begin to weaken so that gait and stability slowly deteriorate. Thus, patients with DM1 develop a combination of distal and proximal weakness (foot dorsiflexor weakness, along with knee extensor and hip abductor and flexor weakness) that contributes to an increased incidence of falls. This point is illustrated by the finding that falls and stumbles in patients with DM1 are 10 times more frequent than in a group of healthy volunteers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2422606215\"><span class=\"h3\">Weakness in DM2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In DM2, neck flexors and finger flexors muscles are affected in the earliest stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Prior to the identification of its genetic basis, DM2 went by various names, including proximal myotonic myopathy (PROMM) and proximal myotonic dystrophy (PDM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>].

Typically, patients with DM1 come to medical attention because of mental retardation or severe muscle weakness and myotonia, whereas patients with DM2 usually present with muscle pain, stiffness, fatigue, or proximal muscle weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The clinical diagnosis of one of the myotonic dystrophies can be readily established when there is muscle weakness and clinical myotonia in the setting of a positive family history. A family history of affected neonates (congenital myotonic dystrophy) points to the diagnosis of DM1, as does a distribution of weakness that includes the neck, face, and distal muscles with relative sparing of the proximal muscles. Prominent early involvement of neck flexors, finger flexors, and, later, hip girdle muscles and sparing facial and hand intrinsic muscles, should suggest the diagnosis of DM2.</p><p>Because genetic testing is the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis of DM1 and DM2, the diagnostic role of electromyography is limited. However, it is still important in atypical cases where the detection of myotonia provides support for the diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy. Electromyography is also used when molecular testing for DM1 or DM2 is normal. In such cases, the demonstration of electrical myotonia supports the alternative diagnosis of a channelopathy, such as myotonia congenita, paramyotonia, and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis.</p><p>In some instances the diagnosis may be challenging for both DM1 and DM2. As an example, patients may present with muscle pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mild to moderate elevations in serum creatine kinase, or with an extramuscular manifestation of DM in the absence of significant muscle weakness or a family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/84,133\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,133</a>]. In such circumstances, a high index of suspicion for a myotonic dystrophy is required so that appropriate testing can be carried out and the diagnosis established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific genetic testing to demonstrate the presence of an expanded CTG repeat in the DMPK gene is the gold standard for the diagnosis of DM1. Normal DMPK gene alleles contain 5 to 34 CTG repeats. Mutable normal alleles (premutation alleles) contain 35 to 49 repeats. Children of individuals with the premutation are at increased risk of inheriting a larger repeat size and having symptoms. Full penetrance alleles of &ge;50 CTG repeats are associated with disease manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p>Specific genetic testing for the CCTG repeat in the ZNF9 (CNBP) gene is appropriate if DM1 testing is negative and the clinical suspicion of myotonic dystrophy is high. DM2 is caused by a single mutational mechanism, a CCTG tetranucleotide expansion of &ge;75 repeats (up to 11,000 repeats). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Electromyography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is appropriate to begin the confirmatory testing for DM1 and DM2 with genetic analysis and omit electrodiagnostic studies when there is a strong clinical suspicion for the diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy. However, electromyography (EMG) is still an important test in the evaluation of select patients suspected of having a myopathic disorder, such as one of the myotonic dystrophies. It is useful for demonstrating the presence of myotonia if this has not been found clinically or if uncertainty persists regarding its presence or absence on examination.</p><p>Electrical myotonia typically consists of repetitive discharges of muscle fiber action potentials at 20 to 80 Hz that wax and wane in amplitude and frequency, producing a sound often reminiscent of a dive bomber or a motorcycle engine when audio-amplified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electromyography#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electromyography&quot;, section on 'Myotonic discharges'</a>.)</p><p>Not every muscle will show evidence for myotonia, so a thorough EMG examination should include evaluation of multiple distal arm and facial muscles.

In DM1, it tends to be waxing-waning (ie, classic discharges that increase and decrease in both amplitude and frequency), whereas in DM2 it tends to be waning (ie, discharges that gradually decrease in frequency or amplitude). The most distal muscles (the tibialis anterior and first dorsal interosseous) are most likely to have myotonic discharge in both disorders. The severity of myotonia correlates with muscle weakness in DM1, but not in DM2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>].
