A person who donates blood is called a blood donor. In the United States, people do not get paid for giving blood. People who give blood do it because they want to.</p><p>When a person gives blood, his or her blood goes to a &quot;blood bank&quot; or specialized laboratory. There it is tested, made ready for use, and stored until it is needed. Hospitals can get blood from a blood bank to give to patients who need it. When a person gets donated blood, it is called a &quot;blood transfusion.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16276809\"><span class=\"h1\">Who might need donated blood?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People might need donated blood if they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose a lot of blood in an accident or during surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a medical condition that affects their blood</p><p/><p>Some people have their own blood drawn and stored if they are planning to have surgery soon. That way, if they need blood during surgery, they can get their own blood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16276816\"><span class=\"h1\">Who can give blood?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People can give blood at age 17 or older. (Some US states let people give blood at age 16.)</p><p>People who want to give blood also need to be healthy and meet certain conditions. Meeting these conditions is important, because it helps to make sure that a donor is healthy enough to give blood. It also helps doctors make sure that the person getting the blood won't get an infection from the donated blood.</p><p>Some people want to give blood because they know their blood will be tested, and they want to know if they have certain infections, such as HIV. People <strong>should not</strong> give blood for this reason.</p><p>To check that you meet all of the conditions for giving blood, a doctor, nurse, or trained staff person will ask you questions and do an exam beforehand.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16276823\"><span class=\"h1\">What questions will I be asked before I give blood?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A staff person will ask you questions about:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical conditions you have or had, including past surgeries</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any recent vaccines that you have gotten</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether you have been exposed to certain infections, like malaria or hepatitis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How you feel that day &ndash; You can't give blood if you don't feel well, have a fever, or are taking certain medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Countries you have lived in or traveled to</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sex partners you have had &ndash; Some people have a higher risk of passing on certain infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any tattoos or body piercings you have</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any drug use</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your weight &ndash; People who weigh less than 110 pounds (50 kilograms) are usually not allowed to give blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your last blood donation &ndash; People can't give blood too often.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16276830\"><span class=\"h1\">What will the exam be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The staff person will do a quick exam and check your temperature, blood pressure, and pulse (heartbeat).</p><p>He or she will also take a small amount of blood from your fingertip to make sure that you do not have a condition called anemia. People with anemia can feel tired or weak, because their body does not have enough red blood cells to carry oxygen. If you have anemia, you can't give blood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16276837\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens when I give blood?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You will sit or lie back in a comfortable chair. The staff person will put a needle in your arm. The needle will stay in place while blood is collected from your arm. Giving blood takes about 15 minutes or less.</p><p>After you give blood, another staff person will give you some snacks and drinks. He or she will also watch you for a short time to make sure that you don't have any side effects.</p><p>Before you leave, the staff person will give you a phone number to call in case you have any problems or questions. You should also call this number if any of the answers you gave earlier were incorrect, or if you remember something you did not think of or did not feel comfortable sharing at the time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16276844\"><span class=\"h1\">What side effects can I have from giving blood?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common side effects include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting a bruise or feeling sore where the needle went in the skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired afterward</p><p/><p>Some people can feel faint or pass out. This is more likely to happen if it is your first time giving blood or if you are young or your weight is low. To help prevent feeling faint or passing out, drink a big bottle of water before you give blood.</p><p>After you give blood, your body will make new blood to replace it. This takes a little while. Most people need to wait at least 8 weeks before they are allowed to donate blood again. Some people take extra iron to help them make more blood. But you should talk with your doctor before trying this.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16276851\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my donated blood be tested for problems?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. All donated blood is tested for certain infections that people can catch from infected blood. Some of these infections include HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, West Nile virus, Zika virus, and syphilis.</p><p>If your blood has any of these infections, the blood bank will let you know. They will also safely get rid of your blood so that it cannot infect anyone else. However, it is very important not to give blood as a way to get tested for these infections. Doing this could put another person at risk.</p><p>Donated blood is not tested for other things like cancer or cholesterol.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16276858\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I get sick after I give blood?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you get sick within a few days of giving blood, call the number the staff person gave you. Depending on your symptoms, the blood bank might throw out your blood so it doesn't infect anyone else. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16276865\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-caused-by-low-iron-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anemia caused by low iron (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-aids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: HIV/AIDS (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hepatitis B (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hepatitis C (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donation-and-transfusion-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Blood donation and transfusion (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-caused-by-low-iron-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Anemia caused by low iron in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
