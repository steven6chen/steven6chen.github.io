However, CMV disease may still occur despite preventive therapies, especially when they are not dosed adequately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-active-cytomegalovirus-infection-and-disease-in-kidney-transplant-recipients/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

The primary risk factor for active CMV infection or disease is the CMV serostatus of the <span class=\"nowrap\">donor/recipient</span> pair. CMV <span class=\"nowrap\">donor-positive/recipient-negative</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(D+/R-)</span> patients are at highest risk, CMV R+ patients are at intermediate risk, and CMV <span class=\"nowrap\">D-/R-</span> patients are at low risk. Other risk factors are the use of lymphocyte-depleting agents (eg, antithymocyte globulin) for induction immunosuppression, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> for maintenance immunosuppression, and administration of lymphocyte-depleting therapy or high-dose glucocorticoids to treat acute cellular rejection. (See <a href=\"#H297278654\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Through direct and indirect effects, active CMV infection and disease are associated with an increased risk of acute allograft rejection and death. (See <a href=\"#H1563671468\" class=\"local\">'Clinical significance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CMV <span class=\"nowrap\">D+/R-</span> and CMV R+ kidney transplant recipients are at high risk for active CMV infection and disease and require a CMV preventive strategy. Preventive strategies include a prophylactic or preemptive approach. (See <a href=\"#H3157709241\" class=\"local\">'Indications for a preventive strategy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among CMV <span class=\"nowrap\">D+/R-</span> recipients, we suggest a prophylactic rather than preemptive approach (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). While prophylactic therapy is associated with a higher incidence of adverse medication effects, it is easier to coordinate, and some studies suggest that a prophylactic approach decreases the risk of CMV infection and disease. We also use a prophylactic approach for CMV R+ recipients, although these patients are at somewhat lower risk for CMV infection and disease. We start CMV prophylaxis in the immediate posttransplant period. (See <a href=\"#H2459598319\" class=\"local\">'Preventive strategies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The specific regimen depends on the serotype combination and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For CMV <span class=\"nowrap\">D+/R-</span> patients, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a> at 900 mg orally once daily for six months following transplantation, with the dose adjusted for renal function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For CMV R+ patients, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a> at 900 mg orally once daily for three months following transplantation, with the dose adjusted for renal function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For kidney transplant recipients with a creatinine clearance of 40 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> the appropriate dose of prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a> is 450 mg once daily.</p><p/><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among CMV <span class=\"nowrap\">D-/R-</span> patients, we give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> 200 mg orally twice daily for three months following transplantation for herpes simplex virus (HSV) prophylaxis. If a CMV preemptive strategy is used in CMV <span class=\"nowrap\">D+/R-</span> or R+ patients, we would also give HSV prophylaxis with acyclovir.
