Agitated saline contrast provides contrast in the right heart and enables detection of right to left shunts. Opacification of the left ventricular (LV) cavity by contrast agents developed to traverse the pulmonary vasculature permits improved endocardial border detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Contrast echocardiography can also enhance delineation of Doppler signal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Additional uses of contrast echocardiography are to assess myocardial perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and viability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The development and safety of microbubbles for echocardiographic contrast and the optimization of the echocardiographic settings for visualizing contrast will be reviewed here. The current and potential clinical applications of CE are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contrast echocardiography: Clinical applications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBUBBLE CONTRAST AGENTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of contrast</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As sound travels from one medium to another, the change in density (known as acoustic impedance) at the interface causes the reflection of sound waves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The greater the difference in the media densities, the more echogenic the interface. Gas is an excellent contrast agent since it is 100,000 times less dense than blood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Agitated saline contrast</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Agitated saline solution administered via intravenous injection provides air microbubble contrast in the right heart. The air microbubbles are short-lived and diffuse into the lungs when traversing the pulmonary circulation. Therefore the microbubbles enter the left heart only in the presence of a right to left intracardiac or extracardiac (pulmonary arteriovenous) shunt. Saline microbubbles are therefore helpful in examining the right heart and identifying shunts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contrast-echocardiography-clinical-applications#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contrast echocardiography: Clinical applications&quot;, section on 'Clinical applications for agitated saline contrast'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patent-foramen-ovale#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patent foramen ovale&quot;, section on 'Ultrasound techniques'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Transpulmonary passage of contrast agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To allow left heart evaluation, an ideal contrast microbubble must be small and durable enough to traverse the pulmonary circulation to pass into the left heart from an intravenous injection. Improvements in contrast agents have resulted from the exploitation of knowledge concerning both the mechanisms of echogenicity and the impediments to transpulmonary passage.</p><p>Larger microbubble size enhances durability, which is proportional to the square of the bubble radius [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, a small bubble size (diameter &le;10 &micro;m) is required for successful transpulmonary passage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Contrast agents must meet the following requirements: safe, metabolically inert, long lasting, strong reflector of ultrasound, and small enough to pass through capillaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Agitated saline, dextrose, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diatrizoate-meglumine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diatrizoate meglumine</a> (Renograffin-76), and hydrogen peroxide are largely inadequate for left heart evaluation because of both large bubble size and instability resulting from the rapid diffusion of air into the blood. These agents have therefore only been utilized for the left-sided assessment of myocardial perfusion via injection into the aortic root or directly into the coronary arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/3,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8-10</a>].</p><p>Surrounding the gas bubble in a durable shell enables adequate durability while keeping bubble size small enough to traverse the pulmonary circulation. A number of microbubble capsules have been investigated but produced bubbles that were too large (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indocyanine-green-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indocyanine green</a> dye) or too short-lived (eg, polysaccharide or gelatin encapsulated air) to opacify the left heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Further stabilization of the microbubble was achieved through use of a 5 percent human <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albumin-solution-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albumin solution</a>, which forms a thin shell of denatured albumin when sonicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]; this led to the development of Albunex as the first FDA approved myocardial contrast agent. However, the clinical utility of Albunex was limited because microbubble air loss results in large decreases in echogenicity, although it causes only slight decreases in bubble diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Further improvements in microbubble capsules have been incorporated into second generation agents. Gas diffusion was decreased via the use of inert gases (eg, perfluorocarbons) to form the microbubbles. Improved bubble surface stability was attained through use of innovative colloidal suspensions or emulsions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Second generation contrast agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Of the following second generation contrast agents, three (Optison, Definity, and Lumason) are currently FDA approved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A human albumin-based shell enclosing perfluoropropane gas (FS069 or Optison) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

One report compiled five cases of cerebral ischemic events (three ischemic strokes and two transient ischemic attacks) occurring immediately or within five minutes of agitated saline contrast study demonstrating a right to left shunt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Available data are not sufficient to estimate the incidence of such events, although such complications appear to be rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Second generation contrast safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The FDA approved Optison and Definity for cardiac indications after clinical trial experience including detailed safety evaluations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Initial postmarketing approval surveillance over five years and in greater than one million patients demonstrated no medically significant risks other than rare allergic events at a rate of approximately 1 per 10,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The rare severe allergic reactions are thought to be a variant of the type I hypersensitivity reaction known as Complement Activation Related Pseudo Allergy (CARPA). These are not immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated. There is a higher rate of reaction in women and atopic individuals. CARPA reactions may be mild to moderate (urticaria, pruritis, tingling, sneezing) or severe (wheezing, angioedema, cyanosis, anaphylactic shock) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. All personnel utilizing these agents should be trained in recognizing and treating these reactions. </p><p>Central nervous system reactions have also rarely been reported and may or may not be associated with hypersensitivity reactions. Reported adverse events are generally infrequent and mild and may include headache, weakness, fatigue, palpitations, nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, altered sense of smell or taste, dyspnea, urticaria, pruritus, back pain, chest pain, or rash.</p><p>The FDA subsequently received reports of serious cardiopulmonary reactions and four deaths following administration of ultrasound microbubble contrast agent (Definity or Optison). Most of the deaths occurred one to twelve hours following administration of the contrast agent in patients with severe underlying conditions. In October 2007 the FDA issued revised labeling requirements including a black box warning with new contraindications for use of these agents.</p><p>Following these labeling changes, many raised concerns about the potential confounding effect of pseudocomplications on the evaluation of safety and pointed out that the risk is relatively small given the very large number of patients who have received contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The importance of controlling for background risk was later illustrated by a multicenter retrospective study of 42,408 inpatients and outpatients receiving Optison or Definity contrast agents who were compared with 15,989 matched patients undergoing echocardiography without contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. One death and five nonfatal myocardial infarctions were observed within 24 hours in the contrast group; the rate of these events was not different from those among matched control subjects.</p><p>In 2008, the FDA revised labeling requirements for contrast to include caution administering to unstable patients and the need for monitoring but subsequently revised those warnings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In 2011, the FDA removed the previously mandated 30-minute monitoring period after contrast administration in patients with pulmonary hypertension or unstable cardiopulmonary conditions. This was largely based on six studies (three with Definity and three with Optison) that showed reassuring results. Each manufacturer completed a three-part postmarketing safety evaluation. One part used a prospective registry of approximately 1000 patients in routine clinical practice to determine risk of death or serious adverse events in patients receiving contrast. There were no deaths or adverse events in either registry. The second part involved a prospective invasive hemodynamic study to study the hemodynamic effects of contrast on pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in patients with normal and elevated PASP. There was no significant change in PASP or PVR in the contrast groups. The third part was a propensity-matched outcomes study in critically ill patients having an echocardiogram with or without contrast. This showed no increase in mortality risk in the contrast groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/24-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-29</a>]. The revised labeling of all contrast agents now lists an acknowledgment that serious cardiopulmonary reactions after contrast administration are rare and typically occur within 30 minutes.</p><p>The FDA in late 2016 and early 2017 removed the contraindication for administration of Optison, Lumason, and Definity in patients with intracardiac shunts. This was based on a number of studies that demonstrated the safety of these agents in patients with known shunts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Contrast agents can be used in left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] and extracorporeal membrane oxygenator (ECMO), though care must be taken to avoid ECMO circuit shutdown due to bubble sensing safety systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>As of August 2017, the only contraindications were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For Definity, known hypersensitivity to perflutren</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For Optison, known hypersensitivity to perflutren, blood, blood products, or albumin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For Lumason, known hypersensitivity to sulfur hexafluoride or the inactive components of Lumason</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intra-arterial injection</p><p/><p>Limited data suggest that second-generation contrast agents also appear safe for off-label use in children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. In a single-center retrospective review of 113 patients between age 5 and 21 years (mean age 17.8 years) who received echocontrast between 2005 and 2014, 13 patients (12 percent) reported a variety of symptoms (eg, chest pain, fatigue, <span class=\"nowrap\">back/neck</span> pain, headache, dizziness, or shortness of breath) lasting less than 60 seconds during contrast administration, and none of the 113 patients were found to have had an adverse event within 24 hours of contrast administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>There are no data on the safety of contrast agents in pregnancy or lactation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">OPTIMAL ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC SETTINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contrast agent durability is dependent upon both bubble composition and ultrasonic characteristics. Alterations in the echocardiographic settings can therefore optimize both microbubble durability and contrast intensity. Guidelines for equipment setup and contrast agent administration are included in the 2008 American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) consensus statement on contrast agents in echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Harmonic detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Second harmonic detection systems improve the signal-to-noise ratio of contrast images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>Microbubbles resonate (shake) with exposure to ultrasound energy at frequencies that are multiples of the ultrasound frequency emitted from the transducer. This results in the emission of fundamentals (same frequency) and harmonics (multiples) of the frequency to which they are exposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. By setting the imaging frequency of the echo system to a harmonic of the emitted frequency, the system &quot;filters&quot; out all returning fundamental frequencies from the myocardium and enhances the microbubble signal.</p><p>The contrast intensity improves two to three times using second harmonics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Other advantages to harmonic imaging include decreased artifact and shadowing, as well as enhanced contrast detection in areas of low microbubble concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Harmonic imaging also improves endocardial tracking even without echocardiographic contrast (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiography-essentials-physics-and-instrumentation#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiography essentials: Physics and instrumentation&quot;, section on 'Second harmonic imaging'</a>). However, the ejection fraction obtained by harmonic imaging along with contrast echocardiography provides the closest correlation with the radionuclide ejection fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Intermittent or transient imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a sound wave interacts with a microbubble, some of the energy is reflected, but a portion actively destroys the microbubbles. As a result, continuous ultrasound imaging results in depletion of the microbubble population, giving a suboptimal signal to noise ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Increased microbubble durability may be accomplished with intermittent or transient response imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Ultrasound that is emitted only once per cardiac cycle, or as infrequently as every 5 to 10 beats, improves microbubble contrast intensity inversely with bubble transit velocity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Controversy exists as to which part of the cardiac cycle should be imaged; however, either systolic or diastolic imaging appears to improve the contrast effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Low mechanical index imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another technique to decrease the destruction of microbubbles is low mechanical index imaging. If a very low acoustic power is transmitted, fewer bubbles will be destroyed even with continuous imaging. Commercial echocardiographic machines now have this &quot;real time&quot; contrast imaging and studies assessing its utility are ongoing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Gray discrimination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ability of the naked eye to discriminate different levels of gray is limited. As a result, techniques which reliably quantify small changes in gray level (as with coronary ischemia or the assessment of myocardial viability) are under investigation using subtraction videodensitometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>] and post-processing color-coding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Images may also be enhanced using Doppler technology with power-Doppler imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ultrasound pulse inversion technology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Mode of contrast injection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mode of contrast injection can affect image quality.
