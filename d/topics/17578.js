It typically occurs in HIV-infected patients with a CD4 count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> who are not receiving potent antiretroviral therapy or appropriate prophylaxis.</p><p>This topic will review the treatment and prevention of PCP in patients with HIV infection. Topic reviews on the clinical presentation and diagnosis of PCP in HIV-infected individuals and PCP in the HIV-uninfected host are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of Pneumocystis pulmonary infection in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pneumonia-in-hiv-uninfected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-pneumonia-in-hiv-uninfected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23513275\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antimicrobial therapy directed against <em>P. jirovecii</em> is the mainstay of treatment for <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia (PCP). In addition, some patients will require adjunctive corticosteroids. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated to restore cellular immunity. For those patients already receiving ART, we continue their ART regimen while they are being treated for PCP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-antiretroviral-regimens-for-the-treatment-naive-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting antiretroviral regimens for the treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H25051059\" class=\"local\">'Timing of ART initiation'</a> below.) </p><p>Empiric therapy for PCP should be initiated pending the results of the diagnostic evaluation if there is a high clinical suspicion for PCP (eg, CD4 count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> hypoxemia, interstitial infiltrates). In certain situations, it is not possible to confirm the diagnosis, and patients are treated and monitored for clinical response (see <a href=\"#H23513314\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring patients on treatment'</a> below). A detailed discussion on the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of PCP is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of Pneumocystis pulmonary infection in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After patients complete their initial treatment regimen, antimicrobial therapy should be continued at lower doses to prevent recurrent infection (ie, secondary prophylaxis). This preventive therapy can be discontinued after immune recovery has been achieved for a prolonged period of time. (See <a href=\"#H887410988\" class=\"local\">'Secondary prophylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23512798\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors impact the approach to treatment for patients with PCP. Thus, prior to initiating therapy, we assess the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Drug allergies</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX), a sulfa-containing regimen, is the preferred treatment for PCP. For patients with a sulfa allergy, a second-line regimen is generally used. However, we may desensitize certain patients to TMP-SMX, such as those with severe PCP, if their sulfa allergy is non-life threatening. (See <a href=\"#H887412817\" class=\"local\">'Preferred regimen'</a> below and <a href=\"#H23513281\" class=\"local\">'Alternative regimens'</a> below and <a href=\"#H549880787\" class=\"local\">'Desensitization for patients with a sulfa allergy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Respiratory status </strong>&ndash; We evaluate the patient&rsquo;s respiratory status to help assess the severity of disease. We first assess the patient clinically by measuring their respiratory rate and evaluating the use of accessory muscles of respiration. We then measure arterial oxygenation using pulse oximetry. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-pulmonary-symptoms#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the HIV-infected patient with pulmonary symptoms&quot;, section on 'Pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas analysis'</a>.)<strong> </strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Guidelines suggest obtaining an arterial blood gas in patients with evidence of respiratory distress, tachypnea, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypoxia to further assess the severity of disease (eg, alveolar to arterial oxygen [A-a] gradient) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, with the reliability of pulse oximetry, we no longer obtain a blood gas solely to determine the need for corticosteroids if a patient has clear evidence of hypoxemia (eg, resting room air oxygen saturation &lt;92 percent). A blood gas may still be useful to help determine if the patient requires placement in the intensive care unit <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if an intravenous regimen should be used. (See <a href=\"#H549879554\" class=\"local\">'Severe disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Factors that impact absorption</strong> &ndash; Most patients with PCP can be treated with an oral regimen. However, some individuals may have a concurrent condition that impacts their ability to take an oral medication (eg, severe esophageal candidiasis, diarrhea). Such patients will require intravenous (IV) therapy until these other conditions have improved.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H494481457\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial approach to treatment (eg, the choice of agent, the mode of administration, and the use of adjunctive corticosteroids) is determined primarily by the level of oxygenation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the A-a gradient. An overview of the management of patients with mild, moderate, or severe disease is reviewed here. A discussion of the specific antimicrobial agents is found below. (See <a href=\"#H494481841\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial regimens'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H549879690\"><span class=\"h3\">Mild disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with mild disease have an A-a O<sub>2 </sub>gradient &lt;35 mmHg <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a partial pressure of arterial oxygen &ge;70 mmHg.</p><p>We administer oral therapy to such patients unless they have a concurrent infection or comorbidity that would impact absorption.

Alternative regimens include trimethoprim-dapsone or clindamycin-primaquine; we generally do not use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atovaquone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atovaquone</a> as initial treatment for moderate disease. In addition, individuals with moderate disease require adjunctive corticosteroids. (See <a href=\"#H887412817\" class=\"local\">'Preferred regimen'</a> below and <a href=\"#H461789961\" class=\"local\">'Alternative regimens for mild to moderate disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H23512991\" class=\"local\">'Corticosteroid regimen'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H549879554\"><span class=\"h3\">Severe disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A patient has severe disease when the A-a O<sub>2</sub> gradient is &ge;45 mmHg, the partial pressure of arterial oxygen is &lt;60 mmHg, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> there is potential for fatigue leading to respiratory failure (eg, a high respiratory rate or a partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide that is normal or higher than normal in a patient with hypoxia).</p><p>We recommend TMP-SMX for patients with severe disease. Individuals should receive intravenous therapy until they are clinically stable (eg, PaO2 &ge;60 mmHg, respiratory rate &lt;25) and are able to be transitioned to oral treatment. Adjunctive corticosteroids should also be administered. (See <a href=\"#H887412817\" class=\"local\">'Preferred regimen'</a> below and <a href=\"#H23512991\" class=\"local\">'Corticosteroid regimen'</a> below.)</p><p>For those with severe disease who cannot take TMP-SMX (eg, severe sulfonamide allergy), we typically suggest clindamycin-primaquine. For such patients, we obtain a detailed history to assess the type and severity of their past sulfonamide reaction since certain individuals can be desensitized to TMP-SMX.

This must be taken into consideration when deciding who requires hospitalization. In general, the following are indications for inpatient therapy: disease severe enough to warrant treatment with corticosteroids, regardless of whether intravenous or oral anti-Pneumocystis therapy is used; initial treatment with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentamidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentamidine</a> given the potential side effects of therapy (in particular, hypoglycemia and hypotension); and patients for whom compliance with therapy or laboratory monitoring is likely to be difficult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H494481841\"><span class=\"h2\">Antimicrobial regimens</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H887412817\"><span class=\"h3\">Preferred regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TMP-SMX is the preferred regimen for the treatment of PCP in HIV-infected patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61052\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61052 \">table 1</a>). Therapy should be administered for 21 days. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Trimethoprim</a> is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, and sulfamethoxazole is a dihydropteroate synthetase inhibitor; when coupled together they are synergistic in eradicating <em>P. jirovecii</em>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The standard dose of TMP-SMX is 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> orally or intravenously in three or four divided doses. Dosing of TMP-SMX is based upon the TMP component and expressed as <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day of TMP. Dose modifications for renal impairment may be needed; detailed dosing recommendations are available in the TMP-SMX drug information monograph included within UpToDate.</p><p>The severity of disease dictates whether oral or intravenous therapy should be used:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with mild to moderate disease, we prefer oral therapy since TMP-SMX has excellent oral absorption. For most patients, this turns out to be two double-strength tablets given every six or eight hours, depending upon body weight. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe disease, we administer IV therapy. (See <a href=\"#H549879554\" class=\"local\">'Severe disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>We treat with TMP-SMX even if the patient was prescribed TMP-SMX for PCP prophylaxis (see <a href=\"#H2384560850\" class=\"local\">'Preventing initial infection'</a> below). Most patients who develop PCP while being prescribed TMP-SMX prophylaxis do so because of non-adherence to their medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although sulfa-containing agents can result in resistance mutations in the dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) gene of <em>P. jirovecii</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], drug resistance leading to treatment failure is unlikely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The efficacy of TMP-SMX for treating PCP has been most clearly demonstrated in individuals with severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. As an example, in a randomized trial of 70 patients with severe PCP that compared TMP-SMX with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentamidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentamidine</a>, the survival rate was significantly higher in those receiving TMP-SMX (86 versus 61 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Among those with mild to moderate disease, there are no high quality data to support the use of TMP-SMX over one of the other agents. However, based upon our clinical experience, and the experience of other experts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], we suggest TMP-SMX for initial treatment of mild to moderate PCP. (See <a href=\"#H461789961\" class=\"local\">'Alternative regimens for mild to moderate disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23513281\"><span class=\"h3\">Alternative regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For those who are unable to take TMP-SMX, the choice of which alternative agent to use is based upon the severity of disease, the patient&rsquo;s intolerances and allergies, and the ease of administration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61052\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61052 \">table 1</a>). Dose modifications for renal impairment may be needed for certain agents; detailed dosing recommendations are available in the specific drug information monographs included within UpToDate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461789961\"><span class=\"h4\">Alternative regimens for mild to moderate disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several alternative regimens can be used for the treatment of mild to moderate disease; the available data do not favor one over the other. This was illustrated in a multicenter trial that randomly assigned 181 patients with mild to moderate PCP (defined as an A-a O<sub>2 </sub>gradient &lt;45 mmHg) to therapy with TMP-SMX, TMP-dapsone, or clindamycin-primaquine for 21 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients with an A-a O<sub>2 </sub>gradient between 35 and 45 mmHg also received corticosteroids. There was no significant difference between groups in the rate of treatment failure or mortality (approximately 5 percent in each treatment arm). However, the risk of hematologic and hepatotoxicity were significantly more frequent in those receiving clindamycin-primaquine and TMP-SMX, respectively.</p><p>The following oral regimens should be administered for 21 days, and are listed in order of our preference:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trimethoprim-dapsone</strong> &ndash; Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a> is administered at a dose of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (typically rounded to the nearest 100 milligrams) three times per day with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> 100 mg per day. Dapsone is a sulfone that is usually tolerated by persons who have adverse reactions to TMP-SMX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

In general, we do not use this agent for the initial treatment of moderate disease since atovaquone was less effective than <span class=\"nowrap\">TMP/SMX</span> in a comparative clinical trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, we may switch a patient with moderate to severe disease to atovaquone if they are clinically improved on a more potent agent, but have developed an adverse reaction.</p><p/><p>Patients should be tested for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency when using a regimen that contains <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primaquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">primaquine</a> since patients with G6PD deficiency are at risk for developing hemolytic anemia when exposed to these agents. Sulfa-intolerant patients with G6PD deficiency and mild disease should receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atovaquone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atovaquone</a>. For those with G6PD deficiency and moderate disease, the decision to use atovaquone, desensitize to TMP-SMX, or switch to IV therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentamidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentamidine</a> depends upon the severity of their disease and their past reaction to TMP-SMX.

It typically occurs in HIV-infected patients with a CD4 count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> who are not receiving antiretroviral therapy or appropriate prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antimicrobial therapy directed against <em>P. jirovecii</em> is the mainstay of treatment for PCP. In addition, some patients will require adjunctive corticosteroids. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated or resumed to restore cellular immunity. (See <a href=\"#H23513275\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to treatment (eg, the choice of agent, the mode of administration, and the use of adjunctive corticosteroids) is based upon the severity of disease. Patients are classified as having mild, moderate, or severe disease. (See <a href=\"#H549879690\" class=\"local\">'Mild disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H402141829\" class=\"local\">'Moderate disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H549879554\" class=\"local\">'Severe disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe disease, we recommend treatment with intravenous (IV) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX) rather than IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentamidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentamidine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). For individuals with mild to moderate disease, we suggest treatment with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole rather than oral trimethoprim-dapsone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The standard dose of TMP-SMX is 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> (based upon the TMP component) in three or four divided doses. Therapy should be administered for 21 days. (See <a href=\"#H887412817\" class=\"local\">'Preferred regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals with mild to moderate disease who are unable to take TMP-SMX, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primaquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">primaquine</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atovaquone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atovaquone</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Treatment with atovaquone for PCP should preferentially be limited to patients with mild disease, or to complete a course of therapy in patients improving on TMP-SMX who develop an adverse reaction and need to stop it. (See <a href=\"#H23513281\" class=\"local\">'Alternative regimens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe disease who are unable to take TMP-SMX, we suggest clindamycin-primaquine rather than IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentamidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentamidine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, for such patients who cannot take medications orally, pentamidine is the only IV option. If pentamidine is used, patients should be switched to a less toxic regimen as soon as they can tolerate oral therapy. (See <a href=\"#H23513281\" class=\"local\">'Alternative regimens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with moderate to severe disease (eg, a partial pressure of oxygen of &lt;70 mmHg on room air <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an alveolar-arterial (A-a) oxygen gradient of &ge;35 mmHg), we recommend corticosteroids be initiated (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We also administer corticosteroids to patients with clear evidence of hypoxemia (eg, resting room air oxygen saturation &lt;92 percent). Corticosteroids should be administered concurrently with anti-<em>Pneumocystis</em> therapy in this setting to decrease the incidence of mortality and respiratory failure associated with PCP. (See <a href=\"#H23512922\" class=\"local\">'Use of corticosteroids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TMP-SMX is the preferred therapy for PCP in pregnant women. If an alternative therapy must be used, trimethoprim-dapsone can be administered since there is clinical experience with this regimen in pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H1055246759\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be monitored closely for adverse events related to their treatment regimen. Several of the antimicrobial regimens used to treat PCP are associated with significant side effects. A change in regimen may be needed for patients who develop severe adverse reactions (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome with TMP-SMX, pancreatitis, or renal failure with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentamidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentamidine</a>). (See <a href=\"#H23513314\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring patients on treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23513321\" class=\"local\">'Adverse reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who do not show any improvement (eg, tachypnea, hypoxemia) after four to eight days of therapy are considered treatment failures. Treatment failure may be due to the severity of disease at the time of diagnosis or to a concurrent infection that was not previously identified. Although the impact of drug resistance on treatment outcomes has not been established, we modify the treatment regimen for patients failing therapy, especially those with severe disease who do not improve after eight days. (See <a href=\"#H25052109\" class=\"local\">'Treatment failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with PCP who are not receiving ART at the time of their diagnosis, we recommend ART be initiated within two weeks of PCP treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Early ART (versus starting therapy after PCP treatment) can reduce the risk of AIDS progression and death in patients presenting with PCP. (See <a href=\"#H25051059\" class=\"local\">'Timing of ART initiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After completing their initial 21-day course of treatment, patients should continue to receive antimicrobial therapy at a reduced dose to prevent recurrent infection (ie, secondary prophylaxis). Secondary prophylaxis can be discontinued in patients receiving ART if they have an undetectable viral load and a rise in their CD4 count to &ge;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> for at least three months. (See <a href=\"#H887410988\" class=\"local\">'Secondary prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most effective way to prevent PCP is by improving the immune system through use of antiretroviral therapy. Antimicrobial therapy should be administered for prophylaxis while awaiting immune recovery. (See <a href=\"#H2384560850\" class=\"local\">'Preventing initial infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We administer PCP prophylaxis to patients with any of the following characteristics: CD4 count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL;</span> CD4 percentage &lt;14 percent; oropharyngeal candidiasis; or history of an AIDS-defining illness if they have not initiated ART or are <strong>not</strong> virologically suppressed while receiving an ART regimen. Prophylaxis should also be administered to those who have a CD4 count between 200 and 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> when frequent monitoring of CD4 counts is not possible. (See <a href=\"#H2384560868\" class=\"local\">'Indications for antimicrobial prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who meet criteria for PCP prophylaxis, we recommend TMP-SMX rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). For individuals who cannot take TMP-SMX or dapsone, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atovaquone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atovaquone</a> is preferred over aerosolized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentamidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentamidine</a>. We discontinue primary PCP prophylaxis in patients receiving ART if they have an undetectable viral load and a rise in their CD4 count to &ge;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> for at least three months or have prolonged viral suppression and a CD4 count between 100 and 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>.
