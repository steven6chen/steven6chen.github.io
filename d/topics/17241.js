(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-and-treatment-of-thyroid-nodules\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to and treatment of thyroid nodules&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thyroid lymphomas are nearly always of the non-Hodgkin type as Hodgkin lymphoma of the thyroid is exceedingly rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Only approximately 2 percent of extranodal lymphomas arise within the thyroid gland, and lymphomas represent no more than 2 percent of all malignant thyroid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a Danish epidemiologic survey, the annual incidence rate was estimated to be 2.1 per million persons, with a 4:1 female predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Most other retrospective series have confirmed this markedly higher frequency of thyroid lymphoma in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. The mean and median ages at diagnosis are between 65 and 75 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preexisting chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis is the only known risk factor for primary thyroid lymphoma and is present in approximately one-half of patients. Among patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the risk of thyroid lymphoma is at least 60 times higher than in patients without thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/3,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,9</a>]. Worldwide, the frequency of thyroid lymphoma appears to be higher in areas with a higher prevalence of thyroiditis.</p><p>Lymphoma may also occur more commonly after iodine supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There appears to be no clear association between exposure to ionizing radiation and lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], although individual cases have been described. Chromosomal abnormalities are rare in thyroid lymphomas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION AND PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary thyroid lymphoma is almost always of B-cell lineage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/3,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,7</a>]. Occasional patients with T-cell lymphomas have been reported, often in areas endemic for human T-lymphotrophic virus (HTLV)-I-associated adult T-cell <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/lymphoma</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Sixty to 80 percent of thyroid lymphomas are diffuse, large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL of germinal center type) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/4,5,7,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,7,14,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-the-hematopoietic-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of the hematopoietic neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The next most common subtype (approximately 30 percent) is extranodal marginal zone lymphoma. Other less common histologic subtypes include follicular lymphomas; extranodal small lymphocytic lymphomas have also been described. The extranodal marginal zone lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type are generally associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Morphologically, marginal zone lymphomas are characterized by small- to medium-sized centrocyte-like cells, often with plasmacytoid features, associated with reactive germinal centers and lymphoepithelial lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Molecular abnormalities reportedly associated with marginal zone lymphomas (including thyroid) have included a loss of expression of BCL-2 and an increase in p53 inactivation with higher-grade disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Although the pathogenic significance is unknown, Epstein-Barr virus gene expression has been reported in thyroid lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Although several studies report up to 70 to 80 percent of thyroid lymphomas are morphologically of the marginal zone type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/3,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,20</a>], an analysis of small-cell anaplastic tumors of the thyroid from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group found a far lower frequency (&lt;10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Consistent with the concept of thyroid lymphoma as a marginal zone, extranodal lymphoma is a 10 to 60 percent incidence of synchronous or metachronous gastrointestinal tract lymphomas, higher than is typically found in nodal, non-Hodgkin lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In more than 90 percent of patients with thyroid lymphoma, the major symptom is a rapidly enlarging goiter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/3-6,20,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6,20,23</a>]. Many patients have symptoms or signs of tracheal, esophageal, or neck vein compression, including dysphagia, dyspnea, stridor, hoarseness, neck pain, and facial edema. Although these findings are usually present for only a few months, 10 to 20 percent of patients have a longstanding history of goiter, often in association with hypothyroidism.</p><p>In occasional patients, the lymphoma presents as a solitary nodule; some of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas may present as small, slow-growing thyroid masses. Lymphoma of the thyroid should be considered in all patients with a rapidly enlarging goiter, a solitary thyroid nodule, a dominant nodule in a multinodular goiter, and in any patient with Hashimoto's thyroiditis with an enlarging goiter.</p><p>On examination, the thyroid is firm, even hard, may be slightly tender, and is often fixed to adjacent structures and immobile with swallowing. Substernal extension is common. When a distinct intrathyroidal mass is identified, the diameter is typically greater than 5 cm, but often the exact borders of the goiter cannot be defined. Approximately one-half of patients have enlarged cervical or supraclavicular lymph nodes. In patients with hoarseness, laryngoscopy will often reveal vocal cord paresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>In addition to local symptoms and signs, up to 10 percent of patients have systemic (&quot;B&quot;) symptoms of lymphoma, including fever, night sweats, and weight loss (10 percent of body weight or more). Approximately 10 percent of patients have symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism, usually caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis but occasionally due to diffuse infiltration of the thyroid by the lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A few patients have been described with hyperthyroidism caused by tumor-induced thyroid follicular inflammation and destruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], or preexisting Graves' hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no laboratory abnormalities that are either specific to, or diagnostic of, thyroid lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As noted above, some patients have hypothyroidism, and many have high serum concentrations of antithyroid peroxidase or antithyroglobulin antibodies, indicative of Hashimoto's thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/3,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,25</a>]. Approximately 30 percent of patients have high serum concentrations of immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgM, or IgG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>An ultrasound scan of the thyroid gland and needle biopsy or excisional biopsy are usually recommended as initial diagnostic procedures. Ultrasound of the thyroid typically demonstrates pseudocystic, hypoechoic areas that can easily be mistaken for cysts. In one series, thyroid ultrasound showed a characteristic asymmetrical pseudocystic pattern in 43 of 46 patients with thyroid lymphomas (93 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Additional information on the ultrasound appearance of thyroid lymphoma is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-utility-of-ultrasonography-in-thyroid-disease#H22440291\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical utility of ultrasonography in thyroid disease&quot;, section on 'Thyroid lymphoma'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of a diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) can often be established by cytologic examination of material obtained by biopsy techniques. Given the frequent coexistence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, small lymphocytic lymphomas are more difficult to diagnose cytologically, and immunohistochemical staining or flow cytometry may be necessary to establish monoclonality and characterize surface markers (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atlas-of-thyroid-cytopathology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atlas of thyroid cytopathology&quot;</a>). Although the diagnosis of lymphoma may be suggested by the fine needle aspiration initially performed for suspicion of thyroid malignancy, fine needle aspiration cytology is often nondiagnostic for thyroid lymphoma. When the fine needle aspiration biopsy results are suggestive of lymphoma or when the clinical suspicion for lymphoma is high in the presence of a nondiagnostic fine needle aspiration biopsy, subsequent large-bore needle biopsy or excisional biopsy is required in order to obtain sufficient material for definitive diagnosis by immunohistochemical studies, especially since curative treatment is available for some of these non-Hodgkin lymphoma variants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Studies on excised tissue'</a>.)</p><p>Thyroid lymphomas cannot be distinguished from carcinomas or Hashimoto's thyroiditis by radiographic or radionuclide imaging. Difficulty in distinguishing Hashimoto's thyroiditis from lymphoma can be a particular problem using 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging as both can cause diffuse uptake throughout the gland, whereas mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas of the thyroid generally produce false negative PET imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Radioiodine scanning has no diagnostic role in patients with thyroid lymphomas, because the malignant cells lack iodine-concentrating ability.</p><p>Although radiographic studies are not helpful for diagnosis, they are useful in defining the extent of disease, planning therapy, and monitoring the response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are superior to ultrasonography for evaluating local extent because of their greater ability to detect tracheal invasion, substernal extension, and involvement of cervical, mediastinal, or abdominal nodes. MRI may be more sensitive for defining the extent of extrathyroidal invasion, but it costs more, and its superiority is unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. One review of nine cases reported three different appearances on CT (solitary nodule, multiple nodules, diffuse enlargement), with the most common pattern being diffuse enlargement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Another characteristic CT finding is the so-called &quot;donut sign,&quot; observed when the lymphoma completely encircles the trachea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Lugano modifications to the Ann Arbor staging classification is most widely used for primary thyroid lymphoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/25,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,33</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation, staging, and response assessment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>). Based upon this classification:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 50 percent of patients present with disease limited to the thyroid gland, designated stage IE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 45 percent have disease limited to the thyroid and locoregional nodes, classified as stage IIE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only approximately 5 percent have lymphoma in nodal groups on both sides of the diaphragm (stage IIIE) or diffuse organ involvement (stage IV). Among the extranodal sites that have been reported are bone marrow, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, liver, pancreas, and kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/3,14,24,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14,24,34</a>].</p><p/><p>Given these potential sites of involvement, the initial staging work-up for a patient with primary thyroid lymphoma should include, in addition to measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and CT of the neck, the same testing used for non-Hodgkin lymphoma of any site. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation, staging, and response assessment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe airway compromise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe airway compromise may occur in up to 25 percent of patients with thyroid lymphoma, often precipitously due to rapid growth of an aggressive lymphoma variant (eg, diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL]). Such tumors shrink within hours after initiation of combination chemotherapy (eg, rituximab-CHOP [<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>]), due to the rapid effect of the steroid component, potentially obviating the need for tracheotomy. Since such treatment also rapidly modifies tumor histopathology, tissue biopsy should be performed before such agents are started. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Radiation and chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most centers, definitive surgery for thyroid lymphoma is not usually performed, and surgery is utilized for diagnostic biopsy only.</p><p>There is little evidence that thyroidectomy is of value in patients with stage IIE or IIIE thyroid lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/5,6,14,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,14,35,36</a>]. This was illustrated by a report of 62 patients with thyroid lymphoma who were treated with either diagnostic biopsy or debulking surgery, both followed by radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. There was no difference in the rate of complete remission or in cause-specific survival in patients who underwent debulking surgery plus adjuvant therapy compared with those treated with diagnostic biopsy and definitive radiation. In patients with clinical stage IE disease (particularly mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [MALT] lymphomas), surgery may permit the distinction between intrathyroid tumor, which may be treatable by local therapy alone (surgery followed by postoperative radiation), and extrathyroid extension, which appears to require systemic chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Radical procedures that are more likely to injure the recurrent laryngeal nerves or the upper aerodigestive tract or cause hypoparathyroidism should be avoided since they do not improve outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation and chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective treatment of thyroid lymphoma depends upon the tumor type and extent of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/thyroid-lymphoma/abstract/15,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,38</a>].
