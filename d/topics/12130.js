The laparoscopic approach is preferred due to documented physiologic, economic, and cosmetic benefits compared with the open approach. However, when laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not possible or cannot be completed safely, open cholecystectomy is indicated. Open cholecystectomy may also be performed as an integral part of another operation (eg, pancreaticoduodenectomy) or incidentally, if indicated, during another gastrointestinal operation (eg, colon resection).

In patients with asymptomatic gallstones who undergo an abdominal operation, there is a risk of developing symptomatic gallbladder disease within several years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-cholecystectomy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

Other reasons to perform open cholecystectomy preferentially over laparoscopic cholecystectomy are presented below. (See <a href=\"#H24392986\" class=\"local\">'Absolute indications for open surgery'</a> below and <a href=\"#H24392993\" class=\"local\">'Relative indications for open surgery'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24392797\"><span class=\"h3\">Conversion from laparoscopic operation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conversion of the laparoscopic cholecystectomy to an open approach is usually performed to avoid injury to associated structures. This reflects sound surgical judgment and should not be viewed as a failure or complication of the laparoscopic approach. A conversion rate of 9.5 percent of cases was reported in The United States National Hospital Discharge Surveys, which identified one million patients who underwent cholecystectomy from 2000 to 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-cholecystectomy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Similar conversion rates have been reported in other large population-based studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-cholecystectomy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Predictors of conversion to open cholecystectomy include age (OR 1.01 per year, 95% CI 1.01-1.02), male gender (OR 2.40, CI 1.73-3.33), emergency status (OR 1.42, CI 1.09-1.84), serum albumin <span class=\"nowrap\">(-1g/dL)</span> (OR 1.43, CI 1.26-1.62), and previous abdominal surgery (OR 1.64, CI 1.20-2.25) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-cholecystectomy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-cholecystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic cholecystectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, in patients with severe acute cholecystitis, conversion to open surgery does not guarantee good outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-cholecystectomy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Draining the gallbladder with percutaneous cholecystostomy followed by delayed cholecystectomy in medically unfit patients or in those suspected to have severe inflammatory changes in the gallbladder and porta hepatis may be prudent to avoid catastrophic vasculobiliary injuries associated with immediate surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-cholecystectomy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

However, mild elevations have been reported even in the absence of these complications, and may be due to the passage of small stones, sludge, or pus.

ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone extraction is usually therapeutic in patients with choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, and gallstone pancreatitis with stone impaction, and can be used to rule out malignancy. If the ERCP is unsuccessful at clearing the stones, the surgeon should be prepared for an operative common bile duct exploration.

Anatomic variations of the ductal structures include accessory hepatic ducts, a short or nonexistent cystic duct, or a cystic duct that drains into the right hepatic duct. The various configurations of accessory hepatic ducts and variations in cystic and hepatic ducts are shown in the figures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F79551\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79551 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F69483\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69483 \">figure 3</a>). Less common anatomic variants of the ductal anatomy occur in Caroli's disease and Caroli's syndrome. Caroli's disease is a congenital disorder characterized by multifocal, segmental dilatation of large intrahepatic bile ducts. The condition is usually associated with renal cystic disease of varying severity. Caroli initially described two variants, which has led to some confusion in terminology. Caroli's disease is the less common form and is characterized by bile ductular ectasia without other apparent hepatic abnormalities. The more common variant is Caroli's syndrome in which bile duct dilatation is associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis. Caroli's disease and syndrome are discussed in detail elsewhere.

The general principles for performing open cholecystectomy are discussed below and are illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73464\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73464 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1162641\"><span class=\"h2\">Exposing the gallbladder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common approach for open cholecystectomy is through a right subcostal incision, extending obliquely from the midline, parallel to and 2 to 3 cm inferior to the right costal margin. Gallbladder exposure is optimized by completely dividing the right rectus abdominis muscle and incising the linea alba. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incisions-for-open-abdominal-surgery#H3294660\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incisions for open abdominal surgery&quot;, section on 'Subcostal'</a>.)</p><p>In patients undergoing conversion from a laparoscopic approach to an open approach, the subcostal incision can be made by connecting the subxiphoid and medial subcostal port-site incisions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50974\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50974 \">figure 7</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-cholecystectomy#H114901272\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic cholecystectomy&quot;, section on 'Abdominal access'</a>.)</p><p>A midline incision can also provide adequate exposure for open cholecystectomy and is preferred in patients undergoing a concomitant abdominal or pelvic procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incisions-for-open-abdominal-surgery#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incisions for open abdominal surgery&quot;, section on 'Midline incision'</a>.)</p><p>Once the incision is made, moist sponges and retractors are placed (handheld or self-retaining) to retract the hepatic flexure of the colon inferiorly, the duodenum medially, and the liver superiorly. Care is taken to avoid injury to surrounding organs, particularly in the setting of acute or chronic inflammation. Exposure may sometimes be improved by decompressing the gallbladder, which can be performed by making a small incision in the gallbladder fundus, suctioning out the bile and suturing the defect closed to prevent subsequent spillage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H744709095\"><span class=\"h2\">Gallbladder dissection and removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy is most often performed &quot;bottom-up&quot; starting from the infundibulum of the gallbladder, many surgeons perform open cholecystectomy &quot;top-down&quot; starting from the fundus of the gallbladder. The top-down approach frees the gallbladder from the liver first, leaving the cystic duct as the only remaining attachment, which can be divided without requiring dissection more medially, potentially minimizing the likelihood of injury to the portal structures. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1233235781\"><span class=\"h3\">Top-down approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A top-down approach can be a good alternative if there is any uncertainty about the location of the cystic duct and cystic artery in relation to other structures in the hilum of the liver. However, chronic inflammation can tether the gallbladder to the hilar structures and lead to complications with this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-cholecystectomy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A small contracted intrahepatic gallbladder may be indicative of this possibility. Prior to dissecting the gallbladder, it may be useful to identify the cystic duct and artery and doubly loop them with suture or small vessel loops. The fundus of the gallbladder is grasped and retracted away from the liver. The plane between the gallbladder and liver is divided using electrocautery. Dissection is continued until the gallbladder is freed from the liver bed. Any bleeding from the liver bed can usually be controlled with direct pressure or electrocautery. Argon beam coagulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> suture ligation of visible vessels may be useful in some cases, but deep suturing into the liver should be avoided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=instruments-and-devices-used-in-laparoscopic-surgery#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Instruments and devices used in laparoscopic surgery&quot;, section on 'Electrosurgery'</a>.)</p><p>The structures entering the gallbladder are dissected from the surrounding connective tissue and fat, identifying the cystic duct entering the base of the gallbladder and the cystic arteries. The cystic artery or arteries can be ligated close to the gallbladder wall. The cystic duct should be milked toward the gallbladder to remove debris, and then it is ligated. It is not necessary to dissect the cystic <span class=\"nowrap\">duct/common</span> duct junction and, in the setting of severe inflammation or obliteration of tissue planes, it is acceptable to leave some gallbladder attached to the cystic duct. If this option is necessary, the residual gallbladder remnant should be cleared of debris and closed securely. Once the cystic duct has been divided and ligated, the gallbladder is removed from the field. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1233235833\"><span class=\"h3\">Bottom-up approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unequivocal identification of the cystic duct and cystic artery is important for avoiding injury to the portal structures. The cystic duct should <strong>not</strong> be clipped or divided until the surgeon is certain that the putative cystic duct goes directly into the gallbladder, and that there are no other ductal structures coursing between the base of the gallbladder and the liver bed. An &quot;anomalous&quot; cystic duct or cystic artery&nbsp;should <strong>not </strong>be divided until the surgeon is&nbsp;absolutely certain that the structure is not a major duct or artery. If there is any question regarding ductal anatomy, intrahepatic cholangiography should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H1162683\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative cholangiography'</a> below.). </p><p>For a bottom-up approach, retraction and dissection of the gallbladder is similar to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The fundus of the gallbladder is grasped with a clamp and retracted cranially. This helps expose the infundibulum of the gallbladder. The infundibulum is grasped and retracted laterally and inferiorly. With the gallbladder retracted in this manner, the cystic duct and artery will straighten, which facilitates dissection in the triangle of Calot, (bounded by the cystic duct inferiorly, the cystic artery superiorly and the common hepatic duct medially), to obtain the &quot;critical view of safety&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66207\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66207 \">figure 8</a>), which must be achieved prior to clipping or ligating the cystic duct and cystic artery and when accomplished, the structures seen entering the gallbladder can only be the cystic duct and artery, and thus, injury to major structures is avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-cholecystectomy/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. To achieve the &quot;critical view of safety&quot;, a term originally adopted to describe the proper camera view during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the triangle of Calot is dissected free of all connective tissue and fat exposing the cystic duct and cystic artery, and the medial margin of the gallbladder is freed from the liver. It is not necessary to routinely open the peritoneum over the common duct, but the surgeon should be confident about the location of the common duct where the putative cystic duct drains into it. The dissection begins at the level of the infundibulum. The peritoneum over the infundibulum of the gallbladder is bluntly dissected and the peritoneum stripped along the cystic duct. An unusually large cystic duct should prompt the surgeon to re-evaluate the anatomy. Once the cystic duct has been identified with certainty, its contents should be gently &quot;milked&quot; toward the gallbladder and if substantial debris is suspected, a doubly looped silk suture (Pott's tie) can be placed around the cystic duct and held under gentle tension to prevent the debris from passing distally during subsequent gallbladder manipulation, which can lead to postcholecystectomy complications or choledocholithiasis. After the cystic duct has been dissected, the cystic artery, which usually has anterior and posterior branches, is located. The cystic artery branches can often be unequivocally identified entering the gallbladder where they can be ligated prior to freeing the gallbladder from the liver bed. Otherwise, it should be secured with a double loop of silk suture and temporarily occluded while the gallbladder is freed from the liver bed. If there is concern that the structure could be a diminutive right hepatic artery, a vessel loop can be used for temporary occlusion. Once the dissection is completed and the cystic duct and artery have been identified with certainty, they are ligated and the gallbladder removed. </p><p>Dissection of the gallbladder from the liver is accomplished by retracting the gallbladder from the liver and dividing the tissue in the plane between the gallbladder and liver using electrocautery. Any bleeding from the liver bed can usually be controlled with direct pressure or electrocautery. Argon beam coagulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> suture ligation of visible vessels may be useful in some cases, but deep suturing into the liver should be avoided.

These include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrahepatic gallbladder &ndash; Intrahepatic gallbladder can be removed in the usual fashion. Rarely, it is necessary to leave the back wall of the gallbladder on the liver bed to avoid a difficult dissection and excessive bleeding from the liver. In this setting, the mucosa should be obliterated with electrocautery or argon beam coagulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to safely perform cholecystectomy &ndash; If an open cholecystectomy is started and difficulties are encountered, conversion to a cholecystostomy may be useful, provided the gallbladder has not been devascularized.

Once the gallbladder is separated, intestinal defects are usually closed primarily. Fistulous connections to the extrahepatic biliary tree, such as with Mirizzi syndrome, may be adequately managed with T-tube insertion into the biliary defect, but may require ductal reconstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallstone-ileus#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallstone ileus&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirizzi-syndrome#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mirizzi syndrome&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gallbladder cancer &ndash; Gallbladder cancer is rare, but a suspicion may be raised during the course of cholecystectomy. An appropriately trained hepatobiliary surgeon may proceed with extended cholecystectomy or more radical procedure. Those surgeons with less experience can complete the cholecystectomy and await the results of final pathology to determine the next course of treatment, which may be referral to a tertiary center for re-resection.

Ideally, the anatomy should be clarified before any ductotomy is made, but if this is not possible, the ductal opening for the cholangiogram catheter should be small in case what is thought to be the cystic duct turns out to be the common duct or a lobar duct. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Real-time imaging with fluoroscopy is preferred to static radiography. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Glucagon</a> (1 mg intravenously) may be needed to relax the ampulla of Vater to facilitate contrast flow into the duodenum. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H550031\"><span class=\"h2\">Common bile duct exploration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If cholangiography confirms the presence of common bile duct stones and postoperative ERCP with stone extraction is not a likely option (eg, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, prior failed ERCP, lack of local expertise), common bile duct exploration and removal of stones will be necessary. The procedure of common bile duct exploration is discussed in detail elsewhere.

However, it is acceptable to selectively drain the peritoneal cavity after a difficult cholecystectomy, or if there is evidence of residual bile leakage from the liver bed. Drains are not a substitute for adequate hemostasis and cannot be relied upon to indicate the extent of, or the absence of, postoperative hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-cholecystectomy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. When drains are employed, closed suction drains should be used and the drain(s) should be brought through a separate stab wound, rather than through the surgical incision, which may compromise incisional healing. </p><p>Although the subcostal incision is resistant to dehiscence <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> herniation, healing may be compromised by poor technique. When closing the right subcostal incision, most surgeons approximate the fascia in two layers. Care should be taken to ensure incorporation of the appropriate tissue layers lateral to the border of the rectus muscle. Single-layer mass closure is acceptable, particularly when the posterior fascia will not hold suture well. The principles of surgical wound closure are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-abdominal-wall-closure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of abdominal wall closure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1162878\"><span class=\"h1\">OPEN CHOLECYSTOSTOMY TUBE PLACEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To place a cholecystotomy tube, a pursestring suture is placed into the fundus of the gallbladder through which an 18 F balloon catheter (inflated once inside the gallbladder) or mushroom catheter is introduced after making a stab incision within the confines of the pursestring suture. The pursestring suture is drawn up and tied to secure the catheter. The catheter should be brought out of the abdomen through a site separate from the abdominal incision. The gallbladder wall is sutured to the peritoneum where the catheter exits the abdomen. If the gallbladder cannot be brought up to the abdominal wall, the space between the gallbladder and abdominal wall should be buttressed with omentum and closed-suction drains placed. </p><p>The cholecystostomy tube is placed to gravity drainage and should be irrigated with small quantities of sterile saline, as needed. After one week, cholangiography can be performed through the cholecystostomy tube. The cholecystostomy tube can be clamped in two to three weeks, and if tolerated, the tube can be removed one month after placement, provided there is no ongoing need for the tube.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19100129\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE AND FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After an uncomplicated open cholecystectomy, patients can drink clear liquids once awake from anesthesia and their diet can be advanced as tolerated.

If the patient is refractory to anti-emetic medications, the nasogastric tube can be replaced. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-nausea-and-vomiting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative nausea and vomiting&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Following discharge from the hospital, the patient should see the operating surgeon around two and six weeks postoperatively. At these intervals, patients are evaluated for signs and symptoms of infection, biliary complications, and wound problems. Following open cholecystectomy, most patients are feeling quite well at two weeks (minimal narcotic use and improving appetite) and are usually fully recovered at six weeks. Failure to progress accordingly may be indicative of postoperative complications. (See <a href=\"#H19100136\" class=\"local\">'Perioperative morbidity and mortality'</a> below.)</p><p>The patient may develop problems with dyspepsia and possibly persistent abdominal discomfort following gallbladder removal, a constellation of symptoms known as the postcholecystectomy syndrome (PCS).

Compared with laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a study from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database found that patients who underwent open surgery were older with a higher comorbidity burden and had higher rates of mortality (2.8 versus 0.3 percent), infection (8.4 versus 1.3 percent), and other serious complications (11 versus 1.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-cholecystectomy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Complications related to cholecystectomy can be systemic, related to patient comorbidities or anesthetic technique, or related directly to the cholecystectomy. The most common systemic complications are pulmonary in nature. An observational study of 2139 patients who underwent either open cholecystectomy or were converted to open cholecystectomy reported failure to wean off the ventilator after more than 48 hours in 4.7 percent, unplanned intubation in 3.4 percent, pneumonia in 3.6 percent, and pulmonary embolism in 0.3 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-cholecystectomy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Atelectasis and more serious postoperative pulmonary complications can be prevented in some cases by early ambulation, incentive spirometry, and analgesia.

Hemodynamically stable patients may be observed initially; however, postoperative bleeding associated with hemodynamic instability should prompt abdominal exploration. </p><p>Major bile duct injury may be associated with injury to associated vessels, most commonly, the right hepatic artery. In the setting of severe acute or chronic inflammation, inadvertently dissecting the common bile duct can also lead to injury of the portal vein.</p><p>If a major vascular injury is recognized during an open cholecystectomy, primary repair should be performed by an experienced vascular, hepatobiliary, or liver transplant surgeon. Following repair, duplex imaging should be used to confirm patency. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H636462838\"><span class=\"h2\">Bile leak</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bile leak due to major bile duct injury following open cholecystectomy is rare; bile leaks are more commonly related to the liver bed or cystic duct stump. If a major ductal injury is found, in the absence of a surgeon appropriately trained in advanced hepatobiliary surgery, transfer to a tertiary center is appropriate.</p><p>If a drain has been placed during the cholecystectomy procedure, bilious drainage in the postoperative period is obvious. In those patients who have not had a drain placed, a bile leak should be suspected if postoperative progress is delayed. Common symptoms include persistent abdominal pain, ileus, fever, and hyperbilirubinemia. The bile leak may be from the liver bed (duct of Luschka), cystic duct stump (displaced clip or suture), or, rarely, due to an extrahepatic biliary ductal injury. Ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen may show a substantial subhepatic, perihepatic, or, sometimes, free intraperitoneal fluid. The choice of initial postoperative study depends upon the clinical scenario and urgency. Although CT scan of the abdomen shows more detail, abdominal ultrasound is generally quicker to obtain and does not require contrast administration. </p><p>Biliary scintigraphy (technetium labeled hepatic iminodiacetic acid [HIDA] scan) or ERCP can be used to confirm bile extravasation. Major ductal injury (eg, transection of the common bile duct, hepatic ducts) should be suspected on the basis of HIDA scan or ERCP. Worrisome findings include extravasation of isotope and nonvisualization of bowel on HIDA scan, and failure to visualize the proximal common duct or lobar branches on ERCP. If the bowel &quot;lights up&quot; on HIDA scan, this confirms that there is at least partial ductal continuity between the liver and duodenum.

If the severed aberrant duct is left open (Strasberg type C injury), a postoperative bile leak is evident and typically it is refractory to ERCP stenting since there is discontinuity between the leaking duct and the common bile duct.

(See <a href=\"#H24392458\" class=\"local\">'Indications for open surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Open cholecystectomy is typically performed under general anesthesia through a right upper quadrant incision. Open cholecystectomy can be performed using a &quot;top-down&quot; approach, starting from the fundus of the gallbladder, or a &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach, starting from the infundibulum of the gallbladder. Using a &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach, the unequivocal identification of the cystic duct and cystic artery is essential to avoid ductal injuries. The advantage of the &quot;top-down&quot; approach is that it frees the gallbladder from the liver first, leaving the cystic duct and artery as the only remaining attachments for clipping and cutting. However, chronic inflammation can tether the gallbladder to the hilar structures making a &quot;top-down&quot; approach difficult and dangerous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-cholecystectomy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Heightened awareness of this possibility is required when multiple bouts of recurrent inflammation result in an unusually small shrunken gallbladder, and when inflammation is unusually severe. In these situations, the surgeon should consider cholecystostomy or subtotal cholecystectomy. (See <a href=\"#H744709095\" class=\"local\">'Gallbladder dissection and removal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for intraoperative cholangiography during open cholecystectomy include unclear ductal anatomy, jaundice, and stones in the biliary tree suspected by palpation or preoperative imaging. If cholangiography confirms the presence of common bile duct stones and postoperative ERCP is not a likely option, common bile duct exploration and removal of stones will be necessary. (See <a href=\"#H1162683\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative cholangiography'</a> above and <a href=\"#H550031\" class=\"local\">'Common bile duct exploration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following uneventful open cholecystectomy, most patients are feeling quite well at two weeks (minimal narcotic use and improving appetite) and are usually fully recovered at six weeks. Failure to progress accordingly may be indicative of postoperative complications. (See <a href=\"#H19100129\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative care and follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications related to cholecystectomy can be systemic, related to patient comorbidities or anesthetic technique, or related directly to the cholecystectomy. The most common systemic complications are pulmonary in nature. Complications specifically related to the surgical procedure include bleeding, bile leak (which may be related to ductal injury), and infection (surgical site or intra-abdominal). (See <a href=\"#H19100136\" class=\"local\">'Perioperative morbidity and mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bile leak should be suspected in patients who do not progress normally after cholecystectomy. Common symptoms include persistent abdominal pain, ileus, fever, and hyperbilirubinemia. Ultrasound or computed tomography of the abdomen may be used in the initial evaluation of bile leak, and suspected leak confirmed using biliary scintigraphy (HIDA scan) or ERCP. The management of bile leak following open cholecystectomy depends upon the amount and source of the leak. (See <a href=\"#H636462838\" class=\"local\">'Bile leak'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-cholecystectomy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Bragg LE, Thompson JS.
