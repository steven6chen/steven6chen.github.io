This bleeding risk is further increased in any patient receiving chronic anticoagulant therapy. Approximately 5 percent of patients undergoing PCI are treated with long-term oral anticoagulation (OAC) for conditions such as atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, or prior placement of a mechanical heart valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-management-of-antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-receiving-long-term-oral-anticoagulation-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

These risks are also impacted by whether the patient is undergoing an elective or urgent procedure (eg, acute coronary syndrome). </p><p>This topic discusses issues surrounding the periprocedural management of antithrombotic therapy in patients on OAC undergoing PCI. The issues surrounding the care of patients who are candidates for longer-term dual antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulant therapy are discussed separately.

Interrupting anticoagulation for this procedure transiently increases the risk of periprocedural thromboembolism while continuing anticoagulant therapy may increase the risk of periprocedural bleeding. In addition, if the patient has a bleeding complication, the anticoagulant is often discontinued for a variable length of time, resulting in a longer period of increased thromboembolic risk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periprocedural-bleeding-in-patients-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periprocedural bleeding in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is estimated that 5 to 10 percent of patients referred for PCI have a strong indication for long-term anticoagulation, with atrial fibrillation (AF) being the most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-management-of-antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-receiving-long-term-oral-anticoagulation-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. AF patients who undergo coronary stenting are at high risk of adverse events due to frequent comorbidities. In a report of 426 such patients, a major adverse cardiovascular event (death, myocardial infarction, or target lesion revascularization) rate of 32 percent at a median follow-up of 595 days after PCI were seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-management-of-antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-receiving-long-term-oral-anticoagulation-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. All-cause mortality was 23 percent. </p><p>The following are pivotal questions in these patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the need for long-term oral anticoagulation change the choice and timing of oral antiplatelet regimen?

The combination of aspirin and a P2Y<sub>12 </sub>receptor blocker is referred to as dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT); aspirin plus clopidogrel is our preferred combination for patients receiving OAC.

Triple <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prasugrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prasugrel</a> was associated with a greater risk of any Bleeding Academic Research Consortium-defined bleeding events compared with triple-clopidogrel.

Arterial access using the radial artery significantly lowers the risk of access site bleeding and is part of the rationale for not reversing oral anticoagulation (OAC).

Those at relatively high thrombotic risk includes individuals with a prosthetic mitral valve or high CHA2DS2-VASc score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86930\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86930 \">table 1</a>). Risk factors for bleeding include older age, use of the femoral artery for access (compared to the radial artery), ager greater than 75 years, and baseline comorbidities such as anemia and chronic kidney disease.</p><p>After considering the thrombosis and bleeding risks, we hold anticoagulant only for those with a low thrombotic risk and high bleeding risk.

For most patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, we do not routinely reverse its effect with vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma. </p><p>The following are guidelines for when to administer the last preprocedural anticoagulant dose:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients taking non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apixaban</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edoxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edoxaban</a>), we continue therapy until 24 hours before the procedure.

For patients in whom oral anticoagulant (OAC) will be restarted, and assuming no significant postprocedural bleeding has occurred, the next major decision is when to restart OAC. </p><p>The optimal time to restart anticoagulant therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is not known. For most patients, the goal is to restart anticoagulation as soon as possible after PCI. In the absence of evidence to support one approach or another, we suggest the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who did not take their OAC the morning of the PCI, we restart OAC therapy the evening after the procedure in patients without evidence of bleeding, particularly if they have undergone radial artery access. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients treated with a femoral artery approach, it is reasonable to restart a newer OAC the morning following the procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients at very high risk of thrombosis (eg, mechanical heart valves, high CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score) who are taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, we continue therapeutic heparin after the procedure until the international normalized ratio (INR) is therapeutic. The INR should be monitored closely, particularly in the first four weeks after discharge (high-risk period for hemorrhage).

Our recommendations for managing this increase in risk follow. (See <a href=\"#H3412803265\" class=\"local\">'Defining the issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For stable patients, we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> rather any other P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). For patients with acute coronary syndrome, we recommend clopidogrel rather any other P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2119553542\" class=\"local\">'Dual antiplatelet therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, we measure the international normalized ratio (INR) in advance (at least two days) of the procedure. We make adjustments to the warfarin dose to allow the INR to be at the lower end of the target range the morning of the procedure. If it is anticipated that a large sheath will be placed in the femoral artery, we may hold warfarin for longer and allow the INR to fall below 2. We suggest this method rather than allowing return of normal clotting status (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1895234107\" class=\"local\">'Preprocedural anticoagulant management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In most cases, we do not bridge with heparin even if the INR falls below 2. Exceptions include those with very high thrombotic risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients receiving a non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant, we stop the last dose about 24 hours before the procedure in elective cases rather than stopping sooner (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We give intraprocedural heparin to most patients. For patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, we reduce the normal heparin dose if the INR is &gt;2 and reduce it further if it is &gt;2.5. (See <a href=\"#H1004710073\" class=\"local\">'Intraprocedural anticoagulant management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We prefer the radial access in most cases, as it decreases the risk of periprocedural bleeding. If the femoral access has been chosen, we encourage the use of closure devices. (See <a href=\"#H3141680425\" class=\"local\">'Access site'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The timing of restarting OAC depends on factors such as risk of thrombosis off anticoagulant, access site used, and the timing of the last dose of anticoagulant prior to the procedure. For patients who did not take their OAC the morning of the PCI, we restart OAC therapy the evening after the procedure in patients without evidence of bleeding, particularly if they have undergone radial artery access.
