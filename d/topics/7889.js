This is based on the cutoff for reporting bacteriuria that is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infection-in-pregnant-women/abstract/3,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17</a>] and is consistent with obstetric expert opinion. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is associated with decreased rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes, as discussed below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Antibiotic therapy is typically with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, penicillin, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cephalexin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cephalexin</a>. These drugs have not been associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome or teratogenic effects. For patients who have a severe IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to penicillins and cephalosporins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> is the only oral alternative, if the isolate is susceptible.

We do not treat asymptomatic bacteriuria at these counts; it remains a reflection of anogenital colonization and an indication for intrapartum chemoprophylaxis.

Some studies have suggested that treating GBS bacteriuria at any colony count is associated with better pregnancy outcomes, as detailed below. Thus, some practitioners favor treatment as an attempt to prevent the subsequent development of pyelonephritis and to prevent preterm delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infection-in-pregnant-women/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, low colony counts are more likely to reflect contamination from vaginal colonization rather than true bacteriuria, and colonization is not eradicated by antibiotic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infection-in-pregnant-women/abstract/14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19</a>]. We believe the risk of selecting for antimicrobial resistance outweighs the uncertain benefit of treatment of low colony counts.</p><p/><p>Data evaluating the treatment of GBS asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy are limited. In a trial of 69 women with GBS bacteriuria at 27 to 31 weeks of gestation, penicillin treatment at all colony counts reduced rates of preterm labor (5 versus 38 percent) and preterm rupture of the membranes (11 versus 53 percent) compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/group-b-streptococcal-infection-in-pregnant-women/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

In otherwise uncomplicated cases, treatment can be continued with an oral agent (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cephalexin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cephalexin</a>) after resolution of fever and other severe symptoms.</p><p>In the setting of a serious IgE mediated allergy to penicillin and cephalosporins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> should be employed until there is a clinical and microbiological response (ie, negative urine culture). Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> can be used to complete the course of therapy (eg, 10 to 14 days depending on clinical response). Even though clindamycin is not a typical agent for pyelonephritis, it is a reasonable option in this limited situation.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal group B streptococcal disease: Prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GBS is a frequent cause of asymptomatic bacteriuria, cystitis, and pyelonephritis during pregnancy. There is an association between untreated, asymptomatic bacteriuria (independent of the bacterial species) with progression to pyelonephritis, and with low birth weight or preterm delivery. The risk of adverse outcome is decreased with antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Urinary tract'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic GBS bacteriuria in pregnancy is a marker for heavy genital colonization with GBS and, as such, is associated with increased risk of upper genital tract infection and postpartum endometritis. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is identified by screening urine cultures that are obtained during prenatal visits. At least one screening urine culture should be obtained during early pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Urinary tract'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic bacteriuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria with GBS consists of antibiotic therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a>, penicillin, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cephalexin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cephalexin</a>. The recommended duration of therapy is three to seven days. Sterile urine must be documented after treatment, and periodic screening cultures should be obtained throughout the pregnancy to identify recurrent bacteriuria. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic bacteriuria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genital colonization with GBS persists despite adequate therapy for GBS bacteriuria. Women with documented GBS bacteriuria should not be screened for GBS <span class=\"nowrap\">rectal/vaginal</span> colonization later in pregnancy but should be considered persistently GBS colonized and receive intrapartum chemoprophylaxis at the time of delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal group B streptococcal disease: Prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cystitis is diagnosed by a positive urine culture in the clinical setting of urinary frequency, urgency, and dysuria without fever. It is treated with the same oral antibiotic regimens as asymptomatic GBS bacteriuria. A repeat urine culture demonstrating clearance of the organism and periodic repeat cultures for bacteriuria should be obtained. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Cystitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pyelonephritis during pregnancy is diagnosed by a positive urine culture in the clinical setting of fever, urinary symptoms, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting,</span> flank pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> costovertebral angle tenderness. Treatment includes intravenous hydration and intravenous antibiotics. If GBS is identified as the cause of pyelonephritis, treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G</a> may be administered for a total duration of 10 days, tailored to evidence of clinical improvement. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pyelonephritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other infections associated with GBS include intraamniotic infection (chorioamnionitis), endometritis, and bacteremia. Rare peripartum infections include maternal meningitis (both antepartum and postpartum), endocarditis, abdominal abscess, and necrotizing fasciitis. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Intraamniotic infection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Endometritis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Bacteremia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Other infections'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Edwards MS, Nizet V, Baker CJ.
