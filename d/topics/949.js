People with angioedema might have swelling of the face, eyelids, ears, mouth, tongue, hands, feet, or genitals (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73131\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73131 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Some people who get angioedema also get hives. Hives are red, raised patches of skin that are very itchy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79242\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79242 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>Sometimes, people have symptoms of angioedema when they are having a dangerous allergic reaction. <strong>Call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong> if you suddenly have puffiness or hives <strong>plus any of the following</strong>:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tightness in your throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble swallowing your saliva</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cramps or stomach pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passing out</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10516247\"><span class=\"h1\">Why did I get angioedema?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A common cause of angioedema is allergies. If you just got angioedema for the first time, it might be because you have a new allergy to something. Allergies to the following things can cause angioedema:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines (described below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insect stings</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foods, such as eggs, nuts, fish, or shellfish</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Something you have touched, such as a plant, animal saliva, or latex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise</p><p/><p>The medicines that can cause angioedema include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics (usually with hives, trouble breathing, and other symptoms of an allergic reaction)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines used to treat high blood pressure or heart disease called angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (or &quot;ACE inhibitors&quot;) &ndash; Examples include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">enalapril</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">captopril</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">lisinopril</a>. People who get angioedema because of these medicines usually don't have hives or itching.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over-the-counter medicines for pain and fever, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Motrin, Advil), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve)</p><p/><p>Angioedema can also be caused by rare diseases that sometimes run in families. An example is hereditary angioedema. In this disease, people get repeated attacks of angioedema, belly pain, or swelling in the throat. These attacks last 2 to 5 days and then get better. However, the disease is serious because swelling in the throat can cut off the air supply. If you have angioedema and other people in your family do too, you should see a doctor. There is testing and treatment for hereditary angioedema.</p><p>Sometimes, doctors don't know the cause of angioedema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10516264\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for angioedema?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no test for most types of angioedema. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have angioedema by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10516279\"><span class=\"h1\">How is angioedema treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment depends on how serious your symptoms are. If you get angioedema because of a dangerous allergic reaction, you will need to be treated in a hospital right away. At the hospital, the staff will give you treatments to stop the allergic reaction and help your symptoms.</p><p>If your symptoms are mild, you might not need treatment. But you should try to figure out if anything triggered your symptoms. If so, you will need to avoid that trigger.</p><p>Your doctor might recommend that you take medicines called antihistamines. These are the same medicines people take for seasonal allergies.</p><p>Your doctor might also prescribe medicines called steroids. Steroids can help with itching and reduce swelling. But you should not take steroids for any longer than you need them, because they can cause serious side effects. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.</p><p>If you got angioedema because of a medicine you took, your doctor will switch you to a different medicine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10516294\"><span class=\"h1\">Can angioedema be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can lower your chances of getting angioedema by avoiding foods, medicines, or insects that make you have an allergic reaction. If you get angioedema a lot, your doctor might recommend that you take antihistamines every day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10516309\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hives-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hives (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anaphylaxis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-you-should-know-about-antibiotics-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What you should know about antibiotics (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Food allergy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peanut-allergy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Peanut allergy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=insect-bites-and-stings-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Insect bites and stings (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
