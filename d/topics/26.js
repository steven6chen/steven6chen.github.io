It may be underrecognized because it primarily affects patients who are already quite ill and whose organ dysfunction may be incorrectly ascribed to progression of the primary illness. Since treatment can improve organ dysfunction, it is important that the diagnosis be considered in the appropriate clinical situation. The definition, incidence, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome are reviewed here.</p><p>The management of the open abdomen following abdominal decompression is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the open abdomen in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) are distinct clinical entities and should not be used interchangeably.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Intra-abdominal pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) is the steady state pressure concealed within the abdominal cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For most critically ill patients, an IAP of 5 to 7 mmHg is considered normal. In a prospective cohort study of 77 supine hospitalized patients, the IAP averaged 6.5 mmHg and was directly related to body mass index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>The normal range described above is not applicable for all patients. Patients with increased abdominal girth that developed slowly may have higher baseline intra-abdominal pressures. As an example, morbidly obese and pregnant individuals can have chronically elevated intra-abdominal pressure (as high as 10 to 15 mmHg) without adverse sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H264093045\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal perfusion pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) is calculated as the mean arterial pressure (MAP) minus the IAP: APP = MAP - IAP. Elevated intra-abdominal pressure reduces blood flow to the abdominal viscera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Multiple regression analysis has found that APP is better than other resuscitation endpoints such as arterial pH, base deficit, arterial lactate, and hourly urinary output for predicting outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A target APP of at least 60 mmHg is correlated with improved survival from IAH and ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Intra-abdominal hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is defined as a sustained intra-abdominal pressure &ge;12 mmHg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F69364\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69364 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,8</a>]. Although this value was established arbitrarily, it is used in many research studies and distinguishes most patients whose intra-abdominal pressure is inappropriately elevated. Intra-abdominal pressure can be further graded as follows: Grade I = IAP 12 to 15 mmHg; Grade II = IAP 16 to 20 mmHg; Grade III = IAP 21 to 25 mmHg; Grade IV = IAP &gt;25 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperacute IAH refers to elevation of the intra-abdominal pressure lasting only seconds. It is due to laughing, coughing, straining, sneezing, defecation, or physical activity. IAH with ACS due to gastric overdistention following endoscopy has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute IAH refers to elevation of the intra-abdominal pressure that develops over hours. It is usually the result of trauma or intra-abdominal hemorrhage and can lead to the rapid development of ACS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subacute IAH refers to elevation of the intra-abdominal pressure that develops over days. It is most common in medical patients and can also lead to ACS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic IAH refers to elevation of intra-abdominal pressure that develops over months (pregnancy) or years (morbid obesity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It does not cause ACS but does place the individual at higher risk for ACS if they develop superimposed acute or subacute IAH.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal compartment syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For research purposes, ACS is defined as a sustained intra-abdominal pressure &gt;20 mmHg (with or without APP &lt;60 mmHg) that is associated with new organ dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,8</a>]. For clinical purposes, ACS is better defined as IAH-induced new organ dysfunction without a strict intra-abdominal pressure threshold, since no intra-abdominal pressure can predictably diagnose ACS in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>Patients with an intra-abdominal pressure below 10 mmHg generally do not have ACS, while patients with an intra-abdominal pressure above 25 mmHg usually have ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Patients with an intra-abdominal pressure between 10 and 25 mmHg may or may not have ACS, depending upon individual variables such as blood pressure and abdominal wall compliance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F69364\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69364 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/11,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14-16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher systemic blood pressure may maintain abdominal organ perfusion when the intra-abdominal pressure is increased, since the perfusion pressure (APP) is the difference between the mean arterial pressure and the intra-abdominal pressure. (See <a href=\"#H264093045\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal perfusion pressure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal wall compliance initially minimizes the extent to which an increasing abdominal girth can elevate the intra-abdominal pressure. But when a critical abdominal girth is reached, abdominal wall compliance decreases abruptly. Further increases in abdominal girth beyond this critical level result in a rapid rise of intra-abdominal pressure and ACS if untreated. Increased abdominal wall compliance due to chronic increased abdominal girth (eg, pregnancy, cirrhosis with ascites, morbid obesity) may be protective against ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most studies evaluating the incidence of ACS have been performed in trauma patients, with estimates of incidence varying considerably [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. The largest study (n = 706) reported an incidence of ACS of 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In contrast, two smaller observational studies (n = 128 and n = 188) reported an incidence of ACS of 9 to 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The incidence of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is less well characterized.</p><p>The variable estimates do not appear to be related to the definition of ACS because the studies defined ACS similarly. ACS was considered present if there was persistent IAH, progressive organ dysfunction despite resuscitation, and improvement following decompression.</p><p>The different estimates likely relate to the different patient populations studied. The largest study enrolled all patients with trauma who were admitted to an intensive care unit. The smaller studies enrolled patients with major torso trauma (flail chest, two or more abdominal injuries, major vascular injury, complex pelvic fracture, or two or more long bone fractures), an early arterial base deficit (&ge;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L),</span> and either an age &ge;65 years or the need for transfusion of &ge;6 units of packed red blood cells. These different enrollment criteria suggest that the incidence of ACS is highest among the most critically ill patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ACS generally occurs in patients who are critically ill due to any of a wide variety of medical and surgical conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18</a>]. Some of these include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trauma &ndash; Injured patients in shock who require aggressive fluid resuscitation are at risk for ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burns &ndash; Patients with severe burns (&gt;30 percent total body surface area) with or without concomitant trauma are also at risk for ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Importantly, ACS must be distinguished from other intra-abdominal problems that occur in these critically ill patients (eg, necrotizing enterocolitis, ischemic bowel).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver transplantation &ndash; A prospective cohort study found intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH; intra-abdominal pressure [IAP] &gt;25 mmHg) following liver transplantation in 32 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal conditions &ndash; Massive ascites, abdominal surgery, or intraperitoneal bleeding can increase intra-abdominal pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retroperitoneal conditions &ndash; Retroperitoneal pathologies, such as ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA), pelvic fracture with bleeding, and pancreatitis, can lead to abdominal compartment syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. In a systematic review, the pooled rate of ACS following rAAA was 8 percent; among those who developed ACS, nearly one-half died. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical illness &ndash; Conditions that require extensive fluid resuscitation (eg, sepsis) and are associated with third spacing of fluids and tissue edema can increase intra-abdominal pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-surgical patients &ndash; Patients undergoing operations in which they are given large volume resuscitation, particularly with crystalloid in the face of hemorrhagic or septic shock, are at risk for ACS.</p><p/><p>ACS can be classified as primary or secondary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Primary ACS is due to injury or disease in the abdominopelvic region (eg, abdominal trauma, hemoperitoneum, pancreatitis); intervention (surgical or radiologic) of the primary condition is often needed. Secondary ACS refers to conditions that do not originate in the abdomen or pelvis (eg, fluid resuscitation, sepsis, burns).</p><p>The development of secondary ACS is often related to the need for and extent of volume resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Careful attention needs to be paid to the amount of fluid being administered, and alterations in fluid management may be needed in patients who are exhibiting early <span class=\"nowrap\">signs/symptoms</span> of ACS. The fluid management of hypovolemic patients is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic support'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of inpatient management in the adult trauma patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following trials illustrate the correlation between fluid administration and ACS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One trial randomly assigned 71 patients with severe acute pancreatitis to rapid fluid expansion or controlled fluid expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The rapid expansion group received significantly greater volumes of crystalloid (4028 versus 2472 mL) and colloid (1336 versus 970 mL) on the day of admission with no differences after four days.

It is simple, minimally invasive, and accurate (additional pressure is not imparted from its own musculature). Because differences in recorded intravesical pressure occur with varying head position, care must be taken to ensure consistent head and body positioning from one measurement to another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/74-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-76</a>]. </p><p>Commercial products are available to simplify measurement; however, bladder pressure measurement can be performed with supplies routinely available in the intensive care unit using the following steps (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56661\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56661 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The drainage tube of the patient's Foley (bladder) catheter is clamped.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sterile saline (up to 25 mL) is instilled into the bladder via the aspiration port of the Foley catheter and the catheter filled with fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An 18-gauge needle attached to a pressure transducer is inserted into the aspiration port.

Surgical decompression of the abdominal cavity is considered definitive management (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F101881\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101881 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>Some exceptions include escharotomy release to relieve mechanical limitations due to burn scars and percutaneous catheter decompression to relieve tense ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/83-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-85</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H264091950\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive care and temporizing measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of supportive care in patients with intra-abdominal hypertension include reduction of intra-abdominal volume through avoidance of positive fluid balance after initial resuscitation, evacuation of intraluminal contents, evacuation of intra-abdominal space-occupying lesions (eg, ascites, hematoma) when possible, and measures to improve abdominal wall compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>]. </p><p>Nasogastric and rectal drainage is a simple temporizing means for reducing intra-abdominal pressure in patients with bowel distension. However, bowel distention alone is not a likely cause of ACS. </p><p>Hemoperitoneum, ascites, intra-abdominal abscess, and retroperitoneal hematoma occupy space and can elevate intra-abdominal pressure. In cases where ACS and chronic ascites coexist, there may be a role for paracentesis as a temporizing measure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. In one study, percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) avoided the need for subsequent open abdominal decompression in 81 percent of patients treated. However, failure to drain at least 1000 mL of fluid and decrease intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) by at least 9 mmHg in the first four hours postdecompression was associated with failure and the urgent need for open abdominal decompression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. </p><p>Attention should be paid to patient positioning, and the patient should be placed in a supine position since elevation of the head of the bed (&gt;20&deg;), which is commonly used to reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia, increases intra-abdominal pressure, and also impacts the measurement of intra-abdominal pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Measurement of intra-abdominal pressure'</a> above.)</p><p>Abdominal wall compliance can be improved with adequate pain control and sedation, but for some patients, chemical paralysis will be needed to achieve abdominal wall relaxation and ventilatory support will be indicated.

Some clinicians prefer to use colloids under this circumstance; however, although there are accumulating data that large-volume crystalloid resuscitation for shock can lead to ACS, it is not clear that substituting colloid offers any protection, and once the patient develops ACS, the treatment is decompression and the type of fluid is of no consequence.</p><p>For patients with ACS, volume administration temporarily improves cardiac output, renal blood flow, urine output, and visceral perfusion and negates some of the negative effects of positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP), but compartment syndrome cannot be treated by administration of fluid (regardless of type). Also, there is no role for diuretic therapy in the resuscitation of patients with ACS even though central venous and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures are usually elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. The only appropriate management is to open the abdomen.

However, a precise threshold for surgical decompression has not been established. Various approaches include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical decompression for all patients whose intra-abdominal pressure is greater than 25 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many clinicians suggest surgical decompression at a lower intra-abdominal pressure (eg, 15 to 25 mmHg), based on their belief that surgical decompression performed at an intra-abdominal pressure lower than 25 mmHg is associated with improved organ perfusion, patient outcome, and prevention of ACS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other clinicians believe that the need for surgical decompression should be determined by the pressure gradient for abdominal perfusion, also called the abdominal perfusion pressure (APP). As described above, the APP is the difference between the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the intra-abdominal pressure (IAP; APP = MAP - IAP). In a retrospective study, an APP below 50 mmHg predicted mortality with greater sensitivity and specificity than either the mean arterial pressure or the intra-abdominal pressure alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>Most surgeons perform decompression and then maintain an open abdomen using temporary abdominal wall closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Maintenance of an open abdomen using temporary abdominal wall closure requires dressings that bridge the fascial edges while preventing evisceration, retaining fluid, and retaining heat. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the open abdomen in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Percutaneous decompression of the peritoneal cavity can be effective and is a less invasive technique for treating patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">IAH/ACS</span> where free intraperitoneal fluid or blood is present as determined by bedside ultrasonography. Failure to drain at least 1000 mL of fluid and decrease IAP by at least 9 mm Hg in the first four hours following decompression is associated with failure and should prompt urgent surgical decompression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. </p><p>Surgical decompression can be performed in the operating room if the patient is medically stable for transfer or at the bedside in the intensive care unit.

In some patients, delayed primary closure of the abdominal fascia is possible once edema subsides. However, if closure is premature, abdominal compartment syndrome can recur. Techniques for temporary abdominal closure and timing of closure are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults#H632146314\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the open abdomen in adults&quot;, section on 'Temporary abdominal closure'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Failure to recognize intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) prior to the development of ACS causes tissue hypoperfusion, which may lead to multisystem organ failure, and potentially death. The effect of decompressive laparotomy on outcomes in patients with abdominal compartment syndrome is not well studied. Although the development of IAH alone is not a predictor of multiorgan failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>], mortality for patients who have progressed to ACS is high, ranging from 40 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/11,14,93-96\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14,93-96</a>]. </p><p>One prospective study measured intra-abdominal pressure in all patients admitted to the intensive care unit and requiring a bladder catheter. Of the 83 patients studied, 33 percent developed intra-abdominal hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Logistic regression identified maximal intra-abdominal pressure as a significant predictor of mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.17 95% CI 1.05-1.3), which remained significant after adjusting with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II; OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06-1.25) and comorbidities (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.27-5.67). </p><p>Another prospective cohort study included 33 adult patients who underwent decompressive laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. The overall 28-day mortality rate was 36 percent, which increased to 55 percent at one year. Nonsurvivors tended to be older and more required mechanical ventilation compared with survivors. Median intra-abdominal pressure was 23 mmHg (range: 21 to 27 mmHg) before decompressive laparotomy, decreasing to 12 mmHg two hours after decompression, a level that was sustained thereafter. Oxygenation and urinary output were significantly improved. Although survivors showed improvement in organ function scores, nonsurvivors did not.
