Normally, the stomach sits below the diaphragm, the layer of muscle that separates the organs in the chest from the organs in the belly. The esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach, passes through a hole in the diaphragm. In people with a hiatal hernia, the stomach pushes up through that hole, too.</p><p>There are 2 types of hiatal hernia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F78791\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78791 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sliding hernia &ndash; A sliding hernia happens when the top of the stomach and the lower part of the esophagus squeeze up into the space above the diaphragm. This is the most common type of hiatal hernia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paraesophageal hernia &ndash; A paraesophageal hernia happens when the top of the stomach squeezes up into the space above the diaphragm. This is not very common, but it can be serious if the stomach folds up on itself. It can also cause bleeding from the stomach or trouble breathing.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12373461\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a hiatal hernia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hiatal hernias do not usually cause symptoms. In some cases, though, hiatal hernias cause stomach acid to leak into the esophagus. This is called acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux, and it can cause symptoms, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning in the chest, known as heartburn</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning in the throat or an acid taste in the throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stomach or chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble swallowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A raspy voice or a sore throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained cough</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12373468\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for hiatal hernia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, but doctors do not usually test for hiatal hernia. Instead, most people learn they have a hiatal hernia when they are having tests to find the cause of symptoms, or for other reasons. For instance, some people find out they have a hiatal hernia when they have an X-ray. Others find out when their doctor puts a tube with a tiny camera down their throat (called an endoscopy) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75392\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75392 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12373475\"><span class=\"h1\">How are hiatal hernias treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who have symptoms caused by a hiatal hernia can get treated for their symptoms.</p><p>Treatment for symptoms involves taking the medicines that are used for acid reflux (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F78918\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78918 \">table 1</a>). People with a paraesophageal hernia, and some people with a sliding hernia, need surgery. For this surgery, the surgeon pulls the stomach back down and repairs the hole in the diaphragm so the stomach does not slide up again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12373542\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
