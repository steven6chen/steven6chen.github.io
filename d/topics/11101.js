It is a bacterial infection caused by six species in the spirochete family <em>Borreliaceae</em>. The taxonomy of these spirochetes is undergoing revision, and the genus name may be represented as either <em>Borrelia</em> or <em>Borreliella</em>. In either case, the abbreviation for the genus is &quot;B&quot; and stands for both terminologies in the discussion below. </p><p>In<em> </em>North America, infection<em> </em>is caused primarily by <em>B. burgdorferi</em> and, less commonly, in a region of the upper mid-West, by <em>B. mayonii. </em>In Europe and Asia<em>, </em>infection is caused primarily by either <em>B. afzelii</em> or <em>B. garinii</em>, less commonly by <em>B. burgdorferi</em>, and rarely by <em>B. spielmanii</em> or <em>B. bavariensis</em>.</p><p>In nature, the reservoirs for these organisms are small mammals and birds, not deer. Humans acquire the infection from the bite of an infected tick of the genus <em>Ixodes</em>. The infection begins in the skin at the site of the tick bite. From there, the spirochetes may disseminate in the blood to other tissues and organs. The usual manifestations of Lyme disease involve the skin, joints, heart, and nervous system.</p><p>The microbiology of Lyme disease will be reviewed here. Issues related to immunopathogenesis, epidemiology, prevention, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and therapy of Lyme disease are discussed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunopathogenesis-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunopathogenesis of Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-a-tick-bite-for-possible-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of a tick bite for possible Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-clinical-manifestations-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lyme disease: Clinical manifestations in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3342719386\"><span class=\"h1\">CHARACTERISTICS OF SPIROCHETES THAT CAUSE LYME DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H342592157\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification and genome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spirochetes that cause Lyme disease are motile, spiral bacteria that are only distantly related to gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. Spirochetes have two cellular membranes like gram-negative bacteria, but their flagella, the organelles of motility, are uniquely located between the inner and outer membrane, rather than on the surface. <em>B. burgdorferi</em> is 8 to 30 microns in length and about 0.2 microns in width. Their narrowness accounts for the inability to see unstained or Gram-stained spirochetes by standard light microscopy. (See <a href=\"#H620492271\" class=\"local\">'Culture and staining'</a> below.)</p><p>The genomes of <em>B. burgdorferi </em>and the other five species of Lyme disease agents comprise small linear chromosomes of approximately 1000 kb, and up to 21 linear and circular plasmids totaling another 400 to 500 kb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. These spirochetes were originally classified as members of the genus <em>Borrelia</em>. A new genus name, <em>Borreliella</em> (&quot;borrelia-like&quot;), has been proposed to distinguish the spirochetes that cause Lyme disease from those that cause relapsing fever (which retain the genus <em>Borrelia</em> affiliation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of relapsing fever&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The genus name <em>Borreliella</em> also replaces the less formal designation of &quot;<em>Borrelia burgdorferi </em>sensu lato,&quot; which refers to a cluster of species that are closely related to <em>B. burgdorferi</em>. Several species classified under the &quot;sensu lato&quot; name are not associated with any human disease. <em>B. burgdorferi</em> itself has commonly been distinguished in the literature from other &quot;sensu lato&quot; species by appending &quot;sensu stricto,&quot; as in &quot;<em>B. burgdorferi</em> sensu stricto.&quot;</p><p>Although this new classification scheme has been formally accepted for the taxonomy of Lyme disease agents and closely related species, it remains to be seen if this new genus name achieves wide usage. The medical term &quot;borreliosis&quot; still applies in either case. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H342592788\"><span class=\"h2\">Borrelia proteins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some <em>B. burgdorferi</em> antigens that are encoded by genes on the chromosome are important for diagnostic tests (eg, Western blots). These include flagellin (the major structural protein of flagella, with an apparent size by electrophoresis of 41 kDa), certain heat shock proteins (eg, a 60 kDa protein), an inner membrane protein of 39 kDa, an integral outer membrane protein of 66 kDa, and proteins with apparent sizes 58 kDa and 93 kDa of unknown function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-lyme-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Serologic testing'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, a unique feature of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> and other Lyme disease species is the large number of nucleotide sequences that it contains for lipoproteins with covalently linked fatty acids at their N-terminal ends [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Plasmid-encoded antigens include surface-exposed lipoproteins outer surface protein (Osp) A (31 kDa), OspB (34 kDa) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], OspC (23 kDa) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], the decorin-binding proteins A and B (18 kDa) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and the VlsE protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The spirochete up- or down-regulates expression of some of these proteins at different times in its life cycle, presumably to suit each environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and because of pressure from the immune response of the mammalian host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Not all of the proteins are expressed in cultured organisms. For example, VlsE, a major immunogen, is poorly expressed in culture. Therefore, VlsE is produced as a recombinant protein in <em>Escherichia coli</em> for its use for immunodiagnostic assays. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-lyme-disease#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Single step VlsE C6 ELISA'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-lyme-disease#H185419008\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Addition of a VlsE C6 antigen band to the Western blot of traditional two-tier testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H620492271\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture and staining</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct detection of the organism can be difficult and is of limited value for diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Culture &ndash; Few clinical or public health laboratories perform cultures for <em>B. burgdorferi</em> and related species. Given their small genomes, <em>B. burgdorferi</em> and the other species have limited biosynthetic capabilities and require a complex medium for growth under microaerophilic conditions in vitro. Spirochetes have been isolated from skin, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid, as well as from ticks and various animals, in Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly medium or related formulations that contain multiple nutrients as well as bovine albumin and rabbit serum. However, under the best of circumstances, growth is slow, with generation times of six hours or longer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staining &ndash; The spirochetes can be visualized with silver stains or by immunofluorescence in biopsies of affected skin, although the numbers of bacteria are low. Unlike <em>B. burgdorferi</em>, <em>B. mayonii </em>appears to reach higher numbers in blood, and therefore, it can also be detected in Wright- or Giemsa-stained smears of blood taken during acute infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H439683379\" class=\"local\">'Diversity of Lyme Disease species'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The most commonly performed direct detection assay is polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but the paucity of organisms in tissues and the disappearance of the organism from the blood within two to four weeks of infection onset limit its utility. A more detailed discussion of PCR testing is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-lyme-disease#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Polymerase chain reaction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8868578\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Borrelia</em> species do not produce potent toxins, but cause infection by migrating through tissues, disseminating in the blood, adhering to host cells, and evading immune clearance. There are no data showing that <em>B. burgdorferi</em> has a prolonged intracellular phase in vivo or an intracellular phase that is not treatable by antibiotics. </p><p>Under adverse conditions, the membranes of spirochetes may become detached from underlying cell walls, and the resultant spherical cells may be observed. These so-called &quot;cyst&quot;-like forms do not represent a different stage in a life cycle of the spirochetes, and there is no proven clinical significance for these structures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8868658\"><span class=\"h2\">Ecologic niche</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Borrelia</em> species are obligate parasites; there are no known free-living forms. The spirochetes cycle between two different environments: the tick (a poikilothermic invertebrate without an adaptive immune system), and mammals and birds (homeothermic vertebrates with well-developed adaptive immune systems). They are transmitted primarily by ticks, or very rarely by direct contact with fresh infected blood or tissues, but not by respiratory secretions, urine, feces, or fomites. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p><em>Borrelia</em> species are microaerophilic and grow optimally in carbon dioxide concentrations typical of the internal milieu of mammals and birds. These bacteria are killed by exposure to temperatures over 50&deg;C for more than a few minutes, hypotonic or hypertonic environments, drying, common disinfectants (eg, bleach), and detergents. They do not form spores or other dormant states. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In comparison with genomes of free-living bacteria, the small <em>Borrelia</em> genome encodes few proteins with biosynthetic activity. Thus, <em>Borrelia</em> species depend upon the animal host or a rich culture medium in the laboratory for most nutritional requirements. (See <a href=\"#H620492271\" class=\"local\">'Culture and staining'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8868665\"><span class=\"h2\">Protein expression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>B. burgdorferi</em> expresses different repertoires of proteins to suit each environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. To transit from the tick midgut (where the <em>B. burgdorferi</em> are located prior to initiation of feeding) to the tick salivary gland, the organism rapidly down-regulates outer surface protein (Osp) A protein and upregulates OspC protein. Down-regulation of OspA facilitates detachment from the tick midgut and transit to the salivary glands. Upregulation of OspC facilitates invasion of bacteria into skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Additional discussions of outer surface proteins are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H342592788\" class=\"local\">'Borrelia proteins'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunopathogenesis-of-lyme-disease#H489178\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunopathogenesis of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Outer surface protein variations'</a>.)</p><p>Although <em>Borrelia </em>species do not produce lipid A-containing endotoxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], they do produce lipoproteins that are ligands for toll-like receptors on mononuclear blood cells and other cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Binding to these receptors can lead to release of pro-inflammatory cytokines with effects qualitatively similar to responses to endotoxin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunopathogenesis-of-lyme-disease#H490030\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunopathogenesis of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Toll-like receptors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H439683241\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some surface-exposed lipoproteins, such as OspC, appear to be T-cell independent antigens in hosts. This would explain the antibody responses to OspC during early infection that are limited to IgM and short-lived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Because <em>B. burgdorferi</em> do not secrete toxins, proteases, or other destructive molecules, the majority of the symptoms seen with human Lyme disease are due to the combined effects of the host innate and adaptive immune responses and lytic release of inflammatory bacterial components that follow. This is discussed in detail separately.

However, there is sufficient sequence similarity for some proteinaceous antigens of the Lyme disease group of species and the relapsing fever group of species for there to be antigenic cross-reactivity in immunoassays. Included in this group of relapsing fever agents is <em>B. miyamotoi</em>, which is transmitted by the same species of <em>Ixodes</em> ticks that transmit Lyme disease in North America and Eurasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The organism is transmitted by <em>I. scapularis</em> ticks. </p><p>In northern California, and some other coastal and foothill regions of far-western North America, human cases of Lyme disease are associated with exposure to <em>B. burgdorferi</em>-infected <em>Ixodes pacificus</em> ticks. <em>I. pacificus</em> are infected with <em>B. burgdorferi, </em>but at a 10-fold lower frequency than occurs in the northeastern United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>The only other species that has been established as a cause of Lyme disease in North America is <em>B. mayonii</em>, which<em> </em>is also transmitted by <em>I. scapularis</em> ticks in north-central United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. <em>B. mayonii</em> has not been observed in <em>I. pacificus</em> ticks. <em>B. mayonii</em> has been distinguished from <em>B. burgdorferi</em> by its ability to achieve higher concentrations in the blood in some patients.

Unlike North America and western Europe, where most infections are acquired from the bite of a nymphal tick, in Asia and Asian Russia, transmission to humans is mainly by the adult stage of the tick [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p>Other species, such as <em>B. spielmanii</em> and <em>B. bavariensis</em>, have also been implicated in human disease in Europe or Asia.

As an example, although all three species have been recovered from various sites in patients (eg, skin, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid), infection with <em>B. afzelii</em> is associated with a lower risk of neurologic disease than infection with either <em>B. garinii</em> or <em>B. burgdorferi</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In addition, <em>B. burgdorferi </em>strains from Europe and the United States differ genetically, and the clinical disease caused by <em>B. burgdorferi</em> in Europe is more like that associated with <em>B. afzelii</em> and <em>B. garinii,</em> rather than <em>B. burgdorferi</em> in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

As an example, we have not observed reinfection in patients with Lyme arthritis who typically have expanded antibody responses to many spirochetal proteins that persist for years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Risk of dissemination</strong> &ndash; Some strains of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> are associated with a higher frequency of disseminated infection in humans and other mammals compared with others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/37-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-42</a>]. Moreover, RST1 strains have been associated with more severe early disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>] and more frequent antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. However, the basis for these strain differences is not known. Whether identification of the strain of an infection will lead to more effective management of the patient (eg, a longer course of antibiotics for some strains) has not been evaluated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inflammatory potential</strong> &ndash; Strains of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> from the United States and Europe were found to differ in their inflammatory potential. In general, United States strains generally elicit higher levels of cytokines and chemokines associated with innate and Th1-adaptive immune responses than strains from Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p>Strain typing by DNA sequence (genotyping) has been by outer surface protein C<em> </em>gene (a noncoding region of the chromosome), or a set of conserved chromosomal genes. However, these methods are being supplanted by whole genome sequencing. (See <a href=\"#H3342719386\" class=\"local\">'CHARACTERISTICS OF SPIROCHETES THAT CAUSE LYME DISEASE'</a> above.). </p><p>There are some strains of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> in the United States that occur in all three regions where the microbe is endemic: the Northeast, Midwest, and Far West. One of these is strain B31, which was the first laboratory isolate of this pathogen, and one of the most common. Other strains have more limited distributions (eg, occurring in the Midwest but not in the Northeast or the Far West) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. A similar situation characterizes populations of <em>B. afzelii</em> and <em>B. garinii</em> in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>The mix of strains in a given area is probably determined in part by the adaptive immune responses, including strain-specific antibodies, of host animals over time. There may also be strain differences in host associations, such as different patterns of susceptibility to complement of various vertebrate species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Susceptibility of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> to the nonimmune, bactericidal effects of the serum of lizards is one of the explanations for the lower prevalence of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> in <em>Ixodes</em> ticks in the far-western and southeastern United States. Although lizards are common hosts for <em>I. pacificus</em> and <em>I. scapularis</em> ticks in these respective regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], when an infected tick feeds on a lizard, the blood meal has a sterilizing action. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunopathogenesis-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunopathogenesis of Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H342592214\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in the United States, Canada, and Europe. It is a bacterial infection caused by six species in the spirochete family <em>Borreliaceae</em>. The taxonomy of these spirochetes is undergoing revision, and the genus name may be represented as either <em>Borrelia</em> or <em>Borreliella</em>. (See <a href=\"#H1776078715\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lyme disease spirochetes are motile, spiral bacteria that are only distantly related to gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. Their genomes comprise small linear chromosomes and linear and circular plasmids. (See <a href=\"#H342592157\" class=\"local\">'Classification and genome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct detection of the organism can be difficult. Given their small genome, <em>B. burgdorferi</em> and the other species have limited biosynthetic capabilities and require a complex medium and microaerophilic conditions for growth in vitro. Under the best of circumstances, growth is slow. The spirochetes can be visualized with silver stains or by immunofluorescence in biopsies of affected skin; however, the numbers of bacteria are low. (See <a href=\"#H620492271\" class=\"local\">'Culture and staining'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>B. burgdorferi</em> and related species do not produce toxins, but cause infection by migrating through tissues, adhering to host cells, and evading immune clearance. (See <a href=\"#H8868578\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In<em> </em>North America, infection<em> </em>is caused primarily by <em>B. burgdorferi. </em>In Europe and Asia<em>, B. burgdorferi</em> is less common, and infection is caused primarily by either <em>B afzelii</em> or <em>B. garinii. </em>(See <a href=\"#H1554126762\" class=\"local\">'Geographic distribution'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biologic differences have been observed between different species of Lyme disease agents and among strains within a given species. These are likely to account for some of the differences in clinical manifestations in patients in Europe compared with North America. (See <a href=\"#H439683075\" class=\"local\">'Relationship to clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microbiology-of-lyme-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Stanek G, Reiter M.
