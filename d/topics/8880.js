It makes the breast look red and swollen. The skin can also have pits or dimples. These can make the skin look like the skin on an orange.</p><p>Breast cancer happens when normal cells in the breast change and grow out of control. In a person with IBC, this can happen very quickly.</p><p>IBC is a serious form of breast cancer. It gets worse quickly. It can spread easily to other parts of the body. A person with IBC should get treatment right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11051844\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of IBC are different from other forms of breast cancer. For example, it might not cause a lump in the breast.</p><p>Symptoms of IBC include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin changes. These can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Skin that feels warm or hot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Color changes &ndash; Skin looks pink, red, or purple.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Thicker skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dimples or pits on the skin &ndash; This can look like the skin on an orange.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nipple changes. These can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Flat nipple</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nipple that turns red</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A crust or blister on the nipple</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nipple that points in (if it pointed out before)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Painful, swollen breast</p><p/><p>Having these symptoms does not necessarily mean you have IBC. Other conditions, including infection and other types of breast cancer, can cause similar symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11051859\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if you have any of the symptoms above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11051874\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for inflammatory breast cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will order a special kind of X-ray called a &quot;mammogram.&quot; This is a test for breast cancer. It is done on both breasts.</p><p>The doctor or nurse will do an exam and learn about your symptoms. This can help find IBC. It can also show if something else, such as an infection, is causing the symptoms. Your doctor might prescribe antibiotics as a first step. If your breast symptoms don't improve with the antibiotics, there is a higher chance that cancer could be causing your symptoms.</p><p>If your doctor thinks you might have IBC, you will probably have another test called a &quot;biopsy.&quot; During a biopsy, a doctor takes one or more small samples of tissue. These samples can be from:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The breast</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The skin on the breast</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lymph nodes &ndash; These are small, bean-shaped organs that are part of the body's infection-fighting system.</p><p/><p>A biopsy will confirm whether or not you have IBC. If you have IBC, the doctor might order imaging tests to see if the cancer has spread. These imaging tests might be a CT, bone scan, or other imaging tests. Imaging tests create detailed pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11051889\"><span class=\"h1\">How is inflammatory breast cancer treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with IBC have the following treatments:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. If a person has IBC, doctors give these medicines before surgery or radiation therapy. The medicines can shrink the cancer. If the medicines shrink the cancer enough, the person is usually treated with surgery to remove the breast (called a &quot;mastectomy&quot;) and the lymph nodes under the arm. If the medicines do not shrink the cancer enough, the next steps might include other kinds of chemotherapy or radiation therapy, then followed by an operation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mastectomy &ndash; Mastectomy is surgery to remove the whole breast. A &quot;modified radical mastectomy&quot; also removes lymph nodes. This helps doctors take out as much cancer as possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells. Most people with IBC have radiation after chemotherapy and surgery. Sometimes, if there was not a good response to the chemotherapy, radiation is done before the operation.</p><p/><p>Some forms of breast cancer grow in response to hormones. The doctor might give you treatments to block hormones or prevent your body from making them. Also, some types of breast cancer make too much of a certain protein called &quot;HER2.&quot; These cancers are also treated with drugs that block the action of HER2.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11051904\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, you need to be checked as often as the doctor says. IBC often comes back after treatment. The doctor will check to see if it comes back.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11051921\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Breast cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-breast-problems-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Common breast problems (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=locally-advanced-and-inflammatory-breast-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Locally advanced and inflammatory breast cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=breast-cancer-guide-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Breast cancer guide to diagnosis and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-breast-problems-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Common breast problems (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
