The posttransplant period has been divided into three stages: the first month post-transplant, one to six months post-transplant, and more than six months post-transplant.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the early posttransplant period, bacterial infections predominate. During the first month, there are two major causes of infection:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infection derived from either the donor or recipient</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infectious complications of the transplant surgery and hospitalization</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>From one to six months post-transplant, patients are most at risk for opportunistic infections, although residual problems from the perioperative period can persist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than six months post-transplant, most patients are receiving stable and reduced levels of immunosuppression. These patients are subject to pneumonia caused by an extended range of bacteria, including pneumococcus, gram-negative bacilli, <em>Legionella</em>, and other common pathogens rather than opportunistic infections.</p><p/><p>The pattern of infection seen during these periods is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection in the solid organ transplant recipient&quot;, section on 'Timing of infection posttransplantation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION FOR INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation for infection in lung transplant recipients should follow the general approach used in all solid organ transplant recipients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection in the solid organ transplant recipient&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and management'</a>.)</p><p>Several unique considerations apply to lung transplant recipients in whom pneumonia is the most common type of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Some lung transplant recipients with pneumonia present with fever, cough, dyspnea, and infiltrates on chest imaging. However, some patients have few or atypical symptoms due to the blunting of the immune response by immunosuppressive drugs. In addition, the presentation of infection often overlaps with that of allograft rejection; thus, a high index of suspicion for both infection and rejection should be maintained to ensure early appropriate diagnosis and therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-acute-lung-transplant-rejection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of acute lung transplant rejection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1627022190\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since pneumonia is the most common type of infection in lung transplant recipients, the diagnostic evaluation generally includes early and aggressive evaluation of the lungs as a potential source. Lung transplant recipients can deteriorate quickly in the absence of appropriate therapy. Thus, a reasonable approach to the lung transplant patient with respiratory symptoms involves initial empiric treatment for infection while awaiting microbiologic and histopathologic data. The specific organisms targeted by the empiric regimen depend upon the patient's risk factors and clinical presentation. (See <a href=\"#H1627022723\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>After initiation of empiric antimicrobial therapy and imaging with a chest radiograph, invasive diagnostic testing should be considered in most lung transplant recipients unless contraindications exist. In addition, chest computed tomography may be helpful in patients when a pulmonary infection is uncertain based on clinical history, exam, and chest radiographs alone.</p><p>Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage is the most sensitive diagnostic study to identify the etiology of pulmonary infections and rule out atypical etiologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70685\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70685 \">table 1</a>). Due to the similar clinical presentation, we normally perform transbronchial biopsies at the same time to rule out rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, it is possible that infection and rejection may coexist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1627022209\"><span class=\"h1\">BACTERIAL INFECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacterial infection is the most common early infectious complication after lung transplantation and remains a leading cause of death throughout the posttransplant period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition to pneumonia, lung transplant recipients are at risk for other types of bacterial infections including empyema, bloodstream infection, and wound infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1627022221\"><span class=\"h2\">Sites of infection</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1627022228\"><span class=\"h3\">Pneumonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk for the development of bacterial pneumonia is influenced by both donor and recipient factors, and the risk is highest during the early posttransplant period. Despite antibiotic prophylaxis, the incidence of bacterial pneumonia is approximately 10 to 20 percent in the first 30 days post-transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In a prospective multicenter study of pneumonia in lung transplant recipients, 40 of 85 episodes of pneumonia (44 percent) occurred during the first 30 days following transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Early posttransplant pneumonias are typically caused by hospital-acquired bacteria, including multidrug-resistant <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, Enterobacteriaceae, and methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, microbiology, and diagnosis of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bacterial infections can be transmitted from the donor or develop in the setting of the posttransplant intensive care unit admission. Although approximately 60 percent of donor lungs are colonized, only 6 to 12 percent of recipients develop active infection transmitted from the donor lungs if they receive appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. The detection of certain bacteria from the donor lung(s) warrants additional antibacterials beyond the usual period of perioperative prophylaxis, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H13586165\" class=\"local\">'Routine perioperative prophylaxis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13586136\" class=\"local\">'Positive donor lung cultures'</a> below.)</p><p>Later in the time course (especially more than six months post-transplant), lung transplant recipients are also at risk for developing pneumonia from community-acquired bacterial pathogens. In addition, the risk for infection with multidrug-resistant bacteria remains elevated due to the transplant recipient's frequent exposure to healthcare facilities and increased use of antibacterial agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and microbiology of community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-microbiology-and-diagnosis-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, microbiology, and diagnosis of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the usual community-acquired and hospital-acquired pathogens, lung transplant recipients are at increased risk for pneumonia with bacteria that are typically nonpathogenic in the immunocompetent host, such as <em>Mycoplasma hominis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and <em>Nocardia</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>], and, for fungal pneumonia, most commonly caused by <em>Aspergillus fumigatus</em>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fungal-infections-following-lung-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fungal infections following lung transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at a significantly higher risk of pneumonia compared with other lung transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/9,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,18</a>] and are more likely to be colonized with multidrug-resistant <em>P. aeruginosa</em> and <em>Burkholderia cepacia</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Despite a decreased bacterial burden after removal of the native lungs, patients with CF are at high risk of posttransplant infection due to the potential for contamination of the bloodstream and the thoracic cavity during transplantation. Furthermore, these patients remain at increased risk for infection post-transplant because the native upper airways and sinuses of CF patients retain the chloride channel defect and remain persistently colonized with the pathogens that were present pre-transplant, particularly <em>P. aeruginosa</em> and <em>B. cepacia</em>. (See <a href=\"#H1627022286\" class=\"local\">'Pseudomonas aeruginosa'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1627022308\" class=\"local\">'Burkholderia cepacia'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathogenesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudomonas-aeruginosa-pneumonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1627022241\"><span class=\"h3\">Pleural space infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reaccumulation of pleural fluid after the initial posttransplant chest tube removal can occur due to hemorrhage, rejection, or infection. Pleural fluid accumulation that worsens beyond the first few days following transplantation warrants immediate investigation to exclude empyema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Empyema occurs in 3 to 5 percent of lung transplant recipients; almost all of these infections occur during the first six months after transplantation, with 40 percent occurring within the first month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parapneumonic-effusion-and-empyema-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parapneumonic effusion and empyema in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The incidence of pleural space infections does not appear to be dependent on underlying lung disease or surgical procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/21,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23,24</a>]. However, case reports show an increased incidence of pleural space infections due to <em>B. cepacia</em> in patients with cystic fibrosis who harbor this organism pre-transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In a study of pleural space infections in 36 lung transplant recipients, the most common causes were fungi (in 61 percent) and bacteria (in 31 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. No bacterial species predominated; there were two cases each of <em>B. cepacia</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, and <em>Mycoplasma hominis</em>, and one case each of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Enterococcus </em>spp, <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, <em>Serratia marcescens</em>, and <em>Roseomonas </em>spp. <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em>, which rarely causes pneumonia, has been reported as a cause of empyema in a lung transplant recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The short-term mortality of lung transplant recipients with empyema has been estimated to approach 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1627022254\"><span class=\"h3\">Bloodstream infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in lung transplant recipients.

Risks for BSI include the use of central venous catheters, mechanical ventilation, and cystic fibrosis. BSIs in transplant recipients reflect the pattern of bloodstream infections in immunocompetent hospitalized patients and are most frequently due to <em>S. aureus</em>, <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, <em>Enterococcus </em>spp, and <em>Candida </em>spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In another prospective multicenter study, pulmonary and vascular catheter infections accounted for 47 and 41 percent of all BSIs after lung transplant, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The lungs were the predominant source of BSIs in the first year post-transplant, whereas vascular catheters predominated as the source after one year. Resistant gram-negative bacteremia was more likely with underlying pneumonia and in patients with cystic fibrosis.

The same nosocomial pathogens that cause early posttransplant bloodstream and lung infections (eg, <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, <em>S. aureus</em>, <em>Candida </em>spp) are the most common causes of wound infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. <em>P. aeruginosa</em> is of particular concern in patients with cystic fibrosis due to pretransplant colonization with this organism and the risk for perioperative seeding of the surgical wound.

While the safety of lung transplantation in patients colonized with multidrug-resistant pathogens has been a matter of controversy since the beginning of lung transplantation, an increasing number of studies has shown acceptable survival for lung transplantation in patients colonized with multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria prior to transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>].

A shorter course is reasonable when less virulent bacteria are detected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H162322\"><span class=\"h3\">Positive native lung cultures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients colonized pretransplant with multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as <em>P. aeruginosa</em> or <em>B. cepacia</em>, aggressive antimicrobial prophylaxis with multiple agents from different classes is administered during the posttransplant period. The specific regimen depends upon the resistance patterns of the individual patient's isolates. Durations of IV antibiotics of two to three weeks are typical for most infections excluding <em>B. cepacia</em>, which requires a longer duration. (See <a href=\"#H1627022308\" class=\"local\">'Burkholderia cepacia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1627022286\" class=\"local\">'Pseudomonas aeruginosa'</a> above.)</p><p>As discussed above, <em>B. cenocepacia</em> is associated with significantly worse posttransplant survival compared with CF patients not colonized with this organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-43</a>]. For this reason, colonization with <em>B. cenocepacia</em> is considered a relative contraindication to transplantation and is generally performed only at a limited number of transplant centers with experience managing such patients. (See <a href=\"#H1627022308\" class=\"local\">'Burkholderia cepacia'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1627022761\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjunctive strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adjunctive approaches to systemic antibiotics include inhaled antimicrobial agents and removal of potential infectious reservoirs. While the role of inhaled antibiotics such as aminoglycosides has not been rigorously studied, the potential to decrease colonization of the allograft with minimal systemic toxicity may be an appealing strategy in patients at high risk for multidrug-resistant organisms, such as <em>Pseudomonas</em> and <em>Burkholderia</em> spp.</p><p>The use of inhaled aminoglycosides in addition to systemic therapy is often used for patients with cystic fibrosis or other septic lung disease in which patients are known to be colonized with gram-negative bacteria prior to transplant. Inhaled aminoglycosides are also frequently used post-transplant for multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections in any host.</p><p>Other prophylactic measures include clearance of the bacterial reservoir in the sinuses of patients with CF or other ciliary function defects. The sinuses serve as a major reservoir for bacterial pathogens in patients with CF. There are conflicting data regarding whether pretransplant sinus surgery decreases the incidence of bacterial colonization of the lungs, tracheobronchitis, or pneumonia after lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. The American Society of Transplantation therefore does not recommend routine pretransplant surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Central venous catheters should be removed as early as possible post-transplant to limit the risk of bloodstream infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1627022774\"><span class=\"h1\">VACCINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prevention of infection is of paramount importance to the lung transplant recipient. Infection in these patients results in excessive morbidity and mortality, and antimicrobial therapy is often less effective than in the immunocompetent host. Although immunization appears to be an obvious way to prevent infection, many immunocompromised patients are unable to mount protective immune responses.</p><p>Lung transplant candidates often have to wait unpredictable periods before a suitable donor is available. This waiting period should be used to maintain or boost antibody concentrations for all age-, exposure history&ndash;, and immune status&ndash;appropriate vaccines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F91883\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91883 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-infections-following-lung-transplantation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

In particular, patients with CF are often colonized with such gram-negative bacteria as <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and <em>Burkholderia cepacia</em>, both of which are frequently multidrug resistant. (See <a href=\"#H1627022279\" class=\"local\">'Specific pathogens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients suspected of having bacterial pneumonia should be treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics, taking into account prior infections and colonization as well as other likely potential pathogens, including methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>(MRSA), <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, other gram-negative bacilli, and atypical bacteria (eg, <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>, <em>Legionella</em> spp). The treatment duration in lung transplant recipients with uncomplicated bacterial pneumonia should generally be two weeks. (See <a href=\"#H604798\" class=\"local\">'Pneumonia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend perioperative antibacterial prophylaxis for all lung transplant recipients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>).

For patients without septic lung disease who have an uncomplicated course following transplantation, we typically continue systemic antibacterial prophylaxis for 72 hours.
