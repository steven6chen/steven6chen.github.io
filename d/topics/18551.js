This may be due in part to excess vascular (arterial) calcification (VC), particularly coronary artery calcification (CAC), which can be observed even in very young dialysis patients, who lack the typical vascular damage risk factors of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Calcium can be deposited into either or both of the medial or intimal layers of the vasculature.</p><p>The epidemiology, detection, and clinical significance of VC for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are discussed in this topic review. The definition, pathogenesis, and molecular biology of VC are discussed separately.

The Horus study revealed atherosclerosis in 34 percent of mummies from four geographical regions or populations that spanned over 4000 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In ancient times, the prevalence of atherosclerosis may have been due not only to dietary factors, but also to chronic infection-inflammation. Calcification may be considered a classical response to injury to the endothelium and smooth muscle layers.</p><p>The prevalence of VC among patients with CKD, especially those on dialysis, is extremely high. The prevalence is generally the highest among individuals with lower estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs), and it is assumed that, as GFR falls, the prevalence and severity of VC rise. The prevalence of VC detected by computed tomographic (CT) scanning is &gt;80 percent among dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/1-3,7-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,7-22</a>]. The reported prevalence among CKD patients who are not on dialysis is 47 to 83 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/21,23-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23-28</a>].</p><p>Whereas among patients with reduced eGFR &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, calcification is more prevalent, more severe, and progresses at a faster rate than in the general population, among patients who have GFR &ge;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> who have moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called &quot;microalbuminuria&quot;), the risk is the same as among patients without CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>Some concern has been raised that the high prevalence and severity of VC among CKD patients is in part iatrogenic, for example, caused by the administration of calcium-containing phosphate binders used to treat hyperphosphatemia. However, VC was a frequent feature of patients with CKD prior to the availability of calcium-containing phosphate binders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

It is possible that the increasingly high prevalence is as a result of patient phenotypic drift (older, frailer, more often diabetic), changes in practice patterns in relation to chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD), and better paradigms and technologies for assessment and quantification of VC. It is very likely that there are multiple risk factors associated with VC in the CKD population.

This was demonstrated in a comprehensive systematic review of 30 studies over a period of 20 years that showed that age and length of time on dialysis therapy were the main factors associated with VC among patients with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In one study, VC was seen in 39 percent of patients starting dialysis and in 92 percent after a mean period of 16 years on dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. More severe VC was associated with increased patient age and dialysis vintage. In another study that included 364 skeletal radiographic surveys in 152 CKD patients, VC was observed in 30 and 50 percent of patients aged 15 to 30 and 40 to 50 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43339841\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperphosphatemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most experts believe that a raised plasma phosphate (constant or episodic) with intermittent, episodic, or permanent hypercalcemia drives the initiation and progression of VC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In one study that included 39 young dialysis patients, the serum calcium-phosphate product was higher among patients with coronary artery calcification (CAC) compared with dialysis patients without CAC (65 versus 56 mg<sup>2</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/dL<sup>2</sup>)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

It can be difficult accurately to individualize patient exposure and risk.</p><p>Only one study has actually measured calcium kinetics among CKD patients. This was a well-conducted randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study that examined the effect of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> administration on calcium and phosphate balance in eight CKD patients with a mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 15 to 59 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Subjects received a controlled diet with either a calcium carbonate supplement (1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> calcium) or placebo during two three-week balance periods. Fasting blood and urine were collected at baseline and at the end of each week. All feces and urine were collected during weeks 2 and 3 of each balance period.</p><p>An oral and intravenous calcium isotope (<sup>45</sup>CaCl<sub>2</sub>) was administered to determine calcium kinetics. Patients were in neutral calcium and phosphorus balance while on the placebo. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Calcium carbonate</a> supplementation caused a positive calcium balance and had no effect on phosphorus balance. In addition, compared with placebo, calcium carbonate supplementation produced a small reduction in urine phosphorus excretion.</p><p>Calcium kinetics demonstrated positive net bone balance. However, the amount of calcium that was deposited in bone was less than the overall positive calcium balance, suggesting that some degree of soft-tissue deposition occurred. Fasting blood and urine biochemistries of calcium and phosphate homeostasis were unaffected by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a>, suggesting that it is futile to rely solely on blood concentrations to determine mineral excess or accumulation.</p><p>The interpretation of these data may be limited by the short-term nature of the study. It is possible that patients were not in steady state after only one week of calcium administration. If so, the short-term positive calcium balance may be appropriate to correct years of bone calcium depletion and may decrease over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>However, despite possible limitations in interpretation due to the short-term nature, this study cautions against the reflex prescription of calcium as an oral phosphate binder in CKD. It is simply not known whether a safe lower threshold of administration exists for calcium-containing oral phosphate binders and whether such a threshold is patient specific or generalizable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease#H169682201\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Specific treatment'</a>.)</p><p>As noted above, the use of large amounts of calcium-containing phosphate binders in the setting of poorly controlled hyperphosphatemia may directly enhance VC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2,15,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15,40</a>]. The potential impact upon VC of using calcium as a phosphate binder was assessed in 39 young dialysis patients (mean age 19 years) who underwent electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) to detect CAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients were compared with 60 age-matched controls. CAC was much more common in the patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (88 versus 5 percent in controls). Among the dialysis patients, the clinical features that distinguished the group with CAC from those without such calcification included increased age (26 versus 15 years), duration of dialysis (14 versus 4 years), serum calcium-phosphorus product (65 versus 56 mg<sup>2</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/dL<sup>2</sup>),</span> and daily dose of oral calcium (6456 versus 3325 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>. However impressive the changes were, it has been pointed out that the dose of calcium was not corrected for body size, a potentially important variable in growth-retarded teenagers. Moreover, the serum concentrations of calcium alone and phosphorus alone were not significantly different between the two groups. Based upon this study, it is therefore unclear whether increased duration of dialysis, independent of calcium intake, enhanced the risk of arterial calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Such risk-factor interactions are likely.</p><p>The detrimental effects of calcium-based oral phosphate binders on VC have led to the search for non-calcium-containing compounds that can bind phosphate (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease#H169682201\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Specific treatment'</a>). </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevelamer-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sevelamer</a> is a cationic polymer that binds phosphate through ion exchange.

A baseline EBCT image was obtained in 186 individuals, which was followed by EBCT CAC and aortic calcification data among 132 subjects at 6, 12, and (in some patients) 24 months. At one year, although serum phosphate control was similar with both agents, compared with sevelamer, calcium-based phosphate binders were associated with a higher incidence of hypercalcemia, an increased incidence of low parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and increased VC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Subsequent analysis found that increased serum concentrations of calcium, phosphate, and the calcium-phosphate product were associated with increased calcium scores in the group that received calcium-based phosphate binders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Among those with CAC at dialysis initiation, more rapid and more severe increases in calcification were observed with calcium-containing phosphate binders at 12 and 18 months, as assessed by EBCT. Patients on sevelamer were also more likely than those on calcium-containing phosphate binders to show stabilization or regression in CAC at 12 months.</p><p/><p>The interpretation of both studies is limited by the fact that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevelamer-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevelamer</a> also has other effects not shared by calcium-containing phosphate binders, including lipid lowering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3,44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,44-46</a>] and reductions in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, uric acid levels, and oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In the Treat to Goal Study, for example, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels decreased by approximately 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/3,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,44</a>]. In another large study, sevelamer reduced LDL-C levels by 30 percent and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels by 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Any or all of these alternative mechanisms, in combination with the avoidance of hypercalcemia, may have contributed to the amelioration of progression of VC in the Treat to Goal study. These properties cannot be assumed to be present in other non-calcium-containing phosphate binders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hyperphosphatemia-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By comparison, the CARE-2 trial found similar progression of CAC with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevelamer-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevelamer</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium acetate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The CARE-2 trial was a randomized, controlled, noninferiority trial in which 203 hemodialysis patients with serum phosphorus levels greater than 5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> LDL-C levels greater than 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> and VC assessed by means of EBCT were randomly assigned to calcium acetate or to sevelamer for 12 months.

After 12 months, mean increases in CAC scores were 35 versus 39 percent in the calcium-acetate and sevelamer groups, respectively. The conclusion of this trial was that, if lipids are lowered to a similar degree, there is no difference between calcium acetate and sevelamer on progression of CAC.</p><p>Among nondialysis CKD patients, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevelamer-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevelamer</a> has also been associated with decreased VC.

The CAC score was assessed by CT at study entry and after 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Among patients that had VC at baseline, regression occurred in more patients treated with sevelamer compared with calcium carbonate (24 versus 2, respectively). By 24 months, new VC developed in fewer patients treated with sevelamer compared with calcium carbonate (5 versus 45, respectively).</p><p>A small study performed in 2012 has also necessitated a reappraisal of the role of all oral phosphate binders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

This is in agreement with the 2009 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-calcification-in-chronic-kidney-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The 2009 KDIGO guidelines suggest that some patients, such as those with significant hyperphosphatemia or potential transplant recipients, may warrant evaluation for VC. However, we do not screen patients with significant hyperphosphatemia for VC, since documenting VC does not change our approach to therapy for such patients. If clinicians thought that the abandonment of the administration of calcium-containing oral phosphate binders to CKD patients with VC prevented further VC, then screening for VC might then be justified as this intervention is clinically achievable. The evaluation of potential transplant recipients is discussed elsewhere.

However, it is not known whether intimal or medial calcification both contribute to increased mortality. It is possible that extensive vessel wall calcium in a plaque may help to stabilize the lesion and reduce the chance of rupture (which would make sense if the development of calcification were a response to vessel injury).

Nevertheless, altering oral phosphate binder strategy can change net calcium balance, as can altering dialysate bath calcium concentrations for CKD patients on dialysis.

Most experts believe that a raised plasma phosphate with intermittent, episodic, or permanent hypercalcemia drives the initiation and progression of VC. (See <a href=\"#H1062042112\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The possible detrimental effects of calcium-based oral phosphate binders on VC have led to the search for non-calcium-containing compounds that can bind phosphate. There may be less progression of VC with these agents compared with calcium-containing phosphate binders, although studies are neither comprehensive nor conclusive. However, it has also not yet been shown that a reduction in progression of calcification is associated with improved patient survival.

Common methods for screening for and quantifying VC include plain radiography, which is the easiest to perform; echocardiography (for heart valves); and computed tomography (CT).
