Diarrhea that lasts &gt;14 days is &quot;persistent&quot; or &quot;chronic.&quot; Diarrhea that recurs after seven days without diarrhea is &quot;recurrent.&quot;</p><p>Acute viral gastroenteritis is caused by a viral pathogen.

Among symptomatic children, the clinical manifestations include diarrhea, vomiting, fever, abdominal cramps, anorexia, headache, and myalgia. The constellation of findings varies by age, with young infants having less specific signs, from day to day and from person to person. Children may have only diarrhea or vomiting at first but with progression can become sufficiently ill to require hospitalization.

Acute viral gastroenteritis is caused by a viral pathogen. (See <a href=\"#H521298956\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute viral gastroenteritis occurs throughout the year with a fall and winter predominance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80471\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80471 \">table 1</a>). It can be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers as well as by symptomatic patients before the onset of symptoms. It is generally transmitted by the fecal-oral route. (See <a href=\"#H79609944\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common causes of acute viral gastroenteritis in children include rotavirus, norovirus, sapovirus, astrovirus, and enteric adenoviruses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80471\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80471 \">table 1</a>). Mixed viral infections are common, but the clinical significance of coinfection with multiple viruses is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among symptomatic patients, the clinical manifestations include diarrhea, vomiting, fever, abdominal cramps, anorexia, headache, and myalgia. The constellation of symptoms varies from day to day and from person to person. (See <a href=\"#H521299938\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute viral gastroenteritis may be complicated by dehydration, electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, carbohydrate intolerance, and irritant diaper dermatitis. Acute viral gastroenteritis that requires medical attention for dehydration occurs predominantly in young children, particularly those younger than two years.

(See <a href=\"#H597660779\" class=\"local\">'History and examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory evaluation is not usually necessary but may be warranted in children who require intravenous hydration for severe dehydration or have an atypical presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F103390\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103390 \">table 5</a>), or if conditions other than acute viral gastroenteritis cannot be excluded clinically. (See <a href=\"#H521300153\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of acute viral gastroenteritis is made by the characteristic history of diarrhea that does not contain gross blood or mucus; with or without vomiting, fever, or abdominal pain; and the absence of findings more characteristic of bacterial or parasitic gastroenteritis, extraintestinal infections, or noninfectious conditions associated with diarrhea and vomiting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F103390\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103390 \">table 5</a>).
