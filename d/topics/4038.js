AITL can be associated with autoimmune phenomena including hemolytic anemia, vasculitis, polyarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and thyroid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/13,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,17</a>]. Cold agglutinins and cryoglobulins can also be seen. These autoimmune features are thought to stem from immune dysregulation of both B cells and T cells, which together result in immunodeficiency and risk of opportunistic infections both before and during treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGIC FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Morphology</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Growth pattern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Involved lymph nodes demonstrate partial or complete effacement of the normal architecture by a predominantly paracortical infiltrate of atypical lymphoid and inflammatory cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Follicles may be hyperplastic, depleted, or absent. Peripheral sinuses are typically open or even dilated, and the abnormal infiltrate usually does not extend beyond the capsule into perinodal tissue.</p><p>There is prominent neovascularization with arborizing high endothelial venules (HEV), many of which show thickened or hyalinized walls (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86422\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86422 \">picture 1</a>). This can be particularly well appreciated with a Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) stain. Clusters of epithelioid histiocytes and numerous eosinophils and plasma cells may be present. Expanded aggregates of follicular dendritic cells, best appreciated in sections immunostained for dendritic cell markers, surround the proliferating blood vessels, and may have the appearance of &quot;burned-out&quot; germinal centers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Cell morphology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The infiltrating lymphoid cells are a mixture of small lymphocytes, immunoblasts, polyclonal plasma cells, eosinophils, histiocytes, epithelioid cells, and medium-sized cells with round or irregular nuclei and moderately abundant clear cytoplasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86423\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86423 \">picture 2</a>). In the past, this polymorphous mixture of cell types was interpreted to be a reactive process (angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy with dysproteinemia). As the lesion progresses, cells with clear cytoplasm increase in number and efface the lymph node. In most cases, these clear cells are closely associated and intermingled with the expanded follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network. B immunoblasts may be numerous in areas between the FDCs and often harbor Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The malignant T cells and the background reactive component most often fail to penetrate beyond the lymph node capsule, but infiltration into the perinodal fat is sometimes seen. B immunoblasts that are EBV positive are sometimes very prominent and occasionally give rise to secondary EBV positive diffuse large B cell lymphomas. Occasionally, binucleated or multinucleated cells that resemble the Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells of Hodgkin lymphoma may be observed. These RS-like cells are usually EBV-positive and may be akin to similar appearing cells that are found on occasion in lymph nodes of patients with infectious mononucleosis. The inflammatory background that is characteristic of true Hodgkin lymphoma is absent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone marrow involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone marrow involvement in angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) usually takes the form of paratrabecular and interstitial polymorphous infiltrates containing cytologically atypical lymphocytes mixed with histiocytes and eosinophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The lymphomatous infiltrate in some marrow specimens contains numerous small or scattered large B cells, resembling either benign lymphoid aggregates or T cell rich large B cell lymphoma. Secondary changes such as trilineage hyperplasia and polyclonal plasmacytosis are frequent and present independent of marrow involvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunophenotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AITL tumor cells appear to be the malignant counterparts of an unusual subset of CD4-positive follicular T helper cells. The tumor cells express pan T cell antigens (ie, CD3, CD2, and CD5) and almost always CD4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86424\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86424 \">picture 3</a>). Many reactive CD8 expressing T cells are often present. An expanded follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network expressing CD21, CD23, and CD35 is usually present, often in areas where malignant T cells with abundant pale cytoplasm are seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86425\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86425 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. This feature is useful in distinguishing this disorder from other T cell lymphomas, which do not contain expanded populations of FDCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The malignant T cells frequently express CD10, CXCL13, PD-1, and BCL6, markers that are expressed by normal follicular T helper cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22,23</a>]. As an example, in one study, CD10 positive T cells were found in 27 of 30 cases of AITL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In contrast, no CD10 positive T cells were present in 10 cases of other peripheral T cell lymphomas or 10 cases of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. Single cell studies indicated that the CD10 positive cells belonged to the neoplastic clone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T cell receptor genes are rearranged in 75 to 90 percent of cases; immunoglobulin heavy chains may be rearranged in up to 25 percent, corresponding to the secondarily expanded Epstein-Barr virus-positive B cell clones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24</a>]. Human herpes virus-6 (HHV6) genomes also are detected in many cases and may be present in either T or B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p>Many genetic abnormalities have been reported, but there is no single cytogenetic change that is typical or diagnostic of AITL. The most common cytogenetic abnormalities are trisomy 3, trisomy 5, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an additional X chromosome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,28</a>]. There is also an unusually high incidence of subclones with distinct chromosomal aberrations; the mechanism underlying the apparent genomic instability is unknown. Gene expression profiling demonstrates a pattern similar to that expressed by follicular helper T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/5,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,29</a>].</p><p>Of interest, among peripheral T cell lymphomas, AITL is particularly likely to have mutations in the genes <em>TET2, IDH2, DNMT3A, </em>and<em> RHOA</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. In one study, <em>TET2</em> mutations were identified in 40 of 86 AITLs (47 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], while a second study identified <em>IDH2</em> mutations in 20 to 45 percent of AITLs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Unlike in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), <em>IDH2</em> mutations preferentially occur at R172 and coexist with <em>TET2</em> mutations more frequently than in AML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The pathogenic significance of these mutations in AITL is uncertain, but it is of interest that mutations in the same genes in myeloid neoplasms lead to changes in DNA methylation and appear to increase the self-renewal capacity of hematopoietic stem cells. AITL may originate from mutated hematopoietic stem cells (rather than peripheral T cells) because B cells from patients with AITL often contain the same <em>TET2</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <em>DNMT3A</em> mutations as are found in AITL cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. <em>RHOA</em>, a gene that encodes a small GTP-binding protein, is mutated in roughly one-half to two-thirds of cases, often in association with <em>TET2</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. A single point substitution, a glycine to valine substitution in residue 17 in <em>RHOA</em>, dominates in AITL, the functional importance of which remains to be determined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes#H4008903\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) is best made by excisional tissue biopsy, most commonly a lymph node interpreted in the context of the clinical presentation. Lymph node evaluation includes assessment of the morphology and immunophenotyping, which are essential to make the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55385\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55385 \">table 1</a>). In difficult cases, PCR-based tests to look for the presence of clonal T cell receptor rearrangements can be helpful.</p><p>As described above, tissue sections reveal effaced nodal architecture, prominent arborizing high endothelial venules, and a polymorphous infiltrate including reactive lymphocytes, immunoblasts, plasma cells, inflammatory cells, and small to large atypical lymphocytes that are positive for CD3 and CD4. Many cases also are positive for markers that are expressed by normal T follicular helper cells, such as BCL6, CD10, CXCL13, and PD-1. As with other peripheral T cell lymphomas, the tumor cells may lose a subset of pan-T cell markers and exhibit an aberrant immunophenotype. Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) are inconspicuous in routinely stained sections, but immunohistochemical staining for markers such as CD21 usually demonstrates irregularly shaped expansions of these cells.</p><p>When clusters of atypical T cells with abundant clear cytoplasm are present, they are typically found within the expanded FDC network. In most cases, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive B immunoblasts, best detected by in situ hybridization for small nuclear EBV RNAS (EBERs), are present in areas between the FDCs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=virology-of-epstein-barr-virus#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Virology of Epstein-Barr virus&quot;, section on 'EBER-1 and EBER-2'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Other peripheral T cell lymphomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) and other peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCLs) typically express pan T cell associated antigens (ie, CD3, CD2, and CD5) and demonstrate T cell receptor gene rearrangements. AITL is distinguished from most other PTCLs by expression of BCL6, CD10, CXCL13 and PD-1 and the presence of expanded meshworks of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) expressing CD21, CD23, and CD35. FDCs are not expanded in other PTCLs.</p><p>In the 2016 revision of the WHO classification, the category of peripheral T cell lymphoma includes two provisional entities in addition to AITL that, like AITL, appear to share an origin from T follicular helper cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follicular T cell lymphoma </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nodal peripheral T cell lymphoma with T follicular helper (TFH) phenotype </p><p/><p>Such tumors have neoplastic cells that express at least two TFH-related antigens, including <span class=\"nowrap\">CD279/PD1,</span> CD10, BCL6, CXCL13, ICOS, SAP, and CCR5.

In addition to phenotypic similarities to AITL, tumors in these provisional categories also share many of the same somatic mutations, including mutations in the genes <em>TET2, IDH2, DNMT3A, RHOA, </em>and<em> CD28</em>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Hodgkin lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, binucleated or multinucleated cells that resemble the Reed-Sternberg (R-S) cells of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) may be observed in angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma. These cells can even exhibit the immunophenotypic characteristics of true R-S cells, making distinction from HL difficult. However, unlike in HL, there will be a clonal T cell receptor gene rearrangement in most cases of AITL. The prominent vascular proliferation and the proliferation of atypical T cells with clear cytoplasm are absent in HL.

In addition, prognostic models used for other types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma have limited applicability to patients with AITL. Most patients with AITL fall into the high-risk category when assessed with either the International Prognostic Index (IPI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F70850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70850 \">table 2</a>) or the similar Prognostic Index for T cell lymphomas (PIT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/13,23,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,23,38,39</a>]. Studies of gene expression profiling have suggested that overexpression of genes associated with proliferation was associated with shorter survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>In a report from the International Peripheral T cell Lymphoma Project of 243 patients with AITL, estimated rates of overall and failure-free survival at five years were 33 and 18 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The majority of patients fell into high risk categories using the IPI (79 percent) and the PIT (63 percent), respectively. An alternative prognostic index for AITL (PIAI) was proposed that incorporated age, performance status, extranodal involvement, B symptoms, and thrombocytopenia. When applied to a validation cohort, the PIAI separated patients into low and high risk disease with significantly different estimated rates of overall (44 versus 24 months) and failure-free (28 versus 15 percent) survival at five years. </p><p>A retrospective analysis from Japan of 207 patients with AITL with a median follow-up of 42 months reported three-year overall and progression-free survival rates of 54 and 38 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Overall survival at three years according to IPI score was 81, 69, 53, and 35 percent for patients with low-, low-intermediate-, high-intermediate-, and high-risk IPI, respectively.</p><p>Although complete remission can be attained in many patients, relapse is frequent. Infection is the most common cause of death. Treatment with chemotherapy with or without autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation results in long-term survival in up to a third of patients. The treatment of AITL is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-peripheral-t-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of peripheral T cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some patients develop a secondary B cell lymphoma, which is often, but not invariably, Epstein-Barr virus positive, and may be the result of ongoing somatic hypermutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-angioimmunoblastic-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of AITL is best made by excisional tissue biopsy, most commonly a lymph node interpreted in the context of the clinical presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55385\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55385 \">table 1</a>). The histology reveals effaced nodal architecture, prominent arborizing high endothelial venules, and a polymorphous infiltrate including small to large atypical lymphocytes that are positive for CD3 and CD4. Expanded networks of follicular dendritic cells are demonstrated by staining for markers such as CD21.
