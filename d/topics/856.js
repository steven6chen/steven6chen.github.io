However, there has been much less research in these problem areas as compared with disorders of vision and hearing. Patients often do not report the problem and, when they do, frequently get little attention since the complaint is not considered life-threatening or important. Often patients, after having seen many clinicians, are told to live with their problem or that there is no help for them. Yet their smell and taste disorders are significantly disabling. As an example, older adults frequently misidentify warning odors such as smoke or natural gas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The anatomy of taste and olfaction and the etiology of taste and smell disorders are reviewed here. The evaluation of patients with taste and smell complaints and their management is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-taste-and-smell-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of taste and smell disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H687648186\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a survey of American adults, approximately 10 percent reported smell disturbances and 5 percent reported taste disturbances within the prior year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, self-reporting appears to underestimate the true prevalence of taste and smell impairment. Formal testing among adults in the United States revealed that 14 percent had smell impairment, 17 percent had taste impairment, and 2 percent had impairment in both senses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Anosmia (the complete loss of smell) afflicts 3 percent of the population over 40 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of impaired olfaction increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]. In one study, the age-specific prevalence of olfactory dysfunction was 4 percent at 40 to 49 years, 10 percent at 50 to 59 years, 13 percent at 60 to 69 years, 25 percent at 70 to 79 years, and 39 percent over 80 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Anosmia affected 14 to 22 percent of individuals over 60 years old.</p><p>Such disorders have important clinical implications. Among adults 70 years or older, for example, misidentification rates for warning odors were 20 percent for smoke and 31 percent for natural gas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Olfactory dysfunction may also be associated with a higher mortality risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY OF OLFACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The receptors of smell consist of a small area of neuroepithelial cells (the olfactory mucosa) that are located along the superior and middle turbinates and upper part of the nasal septum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The surface of the epithelium has a mucous layer secreted by submucosal Bowman's glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Within its secretions are immunoglobulins A and M, secretory component, lactoferrin, and lysozyme; these help prevent pathogens from gaining intracranial entry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Also present are odorant binding proteins that facilitate the transport of odorants to receptors and are thought to remove odorants from the receptor area once activation has occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Olfactory chemoreceptor cells are primary neurons that project directly to the brain. New olfactory receptors are formed repeatedly during adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The receptor neurons number approximately 6 to 10 million in each nasal cavity and are flask-shaped with a dendritic pole terminating in a dilated knob from which cilia extend into the overlying mucus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The receptors on the cilia bind odorants. The axons of the receptor neurons travel through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone and terminate in the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. These axons constitute the olfactory nerve. Neural pathways subsequently project to the olfactory cortex, orbital frontal cerebral cortex, thalamus, and hypothalamus.</p><p>Mammalian olfactory epithelium maintains the ability to replace olfactory neurons lost via injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Olfactory receptor cells are directly exposed to the external environment and its dangers, including injury from infection, inflammation, and noxious chemical agents. This exposure results in regular turnover of receptor cells via apoptosis, a programmed process in which activation of intrinsic enzymes leads to cell death. Increased levels of Capase3, the dominant enzyme in the apoptotic pathway, have been identified in olfactory epithelial cells in patients with nasal sinus disease and in mouse models of traumatic smell loss, suggesting an increase in apoptosis in these conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY OF TASTE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The taste buds are derived from epithelial cells. They are located in the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue and on the soft palate, uvula, larynx, pharynx, epiglottis, and esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. There are approximately 50 to 150 cells within each taste bud. Taste receptor cells have an average life span of 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Taste receptor cells are innervated by afferent neurons (see below). The initial site of signal transduction is at the taste pore. Protein stimulus interaction induces a change in the cell membrane, opening ion channels and allowing stimulus ions to enter directly through the channels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The lingual taste buds are located on structures called papillae. There are three types of papillae:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fungiform papillae are distributed in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and vary in number from two hundred to several hundred. Approximately 80 percent of fungiform taste buds are located within the first two centimeters of the tip of the tongue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The foliate papillae are located on the posterior lateral sides of the tongue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The circumvallate papillae are located in the rear of the tongue.</p><p/><p>The fungiform papillae may contain as many as 20 taste buds each. The circumvallate and foliate papillae can have hundreds of taste buds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The afferent nerves innervating taste buds are contained in three different nerves. The anterior two-thirds of the tongue are supplied by the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve (VII). The palate is innervated by another branch of the facial nerve, the superficial petrosal nerve. The posterior tongue is innervated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX). The pharynx and larynx are innervated by the vagus nerve (X).</p><p>The primary taste afferent nerves synapse in the nucleus of the solitary tract in the medulla. Taste information is then transmitted to the thalamus and primary gustatory cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Ageusia (absent taste function) is uncommon due to the interaction between the cranial nerves VII, IX, and X.</p><p>Branches of the trigeminal nerve innervate the interior of the mouth and nasal cavity; they account for the burning and irritating sensation afforded by hot pepper and the fumes of ammonia. Innervation of the respiratory and sinus areas of the nasal cavity is by two branches of the trigeminal nerve: the ethmoid and nasopalatine nerves. In the oral cavity, the lingual nerve innervates the tongue and floor of the mouth, the nasopalatine nerve innervates the hard palate, the posterior palatine innervates the soft palate, and the buccal nerve innervates the cheek mucosa. Seventy-five percent of the innervation of the fungiform papillae on the tongue is carried out by trigeminal fibers; the remainder is accounted for by the chorda tympani nerve. The glossopharyngeal nerve carries out the sensory function of the trigeminal nerve in the posterior portion of the mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The epiglottis and uvula are innervated by the vagus nerve.</p><p>Four taste qualities have generally been described: sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. More recently, a fifth taste &quot;umami,&quot; the taste of glutamate, has been added [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It is an unusual taste, and because the taste system is complex it has generally been more practical to deal with only the original four taste qualities. However, in the future it is possible that taste testing may include umami.</p><p>The tastants travel through salivary secretion and mucus surrounding taste buds to interact with taste cells. Saliva plays an essential role in transporting the tastants to the buds. Taste stimuli that are water soluble are carried readily to the receptors. Others need soluble carrier proteins to arrive at the receptor.</p><p>Changes in taste occur when the inorganic ingredients of saliva are altered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], when there are changes in the structure of taste pore mucus or the taste cell environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], and when there are changes in receptor proteins, transport proteins, and cation channels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, as an example, decreased salivary function is common; the lack of saliva greatly impedes the sensation of taste.

Olfactory neurons have regenerative capabilities and olfactory function may return [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, only 10 percent of 99 patients with olfactory loss due to head trauma showed improvement over one year in a series from a university outpatient smell and taste clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. One small study (n = 25) found a correlation between the degree of retronasal parosmia, loss of volume of the olfactory bulb, and presence of frontal and temporal cerebral damage on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195357314\"><span class=\"h3\">Post-viral olfactory dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral upper respiratory infections can damage peripheral olfactory receptors and probably central olfactory pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

With aging, there is a loss of olfactory epithelium surface area and a decrease in the density of adrenergic innervation within the lamina propria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The calcium-binding protein-D 28K-immunoreactive elements are also decreased in the older olfactory epithelium. Additionally, the olfactory bulb undergoes significant degenerative changes in older adults that result in losses in the number of cell bodies and neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. While it has been estimated that the adult olfactory bulb contains approximately 60,000 mitral cells at age 25, there are often only 14,500 at the age of 95 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Specific neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and dementia with Lewy bodies are associated with changes in olfaction.

The taste system either accepts or rejects food or drink. An intact taste system can protect the body against poisonous or injurious material. The taste system also is an important feature in salivation and swallowing, contributes to reflexes of ingestion and egestion, and is associated with conscious taste sensations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. It has a primary role in sensory recognition as a gatekeeper to the intake of food and drink.</p><p>The term flavor involves the combined features of smell, taste, irritation, texture, and temperature. The smell or aroma of food and beverages is the most important contributor to flavor; derangement of the smell system is often described by patients as a problem with taste [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Olfactory disorders are reported more frequently than taste impairment since patients recognize smell loss more readily due to the dramatic decrease in the ability to perceive the flavor of food and beverages.</p><p>Total loss of taste is rarely seen because of the anatomy and redundancy of the taste system. Complaints of taste distortion or phantom tastes (dysgeusia) are much more common. Losses in taste perception do occur with aging, although they are not as marked as losses in olfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Detection and recognition thresholds are higher in older individuals, and sensitivity to sweet, sour, salty, and bitter qualities is reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Some investigators believe that loss of taste buds is of primary importance in the pathogenesis of taste impairment with aging, while others have concluded that changes in taste cell membranes are the important factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Complications due to the loss of taste can occur if sugar and salt are consumed in greater amounts (eg, in patients with diabetes, congestive heart failure, or renal insufficiency) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>In addition to the effects of aging, the taste buds are subject to direct attack from viral infections, chemicals, and drugs due to their superficial location. A large number of medical disorders also can be associated with gustatory dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68168\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68168 \">table 2</a>). In one study of 196 cases of taste complaints, the most common complaint was hypogeusia (54 percent); upper respiratory infection was a prominent cause (15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

A dry mouth (xerostomia) makes proper chewing of food difficult and can give rise to mucosal infections. Reduction in saliva output may cause injury to taste buds and their activity. Closure of taste pores, which provide access to taste buds, can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Bacterial and fungal infections in the mouth can cause significant disturbances and affect taste via reduced blood flow to the tongue.

Chemicals, drugs, and exposure to certain metals (mercury, copper, zinc, chromium, lead, etc) may lead to taste alterations. Solvents often cause injury to chemosensory receptors. A sweet metallic taste has been described with lead poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anatomy-and-etiology-of-taste-and-smell-disorders/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

Thus, complete taste loss in head trauma is rarely seen unless severe central neurologic damage has occurred. Only 0.5 percent of patients with head injuries complain of taste loss; dysgeusia is a much more frequent problem.</p><p>Peripheral nerve injury may cause localized taste impairment.
