The disease typically begins with constitutional symptoms such as fever, anorexia, and malaise. Initially diarrhea is watery, but subsequently may contain blood and mucus. Tenesmus is a common complaint.</p><p>Stool frequency is typically 8 to 10 per day, but may increase to up to 100 per day. Significant fluid loss is uncommon (average approximately 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day); this is in contrast to small bowel infections, which are typified by large volumes of watery diarrhea associated with abdominal cramping, bloating, gas and weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

In a normal host, the course of disease is generally self-limited, lasting no more than seven days when left untreated.</p><p>The typical course of disease varies with age group. In a review of 318 infants and children hospitalized with shigellosis in Bangladesh, infants had fewer days with diarrhea (four versus six) and were more likely to have watery (as opposed to bloody) stools, hyponatremia, abdominal distension, and acidosis than older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Older children were more likely to have a leukemoid reaction than infants. The mortality rate for infants was twice that of older children. In another study conducted at the same institution, infants who were breast fed were less frequently infected and had a milder illness than infants who were not breast fed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Intestinal complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several intestinal complications can occur in the setting of <em>Shigella</em> infection; each is relatively rare (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69134\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69134 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Proctitis or rectal prolapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In infants and young children, the severe inflammation of the rectum and distal colon that is induced by invasion of the organism into the colonic mucosa may lead to proctitis or rectal prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Toxic megacolon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toxic megacolon occurs primarily in the setting of <em>S. dysenteriae</em> 1 infection. The pathogenesis of this complication is unclear; it occurs in the setting of pancolitis and seems to be related to the intensity of inflammation rather than being mediated by Shiga toxin. The incidence of toxic megacolon among patients admitted to the diarrhea treatment center in Bangladesh was 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Intestinal obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe colonic disease may result in intestinal obstruction.

The patients with obstruction were more likely to be infected with <em>S. dysenteriae</em> 1 and were more severely ill, as evidenced by a significantly higher white blood cell count and lower serum sodium concentration than patients without evidence of obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Colonic perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colonic perforation is an extremely rare complication of shigellosis. It occurs principally in infants or severely malnourished patients and is associated with infection due to <em>S. dysenteriae</em> 1 or <em>S. flexneri</em>. In one epidemic of <em>S. dysenteriae</em> 1 in Central America, colonic perforation was seen at autopsy in 1.7 percent of fatal cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shigellosis may be associated with a number of systemic complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69134\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69134 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Bacteremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of bacteremia has been reported to be 0 to 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Signs that correlate with bacteremia are leukocytosis, hypothermia, temperature above 39.5&ordm;C, severe dehydration, and lethargy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Bacteremia is more common among children than adults, occurring primarily among children younger than five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17,18</a>]. Among the 22 cases of bacteremia described among adults in the literature, one-third of patients were older than 65 years of age, and more than half had an underlying disease (most commonly diabetes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>HIV infection does not appear to confer significant predisposition to <em>Shigella</em> bacteremia. Among adults in Soweto, South Africa, the rate of HIV infection nearly doubled between 1996 and 2006 although the rate of <em>Shigella</em> bacteremia remained stable (approximately 0.2 per 1000 adults; 0.8 per 100 children) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Bacteremia is associated with an increased risk of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Young, malnourished children are at greatest risk. Additionally, the mortality rate associated with <em>Shigella</em> bacteremia may be higher in the setting of HIV infection. In a study of systemic Shigellosis in South Africa, HIV-infected patients were substantially more likely to die than HIV-uninfected individuals (29 of 78 versus 5 of 40 fatal cases, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. We recommend antibiotic treatment for all patients who become bacteremic with <em>Shigella</em>.

In a review of 412 patients with shigellosis, 36 percent had mild dehydration, 12 percent had moderate dehydration, and 2 percent had severe dehydration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In another series, hyponatremia (defined as serum sodium below 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L)</span> was noted in 29 percent of patients hospitalized with diarrhea due to <em>S. dysenteriae</em> 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Hyponatremia is generally due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, not volume depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21</a>].</p><p>Protein-losing enteropathy also may be observed. In one report that used the level of alpha-1 antitrypsin in stool as an indicator of protein excretion, protein loss was high during the acute phase in patients who had dysentery, remained high in patients who failed therapy, and fell to normal low values in those who were cured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Increased catabolism secondary to fever, stool protein loss, decreased intake due to anorexia and malabsorption can exacerbate pre-existing malnutrition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Leukemoid reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A leukemoid reaction (defined as a white blood count of <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/mm<sup>3</sup></span> or more) has been observed in Bangladesh among approximately 4 percent of patients, most commonly in children between 2 and 10 years of age (and not at all in children younger than one year of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The white blood cell count in these patients ranged from 50,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">195,000/mm<sup>3</sup></span> and was accompanied by an increased number of immature forms. In this study, the mortality rate also was increased among patients with a leukemoid reaction (21 versus 7 percent). In contrast, a study conducted in the United States found no association between disease severity and a high white blood cell count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Neurologic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seizures are the most common neurologic complication associated with <em>Shigella</em> infection. They tend to be generalized and are not associated with specific neurologic deficits but have been associated with a higher risk of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Seizures occur almost exclusively among children &lt;15 years. The occurrence of seizures is associated with fever (often greater than 39&ordm;C), increased proportion of immature leukocytes, low serum sodium, and high serum potassium. Seizures have been observed during infection with all serotypes of <em>Shigella</em>.</p><p>The reported prevalence of seizures among children with shigellosis has ranged from 5 to 45 percent; among patients of all ages hospitalized with shigellosis the prevalence is about 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,24,25</a>]. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid obtained by lumbar puncture is typically normal, although up to 15 percent may have mild lymphocytic pleocytosis with up to 12 cells.</p><p>Neurologic complications of <em>Shigella</em> infection were previously thought to be induced by circulating Shiga toxin produced by <em>S. dysenteriae</em> 1, though this is not likely to be correct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In a study of five children performed to determine whether seizures were associated with Shiga toxin, clinical specimens including stool, serum, and cell-free cerebrospinal fluid were examined in vitro for cytotoxic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Cytotoxic activity was not detected in serum or spinal fluid, although it was present in stool, at levels 1000-fold below that of cultured <em>S. dysenteriae</em> 1. The stool cytotoxic activity was not neutralized by anti-Shiga toxin antibodies, no patient had neutralizing antibodies to Shiga toxin, and DNA hybridization studies of the <em>Shigella</em> isolates that probed for the gene encoding Shiga toxin were negative.</p><p>Thus, although this study is too small to be conclusive, it did not demonstrate a relationship between Shiga toxin and seizures. Furthermore, the majority of patients who have seizures are infected with <em>S. flexneri </em>or <em>S. sonnei</em>, which do not express Shiga toxin. Taken together, these data suggest that other <em>Shigella</em> enterotoxins might contribute to the induction of seizures, although this possibility requires further study. The enterotoxin ShET1 has been identified in strains of <em>S. flexneri</em> 2a [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], and the enterotoxin ShET2 has been identified in members of all four serogroups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], but the role of these or other as yet unidentified enterotoxins in <em>Shigella</em>-induced seizures is unknown.</p><p>In addition to seizures, other neurologic findings have been described in up to 40 percent of children hospitalized with <em>Shigella</em> infection, including encephalopathy with lethargy, confusion, and headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Obtundation, coma, and posturing are rare. In cases of fatal encephalopathy, cerebral edema has been observed at autopsy.</p><p>A particularly lethal form of shigellosis, known as the Ekiri syndrome, was responsible for 15,000 deaths per year in Japan during the pre-World War II era [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The Ekiri syndrome was associated with <em>S. sonnei</em> infection and was characterized by the rapid development of seizures and coma in patients with high fever and few dysenteric symptoms.

In a study of US military personnel, reactive arthritis occurred in 0.5 percent of cases of <em>Shigella</em> gastroenteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The arthritis is a sterile inflammatory arthritis. Symptoms develop one to two weeks following symptoms of dysentery, regardless of whether or not the dysentery was treated with antibiotics. Approximately 70 percent of patients with arthritis are HLA-B27 positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. A 5 amino acid peptide encoded on a 2 Md <em>Shigella</em> plasmid has been associated with reactive arthritis in two separate studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. This peptide has sequence similarity to the HLA B27 alpha 1 domain, suggesting that molecular mimicry may play a pathogenetic role in arthritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-spondyloarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of spondyloarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is one case report in which bacterial lipopolysaccharide antigen was detected in the synovial fluid of a patient with post-<em>Shigella</em> reactive arthritis; the significance of this finding is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>Sterile reactive arthritis has also been described following infection with <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em>, <em>Salmonella enteritidis</em>, <em>Shigella typhimurium</em>, <em>Yersinia enterocolitica</em>, and <em>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemolytic-uremic syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although relatively uncommon, the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is the most frequent cause of acute renal failure among infants and young children worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Ninety percent of cases of HUS in children follow a diarrheal prodrome; it is most often due to infection with enterohemorrhagic <em>Escherichia coli</em> (particularly type O157:H7), but may also be induced by infection with <em>S. dysenteriae</em> 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The other 10 percent of cases have a variety of etiologies, including drugs, malignancy, pregnancy, and collagen vascular disease. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is a related disorder with overlapping clinical findings that occurs more commonly in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

These systems typically have the capability to identify any of multiple enteric bacterial pathogens from a homogenized stool sample in a few hours. However, they are not able to assess antimicrobial susceptibility of identified pathogens. If <em>Shigella</em> is identified on molecular testing of stool, a sample should also be submitted for culture and susceptibility testing.

In particular, susceptibility testing for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> should assess drug dilutions of 0.12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> or lower, and clinicians should request the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to ciprofloxacin if it is not provided with the susceptibility testing results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In the United States, an increasing proportion of isolates have an MIC to ciprofloxacin of 0.12 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>.
