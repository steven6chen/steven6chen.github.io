Estimated death rates among infants and children younger than 14 years of age range from 0.2 to 1 death per million population, although the diagnosis may be missed in a significant number of pediatric deaths. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> below.)</p><p>Although generally harmful, severe hypothermia may rarely provide cerebral protection against anoxia, allowing cases of remarkable survival even after prolonged arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Physics of heat loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heat is lost from the body by radiation, conduction, convection, evaporation, and respiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Of these, radiation can account for up to 50 percent of heat loss, even in indoor settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Convection may account for 25 percent of heat loss even in still air, and wind markedly increases convective losses. Wet clothing increases evaporation; in severe conditions, this heat loss may be six times basal metabolic heat production. Conduction, although low in air, is approximately 25 times more rapid in water. Finally, cooling during rescue and resuscitation will be hastened by continued exposure, respiratory heat loss, and the infusion of large quantities of unheated room temperature fluids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pediatric considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children, especially young children and infants, are at more risk of hypothermia than adults, for several reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The younger the child, the larger the ratio of surface area to body mass.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children may have decreased ability to recognize, avoid, or escape hypothermic exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Young children have limited glycogen stores to support heat production.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Young infants do not have the ability to increase heat production through shivering.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with predisposing conditions (eg multisystem trauma, burns, congenital nervous system anomalies, anorexia nervosa, or drug overdose) are at particular risk. (See <a href=\"#H9285874\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History may be misleading. Pediatric hypothermia does not require extreme exposure. Furthermore, child punishment and maltreatment with cold water is not rare but is almost always omitted from caregiver histories.</p><p/><p>Although more at risk than adults to get cold, once children are severely hypothermic, they may be more likely to have good neurologic outcomes. This is because the neuroprotective effect appears to depend on a combination of rapid cooling and preserved circulation, both typical of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic changes with stages of hypothermia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The stages of hypothermia correspond to the body's changing physiologic responses to cold (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70617\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70617 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,3,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mild</strong> &ndash; In mild hypothermia, the body attempts to combat heat loss by shivering, vasoconstriction, and increased metabolism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Moderate</strong> &ndash; Moderate hypothermia spans a narrow range in which compensatory mechanisms begin to fail. Changes may include absence of shivering, respiratory depression, decreased heat production, circulatory insufficiency and instability, vasodilation, hypovolemia, and impaired consciousness, including lethargy, confusion, and possible &quot;paradoxical undressing&quot; or other irrational behavior.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe</strong> &ndash; In severe hypothermia, cold slows or stops the metabolic machinery underlying body function. The metabolism slows by approximately 6 percent for each 1&deg;C (1.8&deg;F) decrease in body temperature, such that at 28&deg;C (82&deg;F) the basal metabolic rate is approximately half of normal. At this temperature, all body systems begin to fail including circulation, ventilation, and the central nervous system. Patients often lose consciousness; vital signs may be absent. Muscle rigidity without shivering can be mistaken for rigor mortis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The absence of shivering and presence of stupor, skin flushing, muscle rigidity, hypoventilation, and circulatory failure means very cold patients often appear dead rather than hypothermic. This may partly explain why many severely cold patients are pronounced dead without consideration of hypothermia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, in this stage of severe hypothermia (core temperature &lt;28&deg;C or 82&deg;F), a suspended metabolism may protect against hypoxia. Patients have survived anoxia for 12 to 18 minutes at 28&deg;C (82&deg;F) and up to 60 minutes or more at 20&deg;C (68&deg;F) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Intact recovery has been reported after submersion for up to 66 minutes, after hours of arrest without cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), after CPR for as long as six and a half hours, and with total resuscitation times up to nine hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,13,15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13,15,17</a>].

Only with such recognition can the patient benefit from rapid, effective rewarming and vigorous support.

Even in the presence of potential survivability, these changes make recognition of hypothermia more difficult and its reversal more challenging:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Respiratory depression</strong> &ndash; Respiration progressively becomes slow, shallow, irregular, and then absent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypovolemia</strong> &ndash; Blood volume markedly decreases because of extravasation due to vascular leak and a profound &quot;cold diuresis&quot; caused by erroneous internal sensing of blood volume as well as failure of renal concentrating function. The hydrostatic effects of immersion further promote hypovolemia in water rescue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Circulatory collapse</strong> &ndash; Cardiac output is reduced by hypovolemia, sludging of blood due to cold, decreased myocardial contractility, and bradycardia. In addition, the loss of vasomotor regulation drops systemic vascular resistance. These combined effects lead to circulatory collapse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Arrhythmias</strong> &ndash; Hypothermia increases myocardial irritability. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a frequent problem in severe hypothermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Potential triggers of VF include rough patient handling, patient exertion, core temperature afterdrop (further cooling of the body after being removed from cold exposure), administration of room-temperature fluids, and direct stimulation of the myocardium (eg, subclavian central lines), and rewarming shock.

This observation is especially true for mental status changes and cardiac arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"#H1685770\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Further cooling or rough handling may promote shock or ventricular fibrillation in the cold patient; both should be prevented during assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Because the diagnosis is frequently overlooked, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for hypothermia. The clinical features become less obvious as patients become more severely hypothermic. Skin that looks or feels cold may be seen during ordinary winter weather, with vasovagal changes in circulation (eg, with nausea), and even with chills in a child who is actually febrile. By contrast, in severe hypothermia, flushing and edema without shivering or goose bumps often create a misleading impression that the skin is not cold.</p><p>The clinical features of hypothermia by stage, although somewhat variable, are typically as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mild hypothermia</strong> &ndash; Between approximately 32 and 35&deg;C (90 to 95&deg;F), the child may display shivering, piloerection (&quot;goose bumps&quot;), and peripheral vasoconstriction with prolonged capillary refill time, pallor, and acrocyanosis. These changes arise from physiologic mechanisms designed to preserve core body temperature. Of note, young infants try to preserve heat by intense peripheral vasoconstriction; they have limited ability to shiver, and are less able to maintain body heat than older children. Many cold infants display &quot;paradoxical rosy cheeks&quot;, and appear healthy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Moderate hypothermia</strong> &ndash; Mental function may begin to decrease between 28 and 32&deg;C (82 to 90&deg;F). Slurred speech, clumsy movements, and impaired thinking may produce a picture of intoxication, thus hindering recognition of hypothermia. In general, agitation and distress give way to confusion and lethargy as core body temperature continues to drop. As hypothermia progresses, shivering stops, and heart rate, ventilation, and blood pressure become variable and then depressed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe hypothermia</strong> &ndash; Below approximately 28&deg;C (82&deg;F) the appearance of hypothermia becomes less obvious, as shivering and pallor give way to muscle rigidity and flushed skin. Patients with such muscle rigidity may be described as &quot;frozen stiff&quot;, but freezing doesn't occur above a core body temperature of 0&deg;C (32&deg;F). Rather, this rigidity reflects dysfunction of actin-myosin bundles within skeletal muscle. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In severe hypothermia, bradycardia and hypotension progress to pulselessness, ventricular fibrillation, or asystole. Although ventricular fibrillation or asystole are typical endpoint rhythms in hypothermia, a number of other rhythms may occur including sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular blockade, atrial fibrillation, and junctional rhythm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Stupor gives way to unresponsive coma with fixed and dilated pupils.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">With all these changes, the severely or profoundly hypothermic patient may appear dead.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1687020\"><span class=\"h1\">ANCILLARY STUDIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of hypothermia on laboratory evaluation is discussed in more detail separately.

When core temperature assessment is not readily available, assessment of shivering, level of consciousness, and vital signs provide a means of estimating the initial stage of hypothermia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62978\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62978 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>].</p><p>Otherwise, the accurate measurement of core body temperature in children with hypothermia is essential to proper diagnosis; temperatures should be taken with a low-reading thermometer. The clinician should not use standard clinical thermometers in hypothermic patients because they do not read below 34&deg;C (93&deg;F). In addition, the oral, axillary, and cutaneous sites are unreliable. Indirect tympanic temperatures have been found to be inaccurate in cold water exposure, and should not guide decisions about life and death in profound hypothermia, but are supported by some experts for use in cases of mild, moderate, and even severe hypothermia when no other measures are available.

These and other pediatric etiologies of hypothermia can be organized by pathophysiology as shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F88088\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88088 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>The hypothermia in patients with medical conditions as a primary cause is typically mild on presentation (core body temperature 32 to 35&deg;C [90 to 95&deg;F]) and occurs without environmental exposure. However, patients with these medical conditions are predisposed to more severe degrees of hypothermia with exposure.</p><p>Certain aspects of hypothermia warrant emphasis by etiology:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Environmental exposure</strong> &ndash; Hypothermia occurs even in warm climates, such as the southern United States, where cold-related deaths may be twice as common as those due to heat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A child may develop hypothermia when exposed to wet or windy conditions even when ambient temperature is moderate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trauma and resuscitation</strong> &ndash; Beyond exposure, common causes of hypothermia include injury, transport, and resuscitation, even in warm climates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], and especially in infants and young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypothermia-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Hypothermia is common in settings where environmental exposure is prolonged (eg, water rescue; motor vehicle collision with prolonged extrication). Patients with brain or spinal cord injuries are at greater risk for hypothermia if thermoregulatory systems are damaged. Multisystem trauma patients warrant early measurement of core temperature during resuscitation and efforts to prevent heat loss.

These patients may be ill appearing and have clinical findings (eg, lethargy, hypotension, widened pulse pressure) that cannot be attributed to mild hypothermia. Such patients warrant appropriate cultures (urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid), fluid resuscitation, and intravenous antibiotics targeted to the most likely infectious etiology based upon age and epidemiologic considerations.

Post-mortem cooling develops slowly. An unexpected degree of hypothermia after a supposedly recent incident may signal child abuse. Other signs of physical abuse or neglect may help identify this situation.
