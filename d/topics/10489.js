The outcomes of pregnancies in women with pericardial disease are similar to those expected in the general population with pericardial disease. More difficult cases may require a multidisciplinary approach involving different subspecialties (eg, cardiology, internal medicine, maternal-fetal medicine, and neonatology).</p><p>Relatively few data are available to guide the management of pericardial disease during pregnancy. However, as with pregnancy in general, the major tenet of avoiding all medications and interventions that are not absolutely necessary should be followed.</p><p>This topic will discuss the clinical features, diagnosis, and management of pericardial effusion and acute (or recurrent) pericarditis during pregnancy.

In general, if the patient remains asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable and the effusion is not increasing in size, we continue with serial echocardiograms every three months until the pericardial effusion is decreasing in size or resolved. For pregnant women with a small asymptomatic pericardial effusion, we repeat the echocardiogram only if clinically indicated by signs or symptoms suggestive of possible pericardial tamponade, as small pericardial effusions are usually benign and spontaneously resolve. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE PERICARDITIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2430687457\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology and etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no published data on the frequency of acute pericarditis in pregnancy.

Infectious etiologies other than viral are less common than in the general population. Tuberculous pericarditis should be suspected especially in cases coming from endemic areas or in case of HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pericardial-effusion-and-acute-pericarditis-during-pregnancy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

Patients with an infectious etiology may present with signs and symptoms of systemic infection such as fever and leukocytosis. Viral etiologies in particular may be preceded by &quot;flu-like&quot; respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients with a known autoimmune disorder or malignancy may present with signs or symptoms specific to their underlying disorder.

Pericarditis should also be suspected in a patient with persistent fever and pericardial effusion or new unexplained cardiomegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pericardial-effusion-and-acute-pericarditis-during-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Additional testing, which typically includes blood work, chest radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography, can support the diagnosis but is frequently normal or unrevealing. The electrocardiogram is usually the first and one of the most helpful diagnostic tests in patients with chest pain and suspected acute pericarditis. Because ST segment elevations in a patient with chest pain may also be seen in patients with an acute coronary syndrome, careful evaluation of all ECG findings is critical. Echocardiography is often normal, but it is an essential part of the evaluation if there is evidence of an associated pericardial effusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs of cardiac tamponade. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of acute pericarditis in pregnancy is made using the same criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74376\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74376 \">table 2</a>) as in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pericardial-effusion-and-acute-pericarditis-during-pregnancy/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>]. Echocardiography is the imaging method of choice for diagnosis, evaluating the hemodynamic impact of pericardial fluid, absence of regional wall motion (when STEMI is considered), guidance for pericardiocentesis when needed, and follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pericardial-effusion-and-acute-pericarditis-during-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Diagnostic x-rays of the chest, if indicated, produce almost no scatter to the fetus; any radiation received would not result in a measurably increased risk, especially if the maternal abdomen is shielded. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium and nuclear isotope scans with gallium-67 are generally avoided unless necessary to significantly improve diagnostic performance and improve fetal or maternal outcome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3049705511\"><span class=\"h2\">Determination of risk and need for hospitalization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many clinicians admit all new cases of acute pericarditis to the hospital, but this may not be necessary. A pregnant patient with uncomplicated acute pericarditis can undergo initial evaluation in a same-day hospital facility or clinic, although outpatient follow-up is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pericardial-effusion-and-acute-pericarditis-during-pregnancy/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. On the other hand, pregnant patients with high-risk features are at increased risk of short-term complications and have a higher likelihood of a specific disease, as is also the case in non-pregnant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pericardial-effusion-and-acute-pericarditis-during-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

In addition to activity restriction, the therapy of acute pericarditis should be targeted as much as possible to the underlying etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pericardial-effusion-and-acute-pericarditis-during-pregnancy/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>]. In patients with an identified cause other than viral infection, specific therapy appropriate to the underlying disorder is indicated. However, in developed countries, most cases of acute pericarditis in immunocompetent patients are idiopathic and considered to be most likely due to a viral infection. Because of the relatively benign course associated with the common causes of pericarditis (&gt;80 percent of cases), it is at not necessary to search for the etiology in all patients. As such, most patients are treated for a presumptive viral cause with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, potential fetal problems with use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> and other COX inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulindac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulindac</a>, nimesulide) are constriction of the ductus arteriosus and oligohydramnios. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pericardial disease associated with malignancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculous-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculous pericarditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=purulent-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Purulent pericarditis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Most patients with acute pericarditis can be managed effectively with medical therapy alone. However, patients with a large pericardial effusion, a hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion, a suspicion of a bacterial or neoplastic etiology, or evidence of constrictive pericarditis should be evaluated for invasive therapies, such as pericardial drainage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pericardiotomy (pericardial window).

Patients with a specific cause identified should have treatment tailored to that specific etiology, while patients with idiopathic pericarditis should receive anti-inflammatory therapy, with the exception that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> is not used in pregnant patients.

In this population, glucocorticoids are the preferred therapy as they have not been associated with birth defects after the first trimester, and neonatal adrenal suppression is rare. Dosing is similar to that recommended in recurrent pericarditis. Inducing maternal gestational diabetes is a potential concern. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recurrent-pericarditis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recurrent pericarditis&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoids'</a>.)</p><p/><p>As is true for the use of all drugs during pregnancy, treatment of acute pericarditis must balance the benefits of therapy against the potential harm to the fetus. A list of common anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs used in the treatment of pericardial diseases is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52475\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52475 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F63892\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63892 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>The largest report of pregnant women with pericarditis includes six cases (mean age 30 years, mean gestational age at delivery 38 weeks, and mean birth weight 2839 g), all with an idiopathic etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pericardial-effusion-and-acute-pericarditis-during-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Four women were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> 800 mg three times daily with gradual tapering in three within 20 weeks of gestation. In one case, aspirin was continued until delivery. All women were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at a low to moderate dose (eg, 10 to 25 mg daily), in four cases during all the pregnancy and in two cases starting at the third trimester. Five pregnancies (83 percent) were uneventful; HELLP syndrome developed in the mother who was treated with aspirin until delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hellp-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HELLP syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h4\">NSAID therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not teratogenic and can be safely used during the first and second trimester. After gestational week 20, all NSAIDs (except <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> at less than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> can cause constriction of the ductus arteriosus and impair fetal renal function and the rates seem to increase dramatically after week 28. Thus aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), excluding COX-2 inhibitors, can be continued until the second trimester but should be withdrawn beginning at 20 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pericardial-effusion-and-acute-pericarditis-during-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Because there are no data on selective COX-2 inhibitors, these medications should be avoided during pregnancy.</p><p>For pregnant women who are less than 20 weeks pregnant, we recommend NSAIDs rather than glucocorticoids as the initial treatment. The 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (500 to 750 mg every eight hours) as the first choice of therapy, although other NSAIDs are allowed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pericardial-effusion-and-acute-pericarditis-during-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. There is no evidence that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> is inferior to aspirin, and therefore it may also be used as first-line therapy. The initial administration of an NSAID should be at a full dose (ie, &quot;attack dose&quot;) every six to eight hours to achieve better symptom control than with a lower dose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56484\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56484 \">table 5</a>). The attack dose is maintained empirically for one to two weeks or until complete symptom resolution. Tapering should be considered following the attack dose in an attempt to reduce the subsequent risk of recurrence.

In our experience, rapid tapering of systemic glucocorticoids increases the risk of treatment failure and recurrence. Although high doses of glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span> have been recommended in the ESC guidelines, use of lower doses (eg, prednisone 0.25 to 0.50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day)</span> may be equally efficacious. Generally, we do not start with total daily doses higher than 25 mg in pregnant women. These relatively lower doses may be useful in reducing the risk of steroid side effects, which have been reported in up to 25 percent of patients treated with high doses.

In general, these effusions are asymptomatic, benign, transient, and resolve spontaneously without therapy. In the absence of signs or symptoms of acute pericarditis or cardiac tamponade, neither diagnostic testing (eg, follow-up echocardiography) nor specific treatment is required. (See <a href=\"#H3878252106\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pregnant women who are identified with a moderate or large pericardial effusion that is not felt to require immediate drainage, serial follow-up testing with echocardiography should be performed every three months until resolved. For pregnant women with a small asymptomatic pericardial effusion, we repeat the echocardiogram only if clinically indicated by signs or symptoms suggestive of possible pericardial tamponade.

Pericarditis should also be suspected in a patient with persistent fever and pericardial effusion or new unexplained cardiomegaly. The diagnosis of acute pericarditis in pregnancy is made using the same criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74376\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74376 \">table 2</a>) as in the general population.
