Most patients have some difficulty adapting to nocturnal use of NPPV, although occasional patients adapt within days. Facilitating adjustment to NPPV is important as regular use of NPPV has been shown to lengthen survival in patients with neuromuscular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troubleshooting-problems-with-noninvasive-positive-pressure-ventilation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, greater than four hours of use per night has been associated with increased CO<sub>2</sub> responsiveness and lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) levels when compared to less than four hours per night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troubleshooting-problems-with-noninvasive-positive-pressure-ventilation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Approaches to resolving the most common side effects of NPPV and to addressing failure of NPPV to improve gas exchange are reviewed here. The indications for and the initiation of nocturnal and daytime NPPV are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Practical aspects of nocturnal noninvasive ventilation in neuromuscular and chest wall disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous noninvasive ventilatory support for patients with respiratory muscle dysfunction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Types of noninvasive nocturnal ventilatory support in neuromuscular and chest wall disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MASK INTOLERANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mask discomfort is the most commonly encountered problem for patients adapting to noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troubleshooting-problems-with-noninvasive-positive-pressure-ventilation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The practitioner should ensure that mask fit is optimal and that minimal strap tension is used to control air leaking. Trials with different types of interfaces may help, such as the &quot;bubble&quot; mask, gel masks, nasal &quot;pillows,&quot; custom-fit masks, or even oronasal masks or mouthpieces. The patient should not be forced to use the mask for more time than can be tolerated, and should be encouraged to attempt adaptation for at least several weeks or months before giving up. Adaptation can include wearing the mask for brief, but progressively longer, periods while watching TV or participating in another distracting activity. Despite these efforts, a minority of patients may be unable to tolerate the sensation of a foreign body strapped to the face, and alternative noninvasive ventilators should be tried. The helmet interface should not be used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Types of noninvasive nocturnal ventilatory support in neuromuscular and chest wall disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">NASAL CONGESTION OR DRYNESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both nasal congestion and dryness occur commonly during noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), sometimes in the same patient. These complaints tend to be seasonal (dryness worse during the winter months) and should be treated symptomatically.</p><p>In-line heated humidification has become standard and has reduced the nasal dryness problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troubleshooting-problems-with-noninvasive-positive-pressure-ventilation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Both the warmth and increased humidity tend to enhance comfort with the airflow. The heated humidifier may also decrease nasal resistance to airflow, which is helpful for patients with concomitant obstructive sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troubleshooting-problems-with-noninvasive-positive-pressure-ventilation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The heater may be adjusted to increase and decrease the humidity of the incoming air as needed depending on the local environmental conditions, the pressures at which the ventilator is set, and patient preference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troubleshooting-problems-with-noninvasive-positive-pressure-ventilation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Pass-over humidifiers (in which the gas passes over the surface of water) are most often used with pressure-limited ventilators, in order to avoid the drop in pressure that could occur with pass-through humidifiers (in which the gas is bubbled through water). Insulation around the tubing or heated wires within (heated tubing) may also help decrease condensation inside the tube, known as &quot;rain-out.&quot; Condensation in the tube seems to be particularly problematic in cold climates where the indoor temperatures are often lower at night.</p><p>Dryness may also respond to nasal saline and water based nasal gels. These thicker gels can be applied in a thin layer along the inside of the nose and can help with mucosal discomfort. These gels are also helpful to decrease local irritation, when using the nasal pillow interface.</p><p>Nasal congestion may be ameliorated by use of inhaled nasal glucocorticoids or antihistamine decongestant combinations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109755207\"><span class=\"h1\">SECRETION CLEARANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secretion clearance and cough assistance for patients on noninvasive ventilation, particularly those with neuromuscular disease, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous noninvasive ventilatory support for patients with respiratory muscle dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Cough assistance'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">NASAL BRIDGE REDNESS OR ULCERATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nasal bridge redness or ulceration is caused by excessive mask tension on the nasal bridge. This usually results from efforts to reduce air leaking around the mask, which may irritate the eyes. Minimizing strap tension usually alleviates the problem and can be achieved by using foam rubber &quot;spacers,&quot; applying artificial skin (eg, Duoderm, Restore), or switching to alternative masks such as the &quot;bubble&quot; mask or nasal &quot;pillows.&quot; Alternating between mask and nasal pillows may also allow irritation at one site (eg, bridge of nose or facial skin) to resolve while another contact site (eg, inside the nostril) is used. However, the patient needs to be comfortable with both interfaces for this to be effective.</p><p>Some patients develop acneiform skin rashes where the mask contacts the skin. Low potency corticosteroid creams, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> lotion may be helpful. Washing the face with a mild soap prior to application of the mask may help as well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">GASTRIC INSUFFLATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients notice abdominal distention and flatulence in association with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) use. These symptoms are usually tolerable and transient, and do not warrant changes in settings. Intolerable distention is infrequent, probably because pressures used during NPPV rarely exceed 25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. However, a reduction in inflation pressure or addition of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simethicone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simethicone</a> may help if intolerable symptoms occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">AIR LEAKING THROUGH THE MOUTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leakage of air through the mouth is universal among users of nasal noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). Patients can often be satisfactorily ventilated despite such leakage, and no special measures need be taken. Pressure-limited ventilators are able to compensate for leaks by sustaining airflow to maintain mask pressure. Leak compensation during volume-limited ventilation requires an upward adjustment in tidal volume. This may result in some narrowing of the glottis, so that the proportion of air entering the lower airways becomes smaller as ventilator minute volume is increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troubleshooting-problems-with-noninvasive-positive-pressure-ventilation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Air-leaking through the mouth also contributes to sleep arousals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troubleshooting-problems-with-noninvasive-positive-pressure-ventilation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], oxygen desaturations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troubleshooting-problems-with-noninvasive-positive-pressure-ventilation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and mouth dryness. One study, for example, found that desaturations associated with air leaks disrupted sleep architecture or resulted in arousals 75 percent of the time in seven kyphoscoliotic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troubleshooting-problems-with-noninvasive-positive-pressure-ventilation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. On the other hand, another showed that NPPV adequately assists nocturnal ventilation in most patients despite air leaking during the majority of sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troubleshooting-problems-with-noninvasive-positive-pressure-ventilation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Should the leak be sufficient to interfere with ventilatory assistance or sleep, or to cause mouth dryness, addition of a chin strap may help. An oronasal mask may also be tried, but only with an anti-asphyxia valve. These masks tend to be less well tolerated than nasal masks for chronic applications, and air leaking around the mask at the chin seal may replace mouth leaking. Choosing an oral-nasal mask that seals under the chin may improve mask stability and reduce leakage.</p><p>Mouthpiece ventilation will eliminate problems with air leaking through the mouth, but air leaking through the nose may still occur and necessitate use of nasal pledgets. Although mouthpieces may interfere with swallowing, aspiration pneumonia has not been reported as a complication. Some mouthpieces are designed to be expectorated, but with strapped-on mouthpieces in quadriplegic patients, anti-asphyxia valves should be in place to prevent rebreathing in the event of ventilator failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">FAILURE TO IMPROVE DAYTIME GAS EXCHANGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients have improvements in gas exchange within weeks of initiating noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). If such improvement does not occur, consideration of the following factors may be helpful: hours of use, unintentional air leak during inspiration, residual obstructive respiratory events, asynchrony, and insufficient support of minute ventilation. Improvement may be accomplished by upward adjustments in inspiratory pressure or tidal volume, ventilator rate, duration of ventilator use, or a combination of these changes may be helpful. Adjustment of the trigger sensitivity or upward adjustment of backup rate may be helpful if there is evidence of inability to trigger the ventilator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troubleshooting-problems-with-noninvasive-positive-pressure-ventilation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Rebreathing has been identified as a potential problem when blood gases fail to improve during use of portable pressure support-type ventilators (such as bilevel positive airway pressure [BiPAP]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troubleshooting-problems-with-noninvasive-positive-pressure-ventilation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This is attributable to the use of passive exhalation valves that rely upon bias flow to flush CO<sub>2</sub> from the single ventilator tube during exhalation. Use of expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) greater than 4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (to assure adequate bias flow), switching to a nonrebreather valve, or use of masks with in-mask exhalation ports may help, although leakage through the mouth during nasal ventilation usually minimizes the problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troubleshooting-problems-with-noninvasive-positive-pressure-ventilation/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>Reasons for blood gases that do not improve, other than poor patient compliance, include excessive air leakage during inspiration, failure to eliminate apneas or hypopneas and inadequate ventilation due to inability to trigger the ventilator or provision of insufficient minute ventilation. Follow-up nocturnal monitoring in the sleep lab or at home is used to detect these problems. Most positive pressure units have the ability to measure the amount of leak, respiratory events (including apneas, hypopneas, flow limitations, and vibration or snoring) and hours of use, which may provide helpful data for further troubleshooting. However, an in-lab sleep study is considered the optimal way in which to evaluate problems with NPPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/troubleshooting-problems-with-noninvasive-positive-pressure-ventilation/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">WORSENING GAS EXCHANGE AFTER INITIAL STABILIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Worsening of gas exchange after initial stabilization is often encountered among patients with slowly progressive neuromuscular diseases. Pulmonary function studies and arterial blood gas measurements are obtained periodically to assess for deterioration. Frequency of follow-up depends on whether patients are starting therapy (every few weeks), stable on therapy (twice yearly), or deteriorating clinically (more often). Arterial blood gases need not be obtained at every visit in stable patients, but checking serum bicarbonate may be helpful as an indicator of changes in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p>Gradual increases in inspiratory pressure, tidal volume, ventilator rate, or amount of daytime use are often indicated to compensate for deteriorating pulmonary function. Problems with the equipment, such as a worn mask that no longer seals well or holes in the tubing, may contribute to ineffective therapy. Routine equipment maintenance <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> replacement are advisable. Follow-up nocturnal monitoring may also be helpful to determine whether air leaking or apneas have become problematic.</p><p>It is also helpful to review the medication list to determine if new medications, which might contribute to respiratory depression or upper airway obstruction, have been started.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although many patients have some difficulty adapting to nocturnal use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), most adapt successfully, usually within a few weeks.
