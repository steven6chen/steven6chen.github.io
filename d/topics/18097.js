A broad range of factors has been identified that can make asthma worse. These factors are often referred to as &quot;asthma triggers.&quot; Trigger exposure may occur on a chronic or episodic basis.

For patients with predictable exposures to avoidable triggers, the following interventions may be useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/trigger-control-to-enhance-asthma-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete avoidance of the trigger (eg, do not own pets if allergic to them, mop or wet wipe instead of sweeping or dusting).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit exposure to the trigger if it cannot be completely avoided (eg, leave the room if someone starts smoking, move to another seat if someone with strong perfume sits near you, have someone else dust and clean the house if you are allergic to indoor antigens).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take an extra two puffs of a short-acting bronchodilator prior to exposure to an unavoidable trigger. This approach should be implemented only if the first two options are not feasible.

Conditions that can contribute to or mimic asthma symptoms include a broad spectrum of processes, such as rhinosinusitis, obesity, deconditioning, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, paroxysmal vocal fold dysfunction, obesity, gastroesophageal reflux, sleep apnea, and mechanical restriction.

It is important that the results are interpreted in the context of other diagnostic assessments, including medical history and physical examination, because a positive skin test or in vitro test (IgE immunoassay) result only means that the patient is sensitized to that allergen and has the potential to develop symptoms when exposed to that allergen.

In some cases, behavior modification is the primary intervention (ie, avoidance of animal dander or cigarette smoke). In others, specific medical interventions may be appropriate (eg, allergen immunotherapy for patients with allergic triggers or strict avoidance of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] in patients sensitive to these drugs). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common triggers for asthma exacerbations include respiratory tract infections, airborne allergens (for patients with allergic asthma), inhaled irritants (eg, tobacco smoke), extremes of temperature and humidity (eg, very cold, dry air), and physical exercise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80507\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80507 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory infections'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Allergens'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Irritants (including cigarette smoke)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Temperature and weather'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Physical activity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Food allergens <strong>rarely</strong> cause isolated asthma without other symptoms. However, patients with food allergy may exhibit asthma symptoms as part of food-induced anaphylaxis, and inhaled food allergens can occasionally provoke asthma symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Food allergens'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of irritants can induce asthma symptoms, including cigarette smoke, fireplace smoke, ashes, aerosol sprays, perfumes, cooking odors, musty odors, shower steam, traffic fumes, air pollution, desert dust, and workplace irritants (eg, glacial acetic acid, cleaning products, chlorine). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Irritants (including cigarette smoke)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extremes of temperature and humidity can cause bronchoconstriction and increase asthma symptoms during physical activity. Other weather conditions, such as thunderstorms, cause asthma exacerbations in some patients. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Temperature and weather'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) affects 80 to 90 percent of people with symptomatic asthma, aerobic exercise has substantial health benefits and may lessen sensitivity to asthma triggers. Thus, exercise should be encouraged, <strong>not</strong> avoided. Certain interventions can reduce asthma symptoms during exercise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F105874\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105874 \">table 6</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Potential interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Worsening of asthma symptoms prior to or during menstruation, known as perimenstrual asthma, has been reported in 17 to 40 percent of women with asthma. Pregnancy can aggravate asthma in approximately one-third of women, while one-third experience no change, and one-third experience symptomatic improvement. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Hormonal fluctuations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications, such as beta-blockers (particularly nonselective beta-blockers), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and NSAIDs, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can cause asthma flares in some individuals, although ACE inhibitors more typically cause a cough without asthma. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety, depression, and chronic stress, such as exposure to community violence, are associated with greater rates of asthma exacerbations in patients with asthma. Parental depression and stress are associated with more severe asthma in children. Interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, counselling about stress management, and sometimes medication, can help ameliorate these triggers. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Emotional factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3335625558\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge William Bailey, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">National Asthma Education and Prevention Program: Expert panel report III: Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma.
