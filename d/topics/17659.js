The vast majority of patients seen in primary care (&gt;85 percent) will have nonspecific low back pain, meaning that the patient has back pain in the absence of a specific underlying condition that can be reliably identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. For most of these individuals, episodes of back pain are self-limited. Patients who continue to have back pain beyond the acute period (four weeks) have subacute back pain (lasting between 4 and 12 weeks), and some may go on to develop chronic back pain (lasting &gt;12 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>This discussion focuses on the initial treatment of nonspecific acute back pain. The treatment of acute low back pain from specific conditions is discussed in the appropriate topics. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for vertebral compression fracture (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporotic-thoracolumbar-vertebral-compression-fractures-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Osteoporotic thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures: Clinical manifestations and treatment&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for lumbosacral radiculopathy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-lumbosacral-radiculopathy-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbar-spinal-stenosis-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbar spinal stenosis: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>The evaluation of low back pain, occupational back pain, and management of patients with occupational, subacute (4 to 12 weeks), and chronic (&gt;12 weeks) back pain are also discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H3768099668\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-low-back-pain-in-adults#H460847501\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of low back pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Risk assessment subacute back pain'</a>.)</p><p>We typically advise nonpharmacologic treatment with superficial heat. Massage, acupuncture, and spinal manipulation are other reasonable options depending upon patient preference and their cost and accessibility. There are no data demonstrating superiority of one modality over another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. For patients who prefer pharmacotherapy or in whom nonpharmacologic approaches are inadequate, we suggest a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) with or without a skeletal muscle relaxant rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> for pharmacologic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3556868719\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic therapies'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>This approach is consistent with the 2017 updated guideline of the treatment of acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain from the American College of Physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>We do not advise bed rest for patients with acute low back pain. Patients who are treated with bed rest have more pain and slower recovery than ambulatory patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Activity modification should generally be minimal, with patients returning to activities of daily living and work as soon as possible. If activity is painful or increases pain, we advise patients to do as much as they can and gradually increase activity as tolerated. We emphasize the importance of avoiding prolonged periods of inactivity. However, we do not routinely refer patients with acute low back pain for exercise or physical therapy, and instead reserve those services for patients not improving with initial treatment or with risk factors for developing chronic low back pain (eg, poor functional or health status, psychiatric comorbidities). (See <a href=\"#H2761158134\" class=\"local\">'Exercise and physical therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Return-to-work recommendations should be individualized. For example, an office worker who has control over the pace of work, positioning while working, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> work hours may be able to return to work promptly. However, those with physically demanding jobs may not be able to return to work immediately if light-duty options are not available.</p><p>Return-to-work advice for patients with occupational low back pain is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occupational-low-back-pain-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occupational low back pain: Evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3556868719\"><span class=\"h1\">NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence of the effectiveness of nonpharmacologic therapies is generally of low to moderate quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The choice among these options depends upon patient preference and their cost and accessibility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H981508505\"><span class=\"h2\">Heat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heat is often applied with the rationale that it may reduce muscle spasm. A 2006 systematic review including six studies of low back pain found moderate evidence that a heat wrap may reduce pain and disability for patients with pain of less than three months&rsquo; duration, although the benefit was small and short-lived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3763386967\"><span class=\"h2\">Massage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no evidence that massage offers clinical benefits for acute low back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, a randomized trial found that compared with usual care, when massage was chosen by the patient, it was associated with increased patient satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1059984806\"><span class=\"h2\">Acupuncture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acupuncture may be a reasonable option for interested patients with access to an acupuncturist. The evidence of benefit in acute low back pain is limited. Randomized trials of acupuncture tend to be small and heterogeneous in methodology, and blinding is difficult. Systematic reviews of acupuncture for acute low back pain have found inconsistent results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Acupuncture is safe with few side effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acupuncture#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acupuncture&quot;, section on 'Adverse events'</a>.)</p><p>There is more evidence to support the use of acupuncture in chronic low back pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acupuncture#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acupuncture&quot;, section on 'Low back pain'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H328640201\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal manipulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal manipulation is a form of manual therapy that involves the movement of a joint near the end of the clinical range of motion.</p><p>Based upon the available evidence, spinal manipulation appears to confer modest improvements in pain and function. A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis of spinal manipulative therapy for acute low back pain examined 26 randomized controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Fifteen trials (1711 patients) provided moderate-quality evidence of improvement in visual analog pain scale, and 12 trials (1381 patients) showed moderate-quality evidence of improvement in function. Comparator groups were heterogeneous and included analgesics, exercise, and physical therapy. Minor transient adverse events such as increased pain, muscle stiffness, and headache were reported in 50 to 67 percent of patients. Serious adverse events (eg, worsening lumbar disc herniation, cauda equina syndrome) following spinal manipulation are rare.</p><p>Integrating spinal manipulation into the therapeutic plan for individual patients should depend upon their preferences and access to this type of intervention. There is little evidence to guide the duration of therapy. Most clinical trials have evaluated courses of twice-weekly manipulation for two to three weeks. There are no data on selecting practitioner type (eg, chiropractor, osteopath, massage therapist, physical therapist). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-manipulation-in-the-treatment-of-musculoskeletal-pain#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal manipulation in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain&quot;, section on 'Risks of spinal manipulation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2761158134\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise and physical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise therapy includes both self-care exercises done by the patient and supervised exercises in the context of physical therapy. In general, we do not refer patients with acute low back pain for exercise or physical therapy. However, we selectively refer patients with risk factors for developing chronic low back pain (eg, poor functional or health status, psychiatric comorbidities) who may benefit from immediate education by a physical therapist on how to avoid recurrences, appropriate levels of activity, and exercises to begin after the acute phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3768099668\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-based-therapy-for-low-back-pain#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise-based therapy for low back pain&quot;, section on 'Exercise for acute low back pain'</a>.)</p><p>Although some studies do show modest efficacy of exercise therapy in selected cases of acute low back pain (&lt;4 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], systematic reviews have not clearly demonstrated a treatment benefit of generalized exercise therapy compared with other conservative treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. As an example, in one systematic review of 11 randomized trials of exercise in patients with acute low back pain, exercise therapy was not more effective than no treatment or other conservative treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], which included nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs <span class=\"nowrap\">(NSAIDs)/other</span> analgesics, patient education programs, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> advice to stay active. A subsequent randomized trial in patients with back pain for 16 days or less compared four sessions of physical therapy with usual care over four weeks; the intervention led to a small improvement in a disability index score at four weeks that was not considered to be clinically significant, and no difference at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Early referral to a physical therapist may benefit patients with acute back pain who are at higher risk of developing chronic back pain, but this is unproven and may relate to education provided rather than exercise and therapy performed. While studies that have assessed such an approach showed improved outcomes for disability and lost work time, the majority of patients in these studies (&gt;80 percent) had subacute or chronic rather than acute low back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/14,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,22,23</a>].</p><p>There is evidence to support exercise therapy for patients with subacute and chronic low back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/15-17,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17,24</a>].

However, cold applied superficially does not penetrate far below the skin. A 2006 systematic review found only three studies evaluating cold for low back pain and was unable to find evidence of benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Muscle energy technique</strong> &ndash; The muscle energy technique is a treatment that involves alternating periods of resisted muscle contractions and assisted stretching.

Many NSAID options exist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70067\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70067 \">table 1</a>). We generally start with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> (400 to 600 mg four times daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> (250 to 500 mg twice daily). Doses should be decreased as tolerated.</p><p>NSAIDs provide modest symptomatic relief for acute low back pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. In a 2008 systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials, global symptomatic improvement after one week was modestly greater for patients with acute low back pain treated with NSAIDs compared with placebo (risk ratio [RR] 1.19; 95% CI 1.07-1.35) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. NSAIDs were associated with more side effects compared with either placebo or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>.</p><p>NSAIDs may have significant renal, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular adverse effects and may be contraindicated in some patients. All NSAID toxicities are more common in older patients. The adverse effects of nonselective NSAIDs and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors are discussed elsewhere.

However, evidence of efficacy has been mixed in the past [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/28,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30</a>], and a 2016 Cochrane review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-low-back-pain/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] concluded that there was high-quality evidence that acetaminophen showed no benefit compared with placebo in acute low back pain. Given that acetaminophen has clear risks and questionable benefit, we do not recommend it as initial therapy for the majority of patients with acute low back pain. In selected patients for whom there are no safe alternatives and acetaminophen is the least potentially harmful treatment, we believe it reasonable to consider a trial of acetaminophen as initial therapy.</p><p>Hepatotoxicity is the primary concern with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> use. The risk of liver injury is dose-related, but the dose causing toxicity may vary from patient to patient. Factors that can predispose patients to hepatotoxicity include chronic alcohol ingestion, medications that affect the cytochrome P2E1 (CYP2E1) enzyme system of the liver, malnutrition, and older age. In patients with risk factors for hepatotoxicity, we recommend limiting acetaminophen to &le;2 g per day. Many combination analgesics, both prescription and over-the-counter, contain acetaminophen, and the total dose of acetaminophen should be taken into account when patients are taking multiple medications.
