MM is distinguished from premalignant plasma cell dyscrasias, namely monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), by the presence of one or more myeloma-defining events, which include end-organ dysfunction (anemia, hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, and skeletal lesions) attributed to the malignant clone; &ge;60 percent clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow; <span class=\"nowrap\">involved/uninvolved</span> free light chain ratio of 100 or more; and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with more than one focal lesion involving bone or bone marrow. Patients with MM are given therapies directed at the underlying plasma cell clone with the goal of preventing further complications. In contrast, active treatment is not routinely indicated for patients with MGUS or SMM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The initial chemotherapy for patients with symptomatic MM is discussed here. A general management overview, details regarding the use and timing of autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), and the response evaluation are presented separately. In addition, the initial chemotherapy options for patients treated in resource-poor settings are presented separately.

As such, all patients with MM should be assessed at the time of diagnosis to determine whether they are eligible for autologous HCT, and the initial chemotherapy given to patients who are candidates for HCT should avoid agents that may impair stem cell collection (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Determining transplant eligibility'</a>.)</p><p>Patients who are eligible for HCT are typically treated with two to four cycles of induction therapy followed by autologous stem cell collection. Then a decision is made regarding whether to proceed with autologous HCT (early HCT strategy) or continue the same chemotherapy regimen reserving HCT for first relapse (delayed HCT strategy). Both approaches so far have produced similar overall survival rates, although comparative studies using modern regimens have had limited follow-up data. Therefore the choice is based on patient and physician preference; availability of resources to store stem cells; and patient age, clinical features, and risk stratification. Patients who are not eligible for HCT are treated with chemotherapy alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'HCT ineligible'</a>.)</p><p>Many of the immunomodulatory drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>) and proteosome inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>) used in patients with MM were initially studied in patients who were candidates for HCT. Given the high response rates and good tolerability, many clinicians have shifted towards using these as initial therapy for patients who are not eligible for HCT as well. &#160;</p><p>Among transplant candidates, a variety of different regimens have been studied. Our approach to treatment is generally consistent with that proposed by the International Myeloma Working Group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-initial-chemotherapy-for-symptomatic-multiple-myeloma/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. Our preferred initial treatment for patients with MM depends on the baseline risk stratification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97453\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97453 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>Many of the preferred treatment options have not been compared directly with each other in a randomized trial in these patient populations. As such, there is no standard of care. Data supporting their use come largely from single arm trials or randomized trials comparing these regimens with other regimens. As such, the choice among initial treatment regimens should take into consideration physician preference, risk of neuropathy, risk of thrombosis, and the patient's underlying renal function.</p><p>Patients with MM are at increased risk for the development of skeletal fractures and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Bisphosphonate therapy should be incorporated into the management of <strong>all</strong> patients receiving active therapy for symptomatic MM. In addition, all patients should have an assessment of their VTE risk so that appropriate prophylaxis may be employed. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of osteoclast inhibitors in patients with multiple myeloma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombotic-complications-following-treatment-of-multiple-myeloma-with-immunomodulatory-drugs-thalidomide-lenalidomide-and-pomalidomide\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thrombotic complications following treatment of multiple myeloma with immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5916919\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL TREATMENT OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous regimens have been tested for the treatment of newly diagnosed myeloma, both in patients who are candidates for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and in those who are ineligible for HCT. Although in the past there were differences in the type of regimen used based on transplant eligibility, this is less of a factor now. Non-melphalan containing regimens traditionally used in patients who are candidates for HCT are increasingly being used as the first choice in patients ineligible for HCT as well. The choice of initial therapy is influenced more by risk stratification. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma#H55652978\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Risk stratification'</a>.) </p><p>The most common treatment options for newly diagnosed patients are discussed in the following sections. A choice among these regimens is presented in more detail below (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97453\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97453 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5916945\" class=\"local\">'Choice of initial therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The following general principles apply:</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lenalidomide</a> plus low dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (Rd) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56451\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56451 \">table 1</a>) is an effective oral regimen for the initial therapy of MM and is incorporated into the treatment of most patients with myeloma, either alone or in combination with other agents. Prospective trials have demonstrated its efficacy in both transplant-eligible and transplant-ineligible patients. However, lenalidomide is myelosuppressive and should not be given for more than four cycles before stem cell collection in transplant-eligible patients. Lenalidomide is more difficult to dose appropriately in patients with renal failure. It has a high risk of thromboembolic complications and requires prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombotic-complications-following-treatment-of-multiple-myeloma-with-immunomodulatory-drugs-thalidomide-lenalidomide-and-pomalidomide#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thrombotic complications following treatment of multiple myeloma with immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide)&quot;, section on 'Lenalidomide in myeloma'</a>.)</p><p>The proteasome inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a> has also been used alone or in combination with other agents (eg, bortezomib, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> [VRd] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91054\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91054 \">table 2</a>)) in newly diagnosed and previously untreated patients and produces high response rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-initial-chemotherapy-for-symptomatic-multiple-myeloma/abstract/8-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-19</a>]. It is particularly useful in patients with renal failure and those with high-risk features. Frequent toxicities included sensory neuropathy (64 percent), constipation (53 percent), nausea (53 percent), and fatigue (44 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-initial-chemotherapy-for-symptomatic-multiple-myeloma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Bortezomib can be administered intravenously or subcutaneously (SC); in general, SC is preferred due to a lower risk of neuropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-multiple-myeloma#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Bortezomib'</a>.)</p><p>The triplet regimen VRd is preferred over doublet regimens such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (VD) or Rd. VD requires a twice-weekly bortezomib schedule, which is associated with a high risk of grade 3 or higher peripheral neuropathy. In contrast, the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a> permits a weekly dosing of bortezomib in the VRd regimen. In addition, initial results from a phase 3 trial suggest that VRd improves survival over that seen with Rd, although at a cost of increased toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-initial-chemotherapy-for-symptomatic-multiple-myeloma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

VRd has demonstrated tolerability and efficacy in prospective phase II studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-initial-chemotherapy-for-symptomatic-multiple-myeloma/abstract/14,17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17,20</a>].

Typically, the dosing schedule used in practice is a modification of that used in clinical trials in order to reduce neurotoxicity and dexamethasone-related toxicity. We typically use bortezomib 1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> once a week, lenalidomide 25 mg days 1 to 14, and dexamethasone 40 mg once a week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-initial-chemotherapy-for-symptomatic-multiple-myeloma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Treatments are repeated every three weeks, as tolerated.</p><p>In a multicenter phase 3 trial (SWOG S0777), 525 patients with previously untreated MM were randomly assigned to receive six months of induction therapy with either VRd or Rd, each followed by Rd maintenance until progression or unacceptable toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-initial-chemotherapy-for-symptomatic-multiple-myeloma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. VRd was associated with greater toxicity and a greater number of patients discontinuing therapy due to toxicity.

In this trial, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a> was administered intravenously. Lower rates of neurotoxicity would be expected with subcutaneous injection. </p><p>Further data regarding the use of VRd come from a phase II trial (EVOLUTION trial), in which 140 patients with newly diagnosed MM were randomly assigned to receive initial treatment with twice weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a> and weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a> (VRd), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> (VCd), or both (VDCR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selection-of-initial-chemotherapy-for-symptomatic-multiple-myeloma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Following four cycles of therapy, overall response rates were 73, 68, and 80 percent in patients who received VRd, VCd, and VDCR, respectively. Corresponding rates of very good partial response (VGPR) or better were 32, 22, and 33 percent.

This risk stratification has considerable prognostic value and also helps guide the selection of initial therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97453\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97453 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3140038\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients receive induction therapy. The duration of induction therapy depends upon the regimen used and whether the patient will proceed with autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients <strong>eligible</strong> for HCT receive induction therapy for two to four months prior to stem cell collection, depending on the intensity of the induction regimen, in order to reduce the number of tumor cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, lessen symptoms, and mitigate end-organ damage. During this time, specific arrangements for the subsequent HCT can be made to ease the transition of therapy. Melphalan-containing regimens should be avoided in all patients who are potential candidates for HCT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Autologous HCT versus chemotherapy alone'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients <strong>ineligible</strong> for HCT receiving induction <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (Rd)-based regimens generally continue Rd treatment until progression unless there is significant toxicity. In contrast, those receiving regimens that do not contain Rd are treated for approximately 12 to 18 months and then observed until progression. (See <a href=\"#H2113478118\" class=\"local\">'Lenalidomide plus low dose dexamethasone (Rd)'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most <strong>standard-risk </strong>patients, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (VRd) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91054\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91054 \">table 2</a>) rather than Rd alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). While VRd results in greater toxicity, it appears to prolong survival when compared with Rd. The all oral regimen Rd (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56451\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56451 \">table 1</a>) is an acceptable alternative for frail adults, especially those with pre-existing neuropathy, and patients age 75 years or greater who are expected to have higher rates of toxicity with VRd. Bortezomib plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and dexamethasone (VCd) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50061\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50061 \">table 3</a>) may be preferred in patients who have an increased thromboembolic risk. Lenalidomide may decrease the chances of a successful collection of peripheral blood stem cells in some patients, when stem cell mobilization is attempted using growth factor alone. (See <a href=\"#H5916952\" class=\"local\">'Standard-risk myeloma'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2315443802\" class=\"local\">'Bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone (VRd)'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with <strong>intermediate-risk</strong> MM, we recommend the use of a proteasome inhibitor-containing regimen (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Of these, we usually administer VRd (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91054\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91054 \">table 2</a>) followed by HCT. We administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a> once a week to minimize the risk of neuropathy. (See <a href=\"#H2315443802\" class=\"local\">'Bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone (VRd)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5917096\" class=\"local\">'Intermediate-risk myeloma'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with <strong>high-risk</strong> MM, the best option would be to enroll in a clinical trial since outcomes are poor with existing treatment choices. For high-risk patients who are unable to participate in a trial, we suggest the administration of a proteasome inhibitor-based induction regimen, targeting complete response as a treatment goal (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In this setting, we prefer the off-label use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carfilzomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carfilzomib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (KRd) for transplant-eligible patients and VRd for transplant-ineligible patients. For high-risk patients who are eligible for HCT, we then proceed to stem cell collection and HCT. All patients are offered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a> as maintenance therapy. (See <a href=\"#H55641103\" class=\"local\">'High-risk myeloma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be evaluated before each treatment cycle to determine how their disease is responding to therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55362\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55362 \">table 6</a>).
