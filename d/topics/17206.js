(A normal pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks.) The most common symptoms of a miscarriage are bleeding from the vagina and belly pain or cramping.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H206647621\"><span class=\"h1\">What is a threatened miscarriage?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A threatened miscarriage is when a woman has bleeding from the vagina, but her pregnancy has not actually ended. The medical term for a threatened miscarriage is a &quot;threatened spontaneous abortion.&quot;</p><p>Most of the time, the bleeding will stop on its own and the pregnancy will continue normally. But sometimes, a threatened miscarriage will become a miscarriage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H206647628\"><span class=\"h1\">Did I do anything to cause my threatened miscarriage?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You probably did not do anything to cause your threatened miscarriage. And if your threatened miscarriage becomes a miscarriage, it is also probably not because of anything you did.</p><p>Most of the time, a miscarriage happens when a pregnancy does not grow normally from the beginning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H206647635\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a threatened miscarriage?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with a threatened miscarriage have bleeding from the vagina. Some women also have pain in their belly.</p><p>There are other conditions that can cause bleeding from the vagina during the first half of pregnancy. Rarely, vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain are caused by an ectopic pregnancy. This is when the pregnancy is located in the wrong place in the body, outside the uterus. This is sometimes called a &quot;tubal pregnancy.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H206647642\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you are pregnant and have bleeding from your vagina or pain in your belly, call your doctor or nurse right away. Bleeding during pregnancy can sometimes be a symptom of an emergency condition such as an ectopic pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H206647649\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she will check for your baby's heartbeat. There are 2 main ways doctors can do this. They can use:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A device called a &quot;fetal Doppler monitor&quot; &ndash; The doctor puts this device on your belly. It uses sound waves to let you hear your baby's heartbeat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An imaging test called an ultrasound &ndash; An ultrasound uses sound waves to create pictures of the inside of your body and of your baby. This test can show pictures of your baby's heartbeat.</p><p/><p>Your doctor will probably also do a test to measure the amount of &quot;hCG&quot; (a pregnancy hormone) in your blood. You might need to have this test again a few days later.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H206647656\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a threatened miscarriage treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unfortunately, there is no one proven way to treat a threatened miscarriage.</p><p>Sometimes, doctors recommend that women with vaginal bleeding lie in bed, avoid heavy lifting, or avoid having sex. But these treatments have not been shown to help prevent a miscarriage.</p><p>If you have bleeding from your vagina, your doctor will follow your symptoms until one of the following things happen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your bleeding stops, and your doctor has made sure that your pregnancy is growing normally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a miscarriage or another problem with your pregnancy. If this happens, your doctor will talk with you about what to do next.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H206647712\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=miscarriage-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Miscarriage (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-plan-and-prepare-for-a-healthy-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to plan and prepare for a healthy pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ectopic pregnancy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=miscarriage-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Miscarriage (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-tubal-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ectopic (tubal) pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
