The vitamin K antagonist can usually be reinstituted on the night of the procedure. </p><p>Patients taking an oral direct thrombin or factor Xa inhibitor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apixaban</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edoxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edoxaban</a>) with normal renal function typically discontinue the drug one to two days prior to the procedure. These drugs have rapid onsets of action (one to three hours) and short half-lives (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F96230\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96230 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-anticoagulants-in-patients-undergoing-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Because the full anticoagulant effect of direct oral anticoagulants occurs within hours of administration and there are no reliable agents available to reverse their action, we recommend delaying for at least 48 hours the reinitiation of one of these agents when possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-patients-receiving-anticoagulants#H752909\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants&quot;, section on 'Timing of anticoagulant interruption'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-patients-receiving-anticoagulants#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants&quot;, section on 'Deciding whether to interrupt anticoagulation'</a>.)</p><p>In patients in whom a sphincterotomy has been performed, the risk of bleeding persists for three to five days, and when sessile polyps are resected, the risk of bleeding may persist for more than two weeks. Depending on the indication for anticoagulation, it is reasonable to delay attaining therapeutic levels of anticoagulation in these situations until five days or two weeks postprocedure, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">High-risk procedures, high-risk conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bridge therapy may be indicated in the periendoscopic period in patients on anticoagulants who are at high risk for thromboembolic complications, such as patients with a recent venous thromboembolism.

Heparin may be started 24 hours after achieving hemostasis in patients at high risk for thromboembolic events. These include patients with CHA2DS2-Vasc score &gt;6; mechanical valve in the mitral position or presence of both prosthetic mitral and aortic valves; venous thromboembolism within three months; thrombophilia; unprovoked venous thromboembolism; and history of venous thromboembolism in patients with active cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">URGENT PROCEDURES IN ANTICOAGULATED PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines recommend that the risk of reversing anticoagulation should be weighed against the risk of continued bleeding without reversal and thus needs to be individualized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-anticoagulants-in-patients-undergoing-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. We recommend consultation with a cardiologist or neurologist (depending on the indication for anticoagulation) prior to discontinuing anticoagulation.

In one report, successful hemostasis was achieved with endoscopic therapy in 91 percent of 52 patients with acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding after correcting the INR to 1.5 to 2.5, a success rate comparable to a control population of patients who were not anticoagulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-anticoagulants-in-patients-undergoing-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Vitamin K is less useful than fresh frozen plasma or PCC in the acute setting because of its delayed onset of action (12 to 24 hours) and the prolonged time required to reestablish therapeutic anticoagulation after its use.

The anticoagulation effect of these agents is relatively short in the presence of normal renal function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F96230\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96230 \">table 4</a>), so in some cases, if the medication is held and the patient stabilized, the bleeding may stop on its own within 12 to 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-anticoagulants-in-patients-undergoing-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, other reversal agents are being developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-anticoagulants-in-patients-undergoing-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Recommendations for managing bleeding with these agents are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-bleeding-in-patients-receiving-direct-oral-anticoagulants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of bleeding in patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of endoscopic therapy in anticoagulated patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from observational studies suggest that the success rates of endoscopic therapy for GI bleeding in patients who are mildly to moderately anticoagulated (INRs of 1.3 to 2.7) are comparable to the success rates in patients who are not anticoagulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-anticoagulants-in-patients-undergoing-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/9,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,13</a>]. Therefore, we suggest that endoscopic therapy not be withheld in these patients pending normalization of the INR. While data are lacking for patients with supratherapeutic INRs, we recommend that, whenever possible, attempts be made to lower the INR to 2.5 or less prior to endoscopic therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Resumption of anticoagulants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data are limited with regard to the appropriate timing for resuming anticoagulation following endoscopic hemostasis, but they suggest that patients who resume anticoagulation have better overall outcomes than those who do not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-anticoagulants-in-patients-undergoing-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. We resume anticoagulation once hemostasis has been achieved. If bridge therapy is required, initial anticoagulation with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> is preferable to low molecular weight heparin (which is typically used in patients who have undergone surgery) due to its relatively short half-life of 1.5 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-anticoagulants-in-patients-undergoing-endoscopic-procedures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This allows for quick discontinuation of anticoagulation in the event bleeding recurs. Oral anticoagulant therapy is initiated after the procedure if hemostasis is secured. A detailed approach to bridge therapy and resumption of oral anticoagulants is discussed in detail elsewhere.
