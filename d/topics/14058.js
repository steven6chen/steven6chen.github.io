The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) have defined probiotics as &quot;live micro-organisms, which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The environmental changes that are driving the allergy epidemic are not fully identified, although the hygiene hypothesis makes a strong case that the reduction in general microbial exposure during early childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], with corresponding changes in commensal microbiota [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], plays an important role. Normal immune homeostasis is dependent upon gut microbiota and may be influenced by differences in colonization patterns. The hygiene hypothesis provides the conceptual framework for pre- <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> postnatal dietary supplementation to prevent allergic disease by modifying early gut microbial composition, even if this hypothesis does not decisively explain all observations or provide definitive guidance on how to limit the allergy epidemic.

Gut microbiota confer specific immune-protective effects that are probably mediated through complex pathways within (and potentially even beyond) the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), the largest immune &quot;organ&quot; in humans. These effects include altered local immunoglobulin A (IgA) production and induction of tolerogenic dendritic cells and regulatory T-cell populations, with production of immunomodulatory cytokines, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These mechanisms appear to collectively inhibit local inflammation, improve gut barrier mechanisms, and consequently reduce the risk of inappropriate systemic immune responses.</p><p>Over the first months of life, there is an enormous shift from the &quot;sterile&quot; milieu in utero to microbial colonization with more than 10<sup>14</sup> organisms, outnumbering total human host cells by more than 10:1. During the same period, the functionally immature neonatal immune system must also develop to attain a complex and finely tuned balance between host defense and immune tolerance. Studies in germ-free animals demonstrate that oral tolerance cannot be induced in the absence of gut microbiota [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Although full immune function and oral tolerance can be restored by introducing normal intestinal microbiota, this is age dependent and cannot be achieved in mature animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These observations underline the essential role of gut microbiota in the development of the immune system and exemplify the importance of the timing of initial colonization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-food-allergy#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of food allergy&quot;, section on 'The gut immune system'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunity-of-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunity of the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A number of human studies have shown differences in the early colonization patterns of infants who develop allergic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Early studies reported that low levels of bifidobacteria and early colonization with potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as <em>Clostridium difficile</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>] and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], were more prevalent in children who subsequently developed allergy. Subsequent larger, prospective studies have tried to link certain bacterial genera or species to the development of allergy with conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Consequently, it has been suggested that a high gut microbial diversity might be more important than the absence or presence of specific genera or species in the context of immune system maturation and subsequent development of immune-mediated disorders. This view is supported by prospective studies that demonstrated reduced gut microbial diversity early in life in infants who later developed allergic manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4478782\"><span class=\"h2\">Proposed mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact mechanisms are not clear, but both<strong> </strong>prebiotics and probiotics probably influence immune development through a number of different pathways that can be modulated by host and environmental factors. In addition, differences in the probiotic supplement, such as the strain, dose, viability, timing, duration, adherence, and method of administration, may result in differences in clinical effect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4478789\"><span class=\"h3\">Prebiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prebiotic carbohydrates are a major substrate for bacterial growth, selectively stimulating the growth <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> activity of beneficial members of the gut microbiota, particularly bifidobacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Thus, prebiotics could, at least in theory, have more global effects on colonization than adding a single probiotic strain. A second, more direct immune effect appears to be mediated by the fermentation products of prebiotics. Gut micro-organisms ferment prebiotics to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that have direct anti-inflammatory effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. SCFAs also promote intestinal integrity through effects on epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Animal and human studies suggest that prebiotics may directly affect both mucosal and systemic immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. However, more studies are needed to confirm that these are clinically relevant effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4478796\"><span class=\"h3\">Probiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to explain the potential effects of probiotics, based upon evidence from in vitro studies and animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Probiotics may alter gut microbial composition directly, or they may act indirectly by effects on microbial products, host products, or food components, or by modulation of the host's immune system. Commensal gut bacteria can decrease local inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] and may stabilize intestinal barrier integrity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], potentially reducing systemic antigen load. Certain strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria may influence immune function through effects on enterocytes, antigen-presenting cells (including both circulating monocytes and local dendritic cells), regulatory T cells, and effector T and B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, it is uncertain how (or if) these observations translate into clinically relevant effects. In addition, it is also not known to what degree the effects of a specific bacterial strain are similar to other strains, even of the same species. Finally, the immune-stimulating effects of probiotics in in vitro studies can be divergent from those observed in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Host factors which contribute to this variability include variation in genetic predisposition to allergic disease (across multiple loci) and specific polymorphisms in microbial recognition pathways that may influence effects and susceptibility to colonization. A range of environmental factors, such as maternal microbiota, general microbial burden, mode of delivery, feeding practices and weaning diet, antibiotics, and other immunomodulatory influences may have secondary effects on colonization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1470587983\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many experts bodies such as the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Guidelines do not recommend using prebiotics, probiotics, or synbiotics for the prevention of any allergic condition, because of to the great heterogeneity in the studies and variability in results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Others, such as the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) have not given any specific recommendations on these products in their guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>In contrast, the World Allergy Organization (WAO) suggests using prebiotics only in infants who are not exclusively breastfed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] and probiotics in pregnant and lactating women and in infants when there is high risk of allergy in the children (defined as presence of a biologic parent or sibling with asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema, or food allergy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The probiotic recommendation was based upon their analysis of the data that found a net benefit of prevention of eczema, but not any other allergic outcome, with probiotic treatment. In addition, the risk of possible adverse events was felt to be low.</p><p>The timing, duration, and choice of probiotic (strain and dose) are not specified in the WAO guidelines. Probiotics were given in the last four to six weeks of pregnancy in most of the studies reviewed, but there was much greater variability in timing and duration of postnatal therapy in the infant <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> breastfeeding mother. In addition, the only probiotic strain with reproducible data is <em>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</em> GG (LGG). (See <a href=\"#H4478810\" class=\"local\">'Probiotics'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1470588706\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meta-analysis data suggest that there is a modest preventive effect of probiotics on the development of eczema, but not other atopic diseases, in at-risk infants (defined as presence of a biologic parent or sibling with asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema, or food allergy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, the great heterogeneity of the studies makes it difficult to advise on specifics regarding therapy (eg, strains, dose, timing, and duration). Thus, we suggest not giving probiotics during pregnancy, lactation, and infancy for the prevention of eczema. We do not discourage this approach, however, if parents are strongly interested, given the low risk of adverse events. Parents who chose this approach should first discuss it with the appropriate clinician (eg, obstetrician, pediatrician, other primary care provider). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4478810\"><span class=\"h2\">Probiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several meta-analyses have generally concurred that probiotics reduce the risk of eczema, but not other allergic outcomes (when examined) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/5,41-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,41-47</a>]. However, more specific conclusions have varied due in part to the wide heterogeneity of the studies included.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1470588183\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of randomized trials have evaluated the effects of probiotics in allergy prevention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F74560\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74560 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/48-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-77</a>]. Most of these studies looked primarily at early outcomes of allergic disease, such as eczema and immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy. Over one-half of these no showed significant reduction in the development of eczema, while there was benefit in the remaining studies, even when the same probiotic strain and a similar protocol were used. The majority of studies have shown no reduction in food allergy, allergic disease in general, or allergen sensitization. Few studies have assessed the long-term effects on respiratory-allergic disease (allergic rhinitis, asthma) in children greater than four to five years of age, and the results have been variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/56,58,69,71-73,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,58,69,71-73,78</a>]. In addition to variability in results, there is also considerable heterogeneity in virtually all aspects of the conducted studies, including the strains used (different single strains or combinations of strains); the dose, the timing, and duration of administration; the method of probiotic delivery; and the outcome measures. The results are conflicting even for LGG, the most extensively studied strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/48-50,56,67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50,56,67,68</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis from 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>] included 13 prevention studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/48,50,52-55,57,59-61,63,64,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,50,52-55,57,59-61,63,64,79</a>] and demonstrated that probiotic treatment reduced the incidence of eczema by 21 percent (risk ratio [RR] 0.79, 95% CI 0.71-0.88), from approximately 37 percent in the placebo group to 30 percent in the probiotic group. This effect was still present when the analysis was restricted to studies of patients with IgE-associated eczema (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66-0.96). However, this effect was seen only in the first two years of age and was lost by four years of age. Studies were reported to be fairly homogenous, and no clear difference emerged across various strata. A meta-analysis of trials through February 2014 that included 17 prevention studies reported nearly identical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. However, two subsequent randomized trials did not find a protective effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/74,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,77</a>].</p><p>In the first trial, 454 pregnant women from 36 weeks gestation and their infants to six months of age were randomly assigned to treatment with a multistrain, high-dose probiotic or placebo (infants with and without increased risk for atopy were recruited) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. There was no difference between the two groups in the cumulative frequency of diagnosed eczema at two years of age (34.1 and 32.4 percent in the probiotic and placebo groups, respectively). In the second trial, 184 high-risk infants were randomly assigned to LGG plus inulin 225 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> versus a control group with inulin alone, 325 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> for the first six months of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. At two years of age, there was no difference in the estimated cumulative incidence of eczema between the two treatment groups (29 percent in the LGG group compared with 31 percent in the control group, hazard ratio [HR] 0.95, 95% CI 0.59-1.53). The cumulative incidence of asthma was also not significantly different at five years of age (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.41-1.87). Inulin is known to have prebiotic properties, but the doses used in this study were well below that which is generally considered a prebiotic dose. Thus, it is unlikely that it would have had clinically relevant biologic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The definition of probiotics indicates that the micro-organisms must be alive to exert their effects (see <a href=\"#H3721155\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above). However, there is preliminary evidence that dead micro-organisms may also be beneficial. In a multicenter, randomized trial, 129 infants at high risk of allergy were allocated to intake of a nonhydrolyzed formula with or without the addition of heat-killed <em>Bifidobacterium breve</em> C50 and <em>Streptococcus thermophilus</em> from birth until 12 months of age for prevention of early manifestations of allergic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prebiotics-and-probiotics-for-prevention-of-allergic-disease/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. There was no decrease in the incidence of cow's milk allergy, but fewer infants were sensitized to cow's milk at 12 months in the active compared with the placebo group (1.7 versus 12.5 percent, respectively).</p><p>Further clinical studies are needed to identify if specific dosing regimens, as well as specific strains or combinations, are more effective than others.

Thus, prevention strategies are focused on pregnancy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the immediate postnatal period. Preventive measures may address the general population or target infants at high risk of developing allergic disease, characterized by a positive immediate family history of allergic disease.
