Antimicrobial therapy is initially empiric and based on the clinical situation, particularly whether the chest radiograph shows focal or diffuse opacities and whether the patient meets criteria for hospital admission. In patients presenting with typical symptoms of bacterial pneumonia with focal consolidation on chest radiograph, the initial antibiotic regimen will be directed at the most common community-acquired pathogens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial pulmonary infections in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-in-the-outpatient-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adults in the outpatient setting&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-who-require-hospitalization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adults who require hospitalization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the etiology of community-acquired pneumonia is identified using reliable microbiologic methods, antimicrobial therapy can be focused on that pathogen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64816\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64816 \">table 1</a>).

Candida pneumonia has been reported in IDUs when the injection drug is contaminated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-disease-in-injection-drug-users/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Tuberculosis (particularly multidrug-resistant tuberculosis) is more prevalent among IDUs than it is in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-disease-in-injection-drug-users/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The excess risk largely relates to covariates which are more frequent among IDUs, such as poverty, homelessness, malnutrition, HIV infection, and poor medical care. Tuberculosis should be suspected in patients with a longer prodrome, particularly in the presence of fever or night sweats for more than a week prior to presentation, or weight loss. In addition, mycobacterial disease should be suspected in patients with nonresolving pneumonia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of tuberculosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and complications of pulmonary tuberculosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonresolving-pneumonia#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonresolving pneumonia&quot;, section on 'Tuberculosis'</a>.)</p><p>The use of injection drugs is a strong risk factor for the acquisition of HIV infection. IDUs who present with pneumonia should be assessed for possible HIV infection. In the presence of known HIV infection, a variety of opportunistic pulmonary infections in addition to tuberculosis may occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-pulmonary-symptoms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the HIV-infected patient with pulmonary symptoms&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Septic emboli</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Septic pulmonary emboli can originate in the peripheral veins at sites of thrombophlebitis or they can arise from heart valves that have been damaged and infected due to injection drug use. Right-sided valve (tricuspid) endocarditis is generally found to be more common among IDUs than left-sided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-vegetation-formation-in-infective-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of vegetation formation in infective endocarditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infective-endocarditis-in-injection-drug-users#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infective endocarditis in injection drug users&quot;, section on 'Clinical evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Patients typically present with fever, but generally do not have an audible murmur or peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis. Blood cultures are usually positive. The radiographic manifestations of septic pulmonary emboli include ill-defined, nodular pulmonary opacities, cavities, abscesses, infarction, and pulmonary gangrene (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59037\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59037 \">image 1</a>). The evaluation and treatment of infective endocarditis in IDUs is discussed separately.

NPE can occur following intravenous injection of cocaine and, more commonly, opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-disease-in-injection-drug-users/abstract/3,10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10-12</a>]. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a more severe form of NPE, associated with severe hypoxemia and the need for mechanical ventilatory support. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noncardiogenic-pulmonary-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome-epidemiology-pathophysiology-pathology-and-etiology-in-adults#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, pathology, and etiology in adults&quot;, section on 'Etiologies and predisposing factors'</a>.)</p><p>The exact pathophysiology of NPE due to opioid overdose (eg, heroin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a>) is unknown, but may include a direct effect of the drug, cerebral edema (neurogenic), or possibly negative pressure. Patients with central nervous system depression due to a drug overdose can develop upper airway obstruction. Breathing against the obstruction can create a strong negative pressure across the alveoli, which causes pulmonary capillary leakage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noncardiogenic-pulmonary-edema#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema&quot;, section on 'Opioid overdose'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noncardiogenic-pulmonary-edema#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema&quot;, section on 'Neurogenic pulmonary edema'</a>.)</p><p>Patients typically present with decreased mental status and evidence of respiratory insufficiency (eg, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia). Patients with NPE due to opiate intoxication typically have severe respiratory depression requiring <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> reversal. Co-intoxication with alcohol or cocaine is present in approximately 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-disease-in-injection-drug-users/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The majority of these patients are hypoxemic on arrival in the emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-disease-in-injection-drug-users/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Imaging findings in IDUs with NPE were described in a series of 27 patients with opiate-related NPE: 74 percent had bilateral, ground-glass opacities suggestive of pulmonary edema, while unilateral pulmonary edema or focal opacities were noted in the remainder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-disease-in-injection-drug-users/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of NPE in IDUs is based on the clinical presentation and exclusion of processes in the differential diagnosis, which includes the other causes of ARDS that may complicate injection drug use, such as sepsis, pneumonia (bacterial, viral, fungal), aspiration, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and pulmonary embolism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noncardiogenic-pulmonary-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For most IDUs with NPE, treatment is supportive. Symptoms and signs typically resolve in 24 hours with supportive care (eg, supplemental oxygen), although approximately one-third of patients require mechanical ventilation for 24 to 48 hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-opioid-intoxication-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute opioid intoxication in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noncardiogenic-pulmonary-edema#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Foreign body granulomatosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug users sometimes pulverize tablets intended for oral use, dissolve them in water, and inject them intravenously. Talc, starch, cotton, and cellulose are used as filler agents in these tablets and may be carried by the bloodstream until they lodge in the pulmonary capillary bed; chronic inflammation and multiple foreign body granulomas in the lungs may ensue.</p><p>Patients may be asymptomatic or may present with nonspecific complaints such as dyspnea, cough, or an increase in sputum production. Computed tomography (CT) typically shows diffuse, small nodules (2 to 3 mm) or ground-glass opacities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53000\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53000 \">image 2</a>).

Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, a rare interstitial lung disease in the general population, is seen with increased frequency in HIV-infected individuals. In addition, organizing pneumonia, sarcoidosis, drug hypersensitivity, and immune reconstitution syndrome can develop in HIV-infected patients.

Patients who are HIV-positive may develop pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) with plexiform lesions and medial hypertrophy. The evaluation and management of pulmonary hypertension associated with HIV infection is discussed separately.

It also appears that chronic use of these drugs can lead to irreversible injury and production of a syndrome indistinguishable from primary pulmonary hypertension. In one retrospective study, patients with idiopathic PAH were ten times more likely to use stimulants (ie, amphetamines, methamphetamines, or cocaine) than patients with PAH due to known risk factors, such as collagen vascular disease, congenital heart disease, or anorexigen use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-pulmonary-disease-in-injection-drug-users/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].
