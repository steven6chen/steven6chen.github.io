It is unsurpassed in the amount of information it yields in relation to its cost, radiation dose, availability, and ease of performance. However, the chest radiograph has its limitations. It is normal in 10 to 15 percent of symptomatic patients with proven infiltrative lung disease, in up to 30 percent of those with bronchiectasis, and in close to 60 percent of patients with emphysema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In several studies, the chest radiograph has been shown to have an overall sensitivity of 80 percent and a specificity of 82 percent for detection of diffuse lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Chest radiography could provide a confident diagnosis in only 23 percent of cases, and those confident diagnoses proved correct only in 77 percent of cases.</p><p>For these reasons, high resolution computed tomography (HRCT, also called thin-section CT scanning), is frequently used to help clarify specific problems. Typical features of the lung parenchyma and of the small airways correlate with obstructive or restrictive pulmonary function tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].The clinical applications of HRCT will be reviewed here. The principles of CT imaging are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of computed tomography of the chest&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL APPLICATION OF HRCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HRCT, which has a sensitivity of 95 percent and a specificity approaching 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/2,4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-7</a>], can often provide more information than either chest radiography or conventional CT scanning. A confident diagnosis is possible in roughly one-half of cases, and these are proven correct an estimated 93 percent of the time.</p><p>HRCT may be particularly useful in the following settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It can detect lung disease in symptomatic patients with a normal chest radiograph.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It can provide an accurate assessment of the pattern, distribution, and to a lesser degree, assess the activity and potential reversibility of diffuse lung disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It demonstrates a high correlation between radiographic and histopathologic appearances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with nondiagnostic findings on chest radiography, it can provide a more specific diagnosis or exclude certain diseases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It can be used to determine the type and site of lung biopsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-lung-biopsy-in-the-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of lung biopsy in the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It can be used to detect or evaluate specific problems or diagnoses, such as metastatic lesions, solitary pulmonary nodules, emphysema, bullous lung disease, bronchiectasis, and diffuse parenchymal disease.</p><p/><p>Conventional helical CT scanning is the preferred method for the detection and evaluation of mediastinal disease, rather than HRCT (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-mediastinal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with a mediastinal mass&quot;</a>). Multislice, multidetector-row CT scanning employs routinely thin sections of 1 to 1.25 mm and high spatial frequency algorithm which provides &quot;high resolution&quot; in the vast majority of thoracic CT scans.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Resolution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The technical features of HRCT include a thin collimation of 1 to 1.25 mm and the use of a high spatial frequency (bone) algorithm. The in&ndash;plane spatial resolution of modern CT scanners can reach 0.25 mm. Thus, interlobar fissures, which are 0.15 mm in thickness, can frequently be imaged (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82418\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82418 \">image 1</a>). The pattern of scanning varies with the suspected diagnosis. Scanning should occur at 1 cm intervals for diffuse lung disease but should be limited to the involved area for focal lung processes and solitary pulmonary nodules. In posterobasal lung disease, prone scanning can eliminate gravitational changes or dependent atelectasis that can mimic lung disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66709\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66709 \">image 2</a>). Prone scans are useful in patients with subtle abnormalities or with normal chest radiographs. With current multislice, multidetector row helical CT scanners, a complete volumetric, helical data set without gaps is commonly obtained with 1 to 1.25 mm reconstructed section thickness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30085875\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basic lung unit that is regularly visible on HRCT is the secondary pulmonary lobule, which is surrounded by interlobular septa. The diameter of the secondary pulmonary lobule varies from 1 to 2.5 cm. It is formed by a congregation of three to five acini and has a polyhedral shape. It contains core structures formed by pulmonary arteriole, bronchiole and peribronchiolar lymphatics, adjacent lung parenchyma, and septal structures which can contain lymphatic structures as well. An acinus encompasses the lung unit distal to a terminal bronchiole and contains an average of 400 alveoli. It has a diameter of 5 to 10 mm and can occasionally be seen on thin sections. Centrilobular arterial branches are important for localization of pathological processes and are located 5 to 10 mm from the pleura.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HRCT PATTERNS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic approach for high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) relies upon the predominant pattern of abnormalities, on the zonal distribution of disease, on associated findings such as pleural plaques, calcifications, thickening, effusions, lymph node enlargement, and the clinical history. Criteria of importance include the chronicity of the disease process and the patient's immune status.</p><p>The basic HRCT patterns are a reflection of altered normal anatomy, including terminal and respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, pulmonary arterioles, lymphatics, and the loose interstitial connective tissue network. The patterns include reticular and nodular structures, increased opacity (ground-glass and air space filling or consolidation), and decreased opacity, including cystic lesions, mosaic attenuation, and gas trapping. Accompanying lesions include linear opacities, parenchymal bands and architectural distortion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Reticular pattern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The interstitial pulmonary network is responsible for the reticular pattern. It is composed of the axial (ie, bronchovascular) interstitium, the interlobular (ie, subpleural and sub-fissural) interstitium, and the alveolar-septal (ie, intralobular) interstitium. The pulmonary lymphatics follow the interstitial network.</p><p>A reticular pattern can be classified as large (coarse), intermediate, or fine. The large (coarse) reticular pattern (1 cm) is due to thickening of interlobular septa; intermediate reticular changes can be seen with honeycombing, which form stacked subpleural, small cystic spaces; fine reticular changes are seen with alveolar-septal, intralobular thickening. Irregular intersecting lines can produce a &quot;steel wool&quot; pattern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30085887\"><span class=\"h2\">Perilobular pattern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The perilobular region includes the bordering structures of the secondary pulmonary lobules like pleura, interlobular septa, pulmonary veins, paraseptal interstitium, paraseptal alveoli, and subpleural interstitium. Thickening of these structures can produce a coarse reticular pattern with polygonal and arcade-like opacities. The pattern has been described in up to half of patients with organizing pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Nodular pattern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nodular patterns include airspace lesions with fuzzy borders, and interstitial nodules with sharp, unsharp, or stellate margination.</p><p>Sharp interstitial nodules can be seen with [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Langerhans cell histiocytosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Silicosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metastatic disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Miliary tuberculosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disseminated fungal disease</p><p/><p>Unsharp interstitial nodules are found in [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sarcoidosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subacute phase of hypersensitivity pneumonia</p><p/><p>Stellate interstitial nodules have been described in [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Langerhans cell histiocytosis (so-called starfish nodules)</p><p/><p>Nodules can be further classified according to their distribution as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perilymphatic, </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Random, hematogenous, or perivascular </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Centrilobular &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Airspace</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Perilymphatic nodules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perilymphatic nodules are subpleural in location, and are also found along interlobular septa, interlobar fissures, and along bronchovascular bundles. These nodules tend to be nonuniform and patchy in distribution, and have a tendency to cluster. They are most frequently found in sarcoidosis, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, and silicosis. When the clustering occurs in a subpleural location, pseudo-plaques can form.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Random, hematogenous, or perivascular nodules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Random or perivascular nodules have a similar subpleural distribution, but show a uniform and diffuse distribution. They do not cluster. They are the result of hematogenous dissemination and are characteristically found in miliary tuberculosis, miliary fungal disease, septic embolization, and metastatic spread of tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75183%7EPULM%2F53000\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75183 graphicRef53000 \">image 3A-B</a>). They may have a basal predominance with centrilobular and subpleural location, as well as proximity to their feeding vessels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Centrilobular nodules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Centrilobular nodules spare the subpleural region and the lung underlying the interlobar fissures; they are found 5 to 10 mm removed from the pleural surfaces. They have a diffuse or patchy distribution, and tend to surround small vessels. They are found in hypersensitivity pneumonia, sarcoidosis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and respiratory, follicular, and cellular bronchiolitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75540\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75540 \">image 4</a>). Centrilobular nodules are described in rare cases of diffuse idiopathic neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH).</p><p>An accompanying tree-in&ndash;bud pattern is indicative of infectious bronchiolitis or aspiration. Rare causes of centrilobular nodules with tree-in-bud appearance are diffuse panbronchiolitis, follicular bronchiolitis, vascular tumor spread (tumor embolization), and so called cellulose or talc granulomatosis in intravenous drug abusers.</p><p>Centrilobular ground-glass nodules can be seen in respiratory bronchiolitis of smokers, follicular bronchiolitis, and hypersensitivity pneumonia (usually in non-smokers).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Airspace nodules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airspace nodules are centrilobular and can also form the &quot;tree-in-bud&quot; pattern, but they are slightly larger than typical centrilobular nodules. They are seen in bronchogenic spread of tuberculosis, aspiration, infectious bronchiolitis, and diffuse panbronchiolitis. The pathologic correlate is an accumulation of pus, mucus, caseous material, or inflammatory infiltration of bronchiolar walls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6946204\"><span class=\"h3\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An algorithmic approach to small nodules on HRCT can be attempted by asking, &quot;Do the nodules touch the parietal pleura or the interlobar fissures?&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If yes, then the nodules are likely to be perilymphatic or hematogenous. Clustering of the nodules suggests sarcoidosis, silicosis or lymphangitic carcinomatosis, the latter frequently with thickening of interlobular septa. Nonclustered, diffuse nodules that abut the pleural or the interlobar fissures are likely random, hematogenous nodules, eg, miliary tuberculosis, fungal dissemination, hematogenous metastatic disease, or septic embolization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If no, then the presence or absence of a tree-in-bud pattern has to be determined: centrilobular nodules without tree-in-bud pattern are found in respiratory bronchiolitis, hypersensitivity pneumonia and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Centrilobular nodules with tree-in-bud pattern are primarily found with infectious bronchiolitis and aspirations.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased attenuation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increased attenuation of lung parenchyma on HRCT is generally due to infectious or inflammatory processes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Ground glass opacification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ground-glass opacification refers to focal or diffuse veil-like opacification of the lung, which does not obscure the vascular structures or the rest of the anatomic details and does not yield air-bronchograms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F81817\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81817 \">image 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57578\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57578 \">image 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F106185\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef106185 \">image 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F116745\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef116745 \">image 8</a>). It indicates sub-threshold parenchymal abnormalities below the spatial resolution of HRCT. It has an attenuation between -300 and -600 HU. Ground-glass opacification occurs in early interstitial lung disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F106188\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef106188 \">image 9</a>), with incomplete, early alveolar filling, with increased pulmonary capillary blood volume, and with partial collapse of alveoli, particularly on expiratory scans performed close to functional residual capacity of the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. Claims that it solely represents early &quot;alveolitis&quot; have proven inaccurate. In approximately one-third of patients with interstitial lung disease, ground glass opacity correlates with established fibrosis. In such cases, accompanying traction bronchiectases can usually be detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In rare instances, increased lung attenuation may be difficult to detect if it is diffuse, homogeneous, and subtle. A very conspicuous display of bronchi (ie, the &quot;black bronchus&quot; sign) is a helpful finding that suggests diffuse, subtle increased lung attenuation. </p><p>Subtle radiographic abnormalities may be accompanied by a marked decrease in the diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of up to 50 percent, facilitating their recognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Examples of diseases that may present with subtle increased lung attenuation include early hypersensitivity pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly called Pneumocystis carinii) pneumonia, cellular nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, desquamative interstitial pneumonia, and subacute diffuse alveolar damage. In contrast, most diffuse lung diseases that present with ground-glass opacification are patchy, with multifocal variability in attenuation that is readily detected on an expiratory scan.</p><p>Acute diseases that manifest with diffuse ground-glass opacities include pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F106187\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef106187 \">image 10</a>), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, mycoplasma and viral pneumonia, acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP), acute eosinophilic lung disease, and early hypersensitivity pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Among HIV-positive patients, ground-glass attenuation is present in 90 percent of patients with Pneumocystic jirovecii pneumonia and absent in 95 percent of patients who do not have Pneumocystic jirovecii pneumonia. Among immunocompromised patients without AIDS, ground-glass opacities may indicate Pneumocystic jirovecii pneumonia, drug reactions, pulmonary hemorrhage, or lymphoma.</p><p>Chronic pulmonary disorders that induce diffuse ground-glass opacification either as the only finding or in conjunction with fibrosis, interlobular and intralobular septal thickening, or nodules include hypersensitivity pneumonia, desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, bronchioloalveolar carcinoma also called adenocarcinoma-in-situ, organizing pneumonia, and sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>&quot;Crazy Paving&quot; refers to ground-glass opacities with interspersed thickened interlobular and intralobular septa. Initially described in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, it can also be found in atypical pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, diffuse alveolar damage, and pseudoalveolar sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ground glass opacities may be focal. Such opacities typically represent focal atelectasis, focal fibrosis, focal inflammation, atypical alveolar hyperplasia, or bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (ie, adenocarcinoma-in-situ) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Follow-up scans after three months may show clearing if the focal ground glass opacity is inflammatory in origin. However, if the focal ground glass opacity persists and exceeds 10 mm in diameter, bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (adenocarcinoma-in-situ) should be suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Smaller, circumscribed, persistent ground-glass opacities usually represent atypical alveolar hyperplasia. They grow in only 10 percent of cases and only 1 percent can yield a solid component and convert to a minimally invasive adenocarcinoma. This conversion takes at least 3.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Consolidation or airspace filling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consolidation or airspace filling causes opacification but, in contrast to ground-glass attenuation, it results in obscuration of vascular structures accompanied by air bronchograms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57246%7EPULM%2F70172\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57246 graphicRef70172 \">image 11A-B</a>). These changes are due to replacement of alveolar gas by pus, edema, blood, surfactant, or cells. In acute cases, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, diffuse alveolar damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and pulmonary hemorrhage should be considered. In chronic cases, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (mucinous adenocarcinoma) are likely possibilities. </p><p>In rare cases, an interstitial process such as sarcoidosis can widen the alveolar septa and compress the alveoli but spare the bronchi, thus mimicking airspace filling disease (ie, pseudoalveolar sarcoidosis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased attenuation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decreased attenuation can result from emphysema, cystic lung disease, asthma, bronchiolitis obliterans with hypoxic vasoconstriction, bronchial obstruction with gas trapping due to a check valve obstruction, or pulmonary hypoperfusion from severe pulmonary hypertension, particularly if it is due to chronic thromboembolic disease (CTEPH). A generalized decrease in attenuation is unusual, but may be seen with increasing age due to an increase in the size of alveoli from 250 micrometers to 500 micrometers in diameter. It may also be seen in individuals with pulmonary arterial hypertension or a systemic sclerosis-related pulmonary vasculopathy, likely reflecting reduced compliance of the pulmonary arterial tree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Mosaic attenuation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Redistribution of blood flow towards normal parts of the lung may lead to increased attenuation of uninvolved parenchyma. This pattern of variable regional attenuation of lung parenchyma due to regional differences in perfusion is known as mosaic perfusion or mosaic attenuation and leads to sharply defined heterogeneity of lung attenuation. It can result from regional variations in perfusion due to vascular disease, airway abnormalities with hypoxic vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], or areas of infiltrative lung disease with ground-glass attenuation interspersed between islands of normal lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. It can be seen in up to 20 percent of abnormal HRCT studies performed for diffuse infiltrative lung disease.</p><p>Differentiation of increased attenuation due to focal increase in blood flow from true ground-glass attenuation can be made by evaluating the vessel size: vessel size and number will be equal in areas of increased and decreased attenuation when caused by infiltrative lung disease. Vessel size and number will be decreased in regions of hypoattenuation, when dealing with airways or vascular disease. Expiratory scans will amplify the areas of hypoxic vasoconstriction and gas-trapping in airways disease but will not affect regions of hypoperfusion resulting from vascular obstruction. In addition, bronchiolitis obliterans is frequently associated with bronchial wall thickening, bronchiectasis, bronchiolectasis, and lobular lucencies, whereas chronic thromboembolic disease and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension are accompanied by dilation of the central pulmonary arteries and larger, better defined areas of hypoattenuation. Mosaic attenuation will accurately depict 95 percent of diffuse infiltrative diseases and 85 percent of small airways obstruction but only 40 percent of patients with chronic obstruction of pulmonary arterial branches.</p><p>Lobular gas or air trapping has been described in 40 to 60 percent of asymptomatic, nonsmoking individuals. It can be regarded as a normal variant, particularly on expiratory scans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Lung affected by gas or air trapping usually shows a decrease in attenuation below minus 856 HU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Cystic lung disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cysts are defined as focal regions of low attenuation with perceptible, well delineated walls. Emphysematous spaces and bullae usually have an imperceptible wall and occasionally central vessels. Bronchiectatic cysts display the signet ring or Cabochon ring sign due to an accompanying artery in their wall. Cysts can be seen in end-stage lung disease with honeycombing in IPF, collagen-vascular diseases with fibrosing alveolitis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP) with follicular bronchiolitis, and, rarely, in desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP).</p><p>The cysts in IPF characteristically are subpleural in location and multilayered, stacked or multi-tiered. In Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), they are typically associated with nodules, have irregular, bizarre shapes, are diffusely or randomly distributed throughout the lung parenchyma, predominant in the upper and middle lung regions, and tend to spare the lung bases.

Sharply defined or stellate centrilobular nodules are the initial finding on HRCT.

Some of these cysts can resemble emphysematous bullae; the differentiating features are the slightly thicker wall and their diffuse location, permeating the entire cross-section of the lung parenchyma rather than the peripheral, subpleural region of the lung. The cysts have bizarre, irregular shapes, which can appear in combination with nodules in the intermediate stages of the disease. Their etiology is not clear, but they seem to result from cavitation of nodules or represent dilated airways, imaged in cross-section.

These interstitial findings in smokers may represent a mild form of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, fibrosis subtype, and may indicate premature aging of the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs/abstract/14,63,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,63,86</a>]. Of note, smoking can be protective of hypersensitivity pneumonia and sarcoidosis with an odds ratio for these diseases of 0.62. This protection may be the result of mild immunosuppression triggered by smoking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High resolution computed tomography (HRCT, also called thin-section CT scanning) provides more detail than either chest radiography or conventional CT scanning, with an overall sensitivity of 95 percent and a specificity approaching 100 percent. Compared to chest radiography, HRCT can more accurately assess the pattern and distribution of diffuse lung disease, which may be beneficial when trying to narrow the differential diagnosis or define a target for lung biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical application of HRCT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>HRCT patterns include linear and reticular opacities, nodular opacities, large confluent opacities (eg, ground-glass opacities, consolidation), and decreased parenchymal opacity (eg, emphysema, cystic lesions, mosaic attenuation, gas trapping). These patterns may be accompanied by parenchymal bands and architectural distortion. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'HRCT patterns'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Distributions of disease include apical versus basal, central versus peripheral, anterior versus posterior, and diffuse. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'HRCT disease distribution'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major diseases that can be optimally characterized by HRCT include emphysema, bullous disease, airways diseases (eg, bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis), lymphangitic carcinomatosis, sarcoidosis, the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, asbestosis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP, now called Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia), and hypersensitivity pneumonia.
