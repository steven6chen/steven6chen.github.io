Muscular contractions produce &quot;positive myoclonus,&quot; whereas muscular inhibitions produce &quot;negative myoclonus&quot; or asterixis. Myoclonic movements have many possible etiologies, anatomic sources, and pathophysiologic features. Treatment is generally guided by the anatomic and physiologic classification of the myoclonus in question.</p><p>This topic will review the treatment of myoclonus. The treatment of myoclonic epilepsy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epilepsy-syndromes-in-children#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epilepsy syndromes in children&quot;, section on 'Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epilepsy-syndromes-in-children#H864542\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epilepsy syndromes in children&quot;, section on 'Myoclonic epilepsy of infancy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epilepsy-syndromes-in-children#H863375\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epilepsy syndromes in children&quot;, section on 'Absence epilepsies'</a>.)</p><p>Other clinical aspects of myoclonus are reviewed elsewhere.

The classification of myoclonus is reviewed here briefly, and is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and evaluation of myoclonus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=symptomatic-secondary-myoclonus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Symptomatic (secondary) myoclonus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most useful scheme for therapeutic decisions classifies myoclonus by the localization of the physiologic mechanism that generates it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62397\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62397 \">table 1</a>). These anatomic-physiologic categories (along with important examples) are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cortical myoclonus (eg, posthypoxic myoclonus, progressive myoclonus epilepsy and progressive myoclonus ataxia syndromes, most cases of toxic-metabolic myoclonus, myoclonus associated with neurodegenerative disease, and myoclonus associated with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cortical-subcortical myoclonus (eg, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subcortical-nonsegmental myoclonus (eg, myoclonus-dystonia syndrome)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Segmental myoclonus (eg, palatal myoclonus)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral myoclonus (eg, hemifacial spasm)</p><p/><p>In addition to providing guidance for treatment, this classification paradigm is useful for localization of the underlying lesion and for the diagnosis of certain disorders that have a characteristic myoclonus physiology.</p><p>Another scheme classifies myoclonus into four broad clinical-etiologic categories as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78331\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78331 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiologic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Essential</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epileptic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic (secondary)</p><p/><p>Each of these categories contains myoclonus arising from various specific etiologies and pathophysiologic mechanisms. Thus, differentiation by clinical-etiologic category is not always pure.</p><p>The ideal way to control myoclonus is to treat the underlying disorder, as this may partly or totally reverse certain types of myoclonus. Examples include myoclonus caused by an acquired abnormal metabolic state, a removable medication or toxin, an excisable lesion, or a psychogenic etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myoclonus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>With most types of myoclonus, however, treatment of the underlying disorder is impossible or ineffective. In these cases, symptomatic treatment is justified if the myoclonus is disabling. Unfortunately, there is sparse evidence from controlled clinical trials to direct myoclonus therapy, in part because no drug has been designed or marketed specifically for the purpose of treating myoclonus. Nearly all of the evidence comes from observational case reports and case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myoclonus/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Given the limited available data regarding the treatment of individual etiologies of myoclonus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78331\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78331 \">table 2</a>), our approach to symptomatic therapy is guided mainly by the underlying physiologic classification of the myoclonus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62397\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62397 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and evaluation of myoclonus&quot;, section on 'Anatomic and physiologic classification'</a>.)</p><p>This strategy is based upon the premise that an agent or treatment that is effective for one type of myoclonus is likely to be effective for other causes of myoclonus that share the same underlying physiologic mechanism. Furthermore, an agent or treatment that is effective for one physiologic type of myoclonus may be less effective or ineffective for another physiologic type, or may even cause worsening.</p><p>Some clinical phenotypes of myoclonus have more than one potential physiologic mechanism. In cases when the myoclonus physiologic classification cannot be determined, presuming the myoclonus physiology that usually occurs in that diagnosis is a reasonable way to proceed. As examples, a cortical myoclonus physiology may be presumed in a child with Unverricht-Lundborg disease confirmed by genetic testing (EPM1 mutation) and in an adult with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease who cannot cooperate with electrophysiology testing.</p><p>When both the specific etiology and myoclonus physiology are uncertain, treatments that have evidence of effectiveness for cortical myoclonus can be tried first, since a cortical physiology is the most common mechanism for myoclonus. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Cortical myoclonus'</a> below.)</p><p>Myoclonus treatment is often unsuccessful from the viewpoint of the patient. High expectations for a marked decrease or total elimination of myoclonus are usually unrealistic. In addition, multiple medication trials are sometimes necessary to find the best drug or drug combination to control myoclonus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large number of medications, mainly anticonvulsants, have been used to treat myoclonus, but few have been evaluated in rigorous clinical trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Levetiracetam</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although no randomized controlled trials are available, there is limited evidence from small open-label studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myoclonus/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>], case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myoclonus/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>], and case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myoclonus/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>] that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a> is effective or partially effective for various causes of cortical myoclonus. Patients treated in these studies included those with progressive myoclonic epilepsy and progressive myoclonic ataxia syndromes (due to Unverricht-Lundborg disease, Lafora disease, and myoclonus epilepsy with red ragged fibers), benign adult familial myoclonic epilepsy, asterixis (ie, negative myoclonus), posthypoxic myoclonus, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The myoclonus in corticobasal degeneration is usually very difficult to treat, though a case report of a woman with probable corticobasal degeneration observed that treatment with levetiracetam was associated with marked improvement in myoclonus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myoclonus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The best-designed of these uncontrolled studies was an open-label evaluation of add-on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a> (mean dose 3214 mg daily after titration phase) for the treatment of chronic refractory cortical myoclonus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myoclonus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Compared with the pretreatment phase, all 14 patients who completed the study had significant improvement in myoclonus, as assessed by the Unified Myoclonus Rating Scale (UMRS). However, there was no significant change in the negative myoclonus (asterixis) scores of the UMRS.</p><p>In one report, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a> was beneficial for three patients with spinal segmental myoclonus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myoclonus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Levetiracetam</a> is initiated at 500 to 1000 mg daily given in two divided doses. It can be titrated up by 1000 mg every two weeks as needed, up to 3000 mg daily. If well tolerated and response is suboptimal, a maximum daily dose of 4000 mg can be tried. Therapeutic levetiracetam doses for myoclonus usually range between 1000 mg to 3000 mg daily.</p><p>The most common adverse events associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a> are fatigue, somnolence, dizziness, and infection (upper respiratory). Most adverse events are mild to moderate in intensity and typically occur during the initial titration phase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59755%7ENEURO%2F78896\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59755 graphicRef78896 \">table 3A-B</a>).

As an example, a six-week randomized double-blind crossover trial involving 20 adults with Unverricht-Lundborg disease, a cause of progressive myoclonic ataxia, reported that the highest dose of piracetam (24 g daily given in two divided doses) was significantly more effective than placebo for improvement in the primary outcome measure (the mean sum score of six components of a myoclonus rating scale) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myoclonus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The improvement was considered clinically relevant. Lower doses of piracetam (16.8 and 9.6 g daily) were associated with a nonsignificant improvement in the primary outcome measure.</p><p>Piracetam is usually started at 2.4 g daily, given in three divided doses. Therapeutic doses of piracetam range between 2.4 g to 24 g daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myoclonus/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>].

Clonazepam doses as high as 15 mg daily are often necessary but should be introduced slowly.</p><p>The most common side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a> are drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, and sedation. These can sometimes be ameliorated by adjusting the dose. Abrupt reductions or withdrawals of clonazepam can cause both an exacerbation of myoclonus and withdrawal seizures. As with other benzodiazepines, clonazepam may produce physical and psychological dependence. In addition, tolerance with loss of effectiveness may develop over a period of several months in some patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Valproic acid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence from uncontrolled observational studies suggests that valproic acid (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>) is effective for various types of cortical myoclonus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myoclonus/abstract/2,20,21,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,20,21,27</a>].</p><p>In a few case reports, valproic acid treatment was associated with improvement in palatal myoclonus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-myoclonus/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>Valproic acid is introduced slowly, starting at 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily in three divided doses.
