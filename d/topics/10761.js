This topic reviews short-term outcomes, including sustained weight loss, medical comorbidities, psychosocial difficulties, and health care expenditure, following the three most commonly performed bariatric operations: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), and adjustable gastric band (AGB).</p><p>Obesity is a worldwide epidemic, affecting children, adolescents, and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. For example, the 2010 National Health and Examination Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention demonstrated that 33.8 percent of adults in the United States and Canada are classified as obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Bariatric surgery remains the only effective sustained weight loss option for morbidly obese patients, and the performance of bariatric surgical procedures has significantly increased in the last 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. </p><p>The American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) estimated that in 2008 alone, 220,000 people in the United States underwent a weight loss operation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition to achieving weight loss, bariatric procedures result in marked improvement or resolution of many obesity-related health problems, such as type II diabetes. However, the guidelines published by the American Heart Association (AHA), American College of Cardiology (ACC), and The Obesity Society (TOS) indicate that there is insufficient evidence at present to recommend bariatric or metabolic surgical procedures as primary treatment for type 2 diabetes independent of body mass index criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

Factors involved with this high degree of variation in weight loss remain to be elucidated. This table shows the expected short-term weight loss following individual bariatric procedures as the percentage of excess weight lost for patients undergoing a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), or adjustable gastric band (AGB) procedure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F90583\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90583 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p>Excess body weight is defined as the amount of weight that is in excess of the ideal body weight. Ideal body weight is conventionally determined by the Metropolitan Life Tables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] or as a body mass index (BMI) &lt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</span> </sup>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]<sup> </sup>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2924279943\"><span class=\"h2\">RYGB and SG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients undergoing RYGB or SG, weight loss occurs rapidly over the first few months, then continues over the next year to year and a half until weight loss reaches a plateau. During the first six months after RYGB, the average weight loss is 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 7 kg) per month. Thus, average weight loss at the six-month follow up visit is 60 to 80 lb (27 to 36 kg). Thereafter, the rate of weight loss tends to slow down to 5 to 7 lb (2 to 3 kg) per month, and total weight loss reaches a peak at 12 months postoperatively, averaging 100 to 120 lb (45 to 54 kg).</p><p>In a retrospective study of 651 patients who were followed for at least 10 years after RYGB (approximately half laparoscopic, half open), the percent reduction in excess body mass index gradually increased to a peak of 74 percent at two years, before it slowly trended down to 52 percent at 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. At 10 years, the prevalences of obesity-related illnesses remained significantly reduced compared with the baseline. </p><p>As the popularity of laparoscopic SG (LSG) has increased substantially in the recent decade, its efficacy in promoting weight loss has been measured against laparoscopic RYGB (LRYGB) in multiple randomized trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Swiss multicenter randomized trial (SM-BOSS) of 217 obese patients with BMI between 35 and 61 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> there was no significant difference in weight loss at one, two, or five years after LRYGB compared with LSG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. At five years, patients maintained 61.1 percent excess BMI loss with LSG versus 68.3 percent excess BMI loss with LRYGB. Overall, 16 of 101 patients (15.8 percent) who underwent LSG required a reoperation (9 of 16 for severe gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD]), while 23 of 104 patients (22.1 percent) who underwent LRYGB required a reoperation (9 of 23 for internal hernia). There were no significant differences in major medical outcomes (eg, remission of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension), except that GERD symptoms improved significantly in patients who had undergone LRYGB but worsened in patients who had undergone LSG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Finnish multicenter randomized trial (SLEEVEPASS) of 240 patients with severe obesity, patients who had undergone LRYGB had slightly greater percentage excess weight loss than patients who had undergone sleeve gastrectomy at all points, including at five years: 50 percent after LSG versus 57 percent after LRYGB. In total, 10 of 121 patients (8.3 percent) required reoperation after LSG, most often (7 of 10) for severe GERD, and 18 of 119 patients (15.1 percent) required reoperation after LRYGB, most often (17 of 18) for internal hernia. Patients who had undergone LRYGB required fewer antihypertensive medications at five years; there were no statistically significant differences in terms of diabetes outcomes and discontinuation of lipid-lowering medications. Changes in GERD symptoms were not reported by this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p>Although the two randomized trials drew different conclusions because of different study designs, it is clear from the data that the efficacies of LSG and LRYGB are quite similar: there was only a 1-BMI-unit difference in weight loss between the two procedures at five years, which may not be clinically meaningful, and there was no significant difference in diabetes remission rates in either trial. LSG and LRYGB, however, differ in complication profiles: most of the reoperations after LSG were for severe GERD, and those after LRYGB for internal hernias; GERD symptoms worsened after LSG but improved after LRYGB. Given the relative parity between these procedures in promoting weight loss and comorbidity resolution, the choice of LSG versus LRYGB may depend upon which potential risk or consequence is more acceptable to the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>LSG and LRYGB are discussed in detail in other topics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-sleeve-gastrectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3132426071\"><span class=\"h2\">AGB</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who undergo an adjustable gastric band (AGB) procedure, weight loss is slower, with an anticipated one-pound-per-week weight loss until stabilization is reached at approximately two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Although most patients do well initially, some ultimately fail to sustain their improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Some AGB patients may not ever achieve significant weight loss. This highlights the importance of establishing a fundamental lifestyle change during the first one to two years after surgery in order to achieve long-term success in maintaining weight loss. Because of it poor efficacy, AGB is rarely performed in contemporary bariatric practice.

Improvement in metabolic control is often evident within days to weeks following RYGB, most likely reflecting an alteration in metabolism that is independent of weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. A glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) mediated mechanism has been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Metabolic control following AGB placement occurs later in the postoperative period and is variable following an SG. A description of bariatric operations is reviewed separately.

Data at three and five years are consistent with these one-year results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The pre-trial mean glycated hemoglobin level was 9.2&plusmn;1.5 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Bariatric surgical procedures were performed laparoscopically.

Obese patients (BMI &ge;35) with a history of diabetes for five or more years and a glycated hemoglobin level &ge;7.0 percent undergoing an RYGB or biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) were significantly more likely to achieve the study endpoint of remission of diabetes at two years compared with patients managed by medical therapy alone (75 versus 95 versus 0 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. At five years, however, 8 of 15 patients in the RYGB group and 7 of 19 patients in the BPD group developed recurrent diabetes after initially achieving remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Nevertheless, the proportion of patients who were diabetes-free at five years was still higher with bariatric surgery than with medical management (50 versus 0 percent). Although surgical (RYGB and BPD) patients lost more weight than medically treated patients, weight loss did not predict diabetes remission or relapse in that study.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial (Diabetes Surgery Study) of 120 obese adults with type 2 diabetes compared intensive lifestyle interventional and medical management with or without RYGB in achieving a composite primary endpoint of glycated hemoglobin A1c level of &lt;7 percent, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> and systolic blood pressure of &lt;130 mmHg. In the first year after randomization, more patients in the surgical group achieved the composite triple endpoint (50 versus 16 percent), an advantage attributed primarily to superior weight loss with surgery (26 versus 9 percent of initial body weight) by regression analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Success in achieving the primary endpoint was reduced in both groups from year 1 to year 3, from 50 to 23 percent in the surgical group and from 16 to 4 percent in the nonsurgical group, then remained stable for years 3 through 5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Glycemic control is likely the primary contributor to the improvement in the surgical composite triple endpoint. At five years, although more patients in the surgical group achieved hemoglobin A1c level of &lt;7 percent than in the nonsurgical group (55 versus 14 percent), both rates were reduced from the corresponding one-year values (83 percent surgical versus 29 percent nonsurgical). Given that weight loss was durable following cessation of intensive lifestyle modification and medical management modification at the end of two years, worsening metabolic control of diabetes at five years in both groups indicates that improving diabetes control for the long term may involve other factors. In addition, there were more serious adverse events in the surgical group at year 1 (22 versus 15) and year 5 (104 versus 38) than in the nonsurgical group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial compared RYGB, AGB, and lifestyle modification in 61 obese type 2 diabetic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. At three years, rates of partial or complete remission of diabetes were significantly higher with bariatric surgery (40 percent with RYGB, 29 percent with AGB, and 0 percent with lifestyle modification). More patients who underwent surgery ceased taking their diabetes medications (65 percent with RYGB, 33 percent with AGB, and 0 percent with lifestyle modification). </p><p/><p>Results following RYGB operation are promising for patients with BMI &lt;35 and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes; several trials are in progress to evaluate the procedure in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Efficacious control of type 2 diabetes has also been demonstrated following an SG or an AGB.</p><p>In 2011, the American College of Surgeons Bariatric Surgery Center Network (ACS-BSCN) found that the remission or improvement was for patients undergoing RYGB, SG, and AGB. In a prospective, longitudinal study that included bariatric-specific data from more than 100 participating institutions and 28,616 obese diabetic patients, remission or improvement in diabetes at 12 months was achieved in 83 percent of patients undergoing an RYGB, 55 percent undergoing SG, and 44 percent undergoing an AGB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This result has been corroborated by other studies demonstrating one-year remission or improvement of diabetes in 40 to 75 percent of patients who underwent an SG or an AGB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. SG is an alternative procedure to RYGB for patients with BMI &lt;50, the extremes of ages, and smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In addition to glycemic control, improvement in distal peripheral neuropathy was identified following RYGB. A pilot study that included 12 patients with documented distal peripheral neuropathy (DPN) found improvement or normalization of the Neuropathy Symptom Score (NSS) and the Neuropathy Deficit Score (NDS) in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

A randomized trial that included 120 obese patients (BMI 30.0 to 39.9) found that patients undergoing an RYGB (n = 60) plus intensive lifestyle medical management were able to achieve a similar reduction in systolic blood pressure at 12 months compared with patients managed with lifestyle medical modification alone (84 versus 79 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

In a retrospective review of 236 patients undergoing an SG using liver function tests as a surrogate marker for NASH, there was a 50 percent reduction in preoperative transaminase levels at 6 and 12 months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. In other small retrospective studies, NASH and fibrosis resolved in up to 86 to 90 percent of patients within two years after bariatric surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>].

However, although liver functional tests, specifically alanine aminotransferase (ALT), are widely used to screen for liver disease, they did not reliably exclude obesity-related liver disease (eg, NASH) in patients undergoing bariatric surgery, according to a study of 700 patients in the LABS-1 and -2 studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>].

In an Israeli retrospective cohort study of over 8000 patients who underwent RYGB, laparoscopic SG (LSG), and laparoscopic AGB compared with over 25,000 matched obese but nonsurgical patients, the all-cause mortality was lower with bariatric surgery at a median follow-up of 4.3 years (1.3 versus 2.3 percent). The absolute difference was 2.51 (95% CI 1.86-3.15) fewer deaths per 1000 person-years in the surgical versus nonsurgical group. Adjusted hazard ratios for mortality among nonsurgical versus surgical patients were 2.02 (95% CI 1.63-2.52) for all procedures, 2.01 (95% CI 1.50-2.69) for laparoscopic AGB, 2.65 (95% CI 1.55-4.52) for RYGB, and 1.60 (95% CI 1.02-2.51) for laparoscopic SG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>].</p><p>As a result of improved cardiovascular profiles, long-term studies, which included patients who underwent bariatric procedures, demonstrated a 56 percent reduction in cardiovascular deaths and a 50 to 60 percent reduction in the incidences of myocardial infarction and cerebral vascular accidents as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/121,122\" class=\"abstract_t\">121,122</a>]. </p><p>Studies using the Swedish Obese Subjects Database associated bariatric surgery with a reduction of cancer risk over 20 years from 6 to 3.9 percent, and the effect was more pronounced in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-outcomes-following-bariatric-surgery/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H353466706\" class=\"local\">'Medical comorbidities'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss is highly variable following each procedure. Factors involved with this high degree of variation of weight loss remain to be elucidated.

Long-term durability has not been established.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For select obese patients with uncontrolled diabetes, we perform an RYGB in addition to medical therapy. Improvement in metabolic control is often evident within days to weeks after RYGB, most likely reflecting an alteration in metabolism that is independent of weight loss. (See <a href=\"#H353466713\" class=\"local\">'Diabetes mellitus'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions#H288840505\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric procedures for the management of severe obesity: Descriptions&quot;, section on 'Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic control following a SG is more variable. The BPD, performed at only a few specialized centers, is preferred by some bariatric surgeons.

For most obese patients with long-standing or poorly controlled GERD who are operative candidates, we perform an RYGB for symptomatic control. Approximately 70 percent of patients achieve symptom improvement or resolution at one year following RYGB. It is likely, but not proven, that the AGB and SG are ineffective in controlling GERD.

For obese patients that fail or cannot conform to intensive lifestyle medical modification with hypertension, we individualize operative management.
