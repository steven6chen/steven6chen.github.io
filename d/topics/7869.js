Localized GA, which classically presents as a nonscaly, erythematous, annular plaque on the distal extremity is the most common form of GA. The generalized form of GA, which accounts for approximately 15 percent of cases, typically presents with numerous erythematous papules and plaques on the trunk and extremities. Less common forms of GA include subcutaneous, perforating, and patch variants.</p><p>Many cases of GA resolve spontaneously within a few years, and treatment is only indicated for patients who have symptomatic lesions or cosmetic concerns. Localized lesions are usually treated with topical or intralesional corticosteroids. Options for the treatment of generalized GA include topical therapies, phototherapy, and systemic medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35143167\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact prevalence of GA is unknown, but it has been estimated that approximately 0.1 to 0.4 percent of new patients who present to dermatologists have GA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Localized GA most frequently occurs during the first three decades of life, although it is not limited to this demographic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In contrast, generalized GA frequently presents during the fourth to seventh decades. </p><p>Subcutaneous GA, patch GA, and perforating GA are less common manifestations of this disorder. Subcutaneous GA is most common in children, while the patch type has primarily been reported in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Perforating GA is a rare variant that may occur in both adults and children, and appears to have an increased prevalence in the Hawaiian Islands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. </p><p>In general, women appear to be at increased risk for GA. Among cases of localized GA, the ratio of females to males is estimated to be approximately 2.5 to 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A retrospective study of 100 patients with generalized GA also noted a female predominance; the ratio of females to males was 2.9 to 1 among patients with predominantly annular lesions, and 1.4 to 1 among patients with generalized papular GA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35143174\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the cause of GA is unknown, a variety of potential inciting factors have been reported, including trauma, insect bites, tuberculin skin testing, vaccinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], sun exposure, drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>], subcutaneous immunotherapy for allergic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and various viral infections (eg, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Epstein-Barr virus, HIV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A study that sought evidence for an infectious etiology was unable to confirm infection as a contributor to GA; bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal DNA was absent in biopsy specimens from all 10 patients with GA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Moreover, cultures for these organisms taken from five tissue specimens and serologic tests for <em>Borrelia </em>performed in seven patients were negative. </p><p>Multiple cases in which GA developed within scars from herpes zoster have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. The relationship between GA and systemic diseases remains unclear. (See <a href=\"#H19690202\" class=\"local\">'Associated disorders'</a> below.) </p><p>It is also uncertain whether genetic factors influence susceptibility to GA. Familial cases have been documented, but studies investigating associations of the disease with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have yielded inconsistent results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Increased frequency of HLA-B35 in patients with generalized GA has been reported in two studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>A dermal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate and degenerated collagen are typical histopathologic findings in GA, and may offer clues to the pathogenesis of this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction in which Th1 lymphocytes stimulate macrophages to express proinflammatory cytokines and collagen-degrading enzymes may play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Injury to dermal elastic fibers has also been proposed as an inciting factor for GA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Immune-mediated vasculitis was thought to be a contributing factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]; however, subsequent studies have not identified vasculitis as a prominent feature in GA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35143181\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GA can present with a variety of clinical findings. Shared histopathologic features support the classification of these clinical variants into a single disorder. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35143190\"><span class=\"h2\">Localized GA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As the most common form of GA, localized GA classically presents as an asymptomatic, skin-colored or erythematous, annular or arciform plaque with a moderately firm, rope-like border and central clearing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F76216%7EDERM%2F62354%7EDERM%2F73823%7EDERM%2F62598\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76216 graphicRef62354 graphicRef73823 graphicRef62598 \">picture 1A-D</a>). Discrete 1 to 2 mm papules may be noted at the periphery of lesions that have not developed a continuous border. In a minority of cases, papules may also be present centrally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F61039\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61039 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>Lesions of localized GA typically grow slowly in a centrifugal pattern; most lesions are less than 5 cm in size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The most frequent locations for localized GA are the wrists, ankles, dorsal hands, and dorsal feet. Involvement of the palms is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Approximately 50 percent of patients will have more than one lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Infrequently, localized GA may also present as clusters of small papules without an annular or arcuate configuration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35143197\"><span class=\"h2\">Generalized GA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generalized GA presents with widespread, skin-colored to erythematous papules and plaques, ranging from millimeters to a few centimeters in diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F71308%7EDERM%2F77002%7EDERM%2F51459%7EDERM%2F64223%7EDERM%2F53172%7EDERM%2F53898\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71308 graphicRef77002 graphicRef51459 graphicRef64223 graphicRef53172 graphicRef53898 \">picture 3A-F</a>). Annular plaques are present in up to two-thirds of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/6,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,28</a>]. The trunk and extremities are prominent sites of involvement in generalized GA, while the head, neck, palms, soles, and mucous membranes are generally spared. Involved skin may be asymptomatic or pruritic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35143204\"><span class=\"h2\">Subcutaneous GA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Single or multiple, deep dermal or subcutaneous, painless nodules on the scalp or extremities are the hallmark of subcutaneous GA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F65614\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65614 \">picture 4</a>). The skin overlying the nodules appears normal. Lesions of subcutaneous GA are usually less than 4 cm in size and are most commonly located on the anterior lower legs, hands, head, and buttocks of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35143218\"><span class=\"h2\">Perforating GA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perforating GA is a variant of GA in which damaged collagen from the dermis is extruded onto the skin surface. This variant, which is most commonly seen in children and young adults, is characterized by asymptomatic erythematous papules that evolve into yellowish umbilicated papules that discharge clear or white fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Some lesions may resemble pustules. Perforating GA may be localized (usually on the extremities) or widespread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Pruritus or pain is present in a minority of patients. Lesions heal with scarring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19689471\"><span class=\"h2\">Patch GA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with the patch type of GA present with annular or nonannular, nonscaly patches that may be localized or generalized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F75365\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75365 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/4,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,31,32</a>]. Lesions commonly involve the proximal extremities. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H67047128\"><span class=\"h2\">Other variants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the established variants, GA has been reported to occur in a linear pattern and as uncharacteristically painful papules and plaques on acral skin. </p><p>Linear presentations of GA have been documented in a few patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F65976\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65976 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. In one of these cases, the lesion appeared following venectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>Acute, painful, erythematous papules or plaques on the hands and feet with histopathologic findings consistent with GA were reported in four patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Arthralgias accompanied symptoms in two of the patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19690202\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED DISORDERS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19690225\"><span class=\"h2\">Diabetes mellitus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data conflict on whether there is an association between diabetes mellitus and GA. In general, studies investigating this link have been of poor design and have been compromised by methodological flaws.</p><p>One retrospective study of 557 patients with GA found a higher incidence of insulin-dependent diabetes than expected when compared to data from an age-matched population (16 actual verus 0.9 expected cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. All but one patient with diabetes in this study had localized GA. In contrast, another retrospective study reported a higher incidence of diabetes (type unspecified) among 100 patients with generalized GA than among 1350 patients with localized GA (21 versus 10 percent had diabetes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A third retrospective study of 84 patients suggested that diabetes may influence disease course in GA; patients with diabetes (n = 10) appeared to have more chronic, relapsing courses of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>An association between diabetes and GA was refuted by the authors of a case-control study that compared 50 patients with GA (type unspecified) to 50 patients with psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. No significant difference in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was noted between the two groups. Of note, more recent evidence linking psoriasis to metabolic syndrome raises questions about whether psoriasis patients were an appropriate control population for this study. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis#H896745\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comorbid disease in psoriasis&quot;, section on 'Metabolic syndrome'</a>.) </p><p>A prospective study of 23 patients that assessed HgbA1C levels in 23 patients with GA (13 localized, 10 generalized) also did not support an association between these disorders; normal HgbA1C levels were detected in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Thus, the relationship between diabetes and GA remains uncertain. Future well-designed studies are necessary to explore this issue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19690232\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is uncertain whether GA portends an increased risk for malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. A review of 16 case reports and two retrospective studies published between 1966 and 2001 was unable to identify a definitive relationship between malignancy and GA, but noted that cases linked to malignancy typically occurred in patients with an atypical presentation of GA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Lymphoma was the most common association, accounting for approximately 50 percent of malignancies. Cancers were diagnosed between 18 months before and 42 months after a diagnosis of GA. Based upon these findings, the authors suggested evaluating older adults with atypical clinical presentations of GA for underlying malignancy. </p><p>Complicating the interpretation of the literature is the concern that some cases of GA that have been associated with malignancy may have been cases of interstitial granulomatous dermatitis (IGD) that were misdiagnosed. IGD can clinically and histologically resemble GA and has been associated with the development of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neutrophilic-dermatoses#H33\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neutrophilic dermatoses&quot;, section on 'Palisaded neutrophilic granulomatous dermatitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H622572\"><span class=\"h2\">Dyslipidemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GA may be associated with dyslipidemia. In a case-control study of 140 adults with idiopathic GA and 420 controls, dyslipidemia was significantly more prevalent among adults with GA (79 versus 52 percent; adjusted odds ratio 4.04, 95% CI 2.53-6.46) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The highest rates of dyslipidemia were seen with generalized GA (all of 23 patients) and GA with annular lesions (65 of 76 patients [86 percent]).</p><p>The rationale for an association between GA and dyslipidemia is unclear. Theories on the mechanism of the association include the possibility of an effect of chronic inflammation related to GA on the development of lipid abnormalities and the possibility that microvascular inflammation and dysfunction due to dyslipidemia contributes to GA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Additional studies on the relationship between GA and dyslipidemia are needed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H636707\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several case reports have linked GA to thyroid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>]. There have also been multiple reports of GA in the setting of HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/49-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-52</a>]. In a series of 34 patients with both HIV and GA, the generalized variant of GA was most common, occurring in approximately 60 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35143232\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, degeneration of collagen, and mucin deposition are characteristic histopathologic features of GA; these findings often present in an interstitial or palisaded pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/23,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,53,54</a>]. The interstitial pattern occurs in approximately 70 percent of cases, while a palisading pattern is seen in about 25 percent of biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Mucin deposition can be highlighted with alcian blue or colloidal iron stains.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The interstitial pattern is characterized by histiocytes embedded in basophilic mucin infiltrating between collagen bundles in the mid to upper dermis. Incomplete degeneration of collagen fibers is present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F67442\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67442 \">picture 7</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The palisading pattern is characterized by lymphohistiocytic inflammatory infiltrates that palisade around foci of collagen and elastin degeneration in the mid to upper dermis. Areas of collagen degeneration appear as eosinophilic fibrillar material separated by basophilic mucin deposits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F74645%7EDERM%2F76130%7EDERM%2F54717\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74645 graphicRef76130 graphicRef54717 \">picture 8A-C</a>)<strong>. </strong>Eosinophils may also be present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rarely, epithelioid histiocytic nodules resembling findings in sarcoidosis can be seen in GA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-manifestations-of-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous manifestations of sarcoidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Both the interstitial and palisading patterns can occur in localized and generalized GA. The interstitial pattern typically is associated with patch type GA; subcutaneous GA frequently presents with large histiocytic palisades surrounding degenerated collagen and mucin in the connective tissue septae within the subcutis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Perforating GA shows transepidermal elimination of mucinous, degenerating collagen fibers surrounded by palisading lymphohistiocytic granulomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F56210\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56210 \">picture 9</a>)<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum and rheumatoid nodules can present with histopathologic features similar to the palisading necrobiotic granulomas of GA. Histopathologic features that can assist with distinguishing these disorders from GA include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum </strong>&ndash; Broad areas of necrobiosis that sometimes extend into the subcutis are present within the superficial and deep dermis.

Sharp, irregular areas of necrobiosis are present within the subcutis and deep reticular dermis. Acute or chronic endoarteritis adjacent to the necrobiotic foci is evident in some cases. Unlike GA, mucin is usually absent.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35143239\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recognition of the classic clinical features of localized GA is usually sufficient for diagnosis; the presence of an asymptomatic, nonscaly, erythematous, annular or arcuate plaque with peripheral papules and central clearing is characteristic of localized GA. A biopsy is useful for atypical presentations or when the diagnosis is in question. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation or fungal culture should be performed when the differential diagnosis includes a dermatophyte infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-based-dermatologic-diagnostic-procedures#H4044416\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office-based dermatologic diagnostic procedures&quot;, section on 'Potassium hydroxide preparation'</a>.)</p><p>The widespread nature and variable lesion morphology in generalized GA contributes to the need for a punch biopsy to confirm the diagnosis in most cases. </p><p>The lack of overlying cutaneous changes can make a clinical diagnosis of subcutaneous GA difficult; an excisional biopsy should be performed when the diagnosis is in question.</p><p>No serologic tests are useful for the diagnosis of GA. Although further study is needed to confirm the findings of the case-control study that found an association between GA and dyslipidemia in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], due to the risks associated with dyslipidemia, we typically obtain a lipid profile in adults who present with GA. Laboratory studies to evaluate for the presence of other associated diseases is unnecessary for most patients. Patients with GA should be asked about signs or symptoms of diabetes mellitus, and if present, screening tests should be performed. Patients with GA who have risk factors or symptoms suggestive of HIV infection should be tested for this infection. Routine testing for other infectious disorders usually is not indicated, except as suggested by patient symptoms or signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/granuloma-annulare/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>].

The statistical significance of these results was not assessed in the study.</p><p>The discomfort associated with intralesional injection may be a deterrent to this therapy in children and some adults. For patients who prefer to avoid intralesional treatment, we typically prescribe a superpotent topical corticosteroid such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> 0.05% cream or spray (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>).

The cause of GA is unknown. (See <a href=\"#H35143167\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H35143174\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GA may present with a variety of clinical findings. The most common types of GA are the localized and generalized forms. Additional variants of GA include subcutaneous, perforating, and patch GA. (See <a href=\"#H35143181\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localized GA classically presents as a nonscaly, annular or arcuate inflammatory plaque on a distal extremity. Generalized GA presents with widely distributed papules and plaques on the trunk and extremities. Pruritus may accompany generalized GA. (See <a href=\"#H35143190\" class=\"local\">'Localized GA'</a> above and <a href=\"#H35143197\" class=\"local\">'Generalized GA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relationships between GA and diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and internal malignancy are not well understood. Additional studies are necessary to determine whether there is a link between GA and these disorders. (See <a href=\"#H19690202\" class=\"local\">'Associated disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical examination often is sufficient for the diagnosis of localized GA. Unlike tinea corporis, scale is always absent. Skin biopsies assist with distinguishing the other variants of GA from skin disorders with similar clinical features. No serologic tests are useful to confirm the diagnosis of GA. (See <a href=\"#H35143239\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because it is unknown whether there is a relationship between diabetes and GA, patients who present with GA should be asked about signs and symptoms of diabetes. Routine screening for diabetes in all patients is not necessary. The possibility of malignancy should be investigated in older adults who present with atypical presentations of GA. (See <a href=\"#H35143239\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with localized GA who desire treatment, we suggest treatment with topical or intralesional corticosteroids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients should be followed closely for the development of cutaneous adverse effects. Other treatment options include cryotherapy, phototherapy, and topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>. (See <a href=\"#H35143253\" class=\"local\">'Localized GA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with generalized GA who desire treatment, we suggest topical calcineurin inhibitors, UVA1, or psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) as first-line treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Topical corticosteroids can be useful for treating select lesions in generalized GA. Limited data suggest that systemic treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> may be beneficial for generalized GA. (See <a href=\"#H35143260\" class=\"local\">'Generalized GA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients with GA experience spontaneous resolution of disease within a few years.
