Despite improvements in therapy, the mortality rate in patients with HF has remained unacceptably high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], making early detection of susceptible persons who would benefit from preventive measures imperative.</p><p>The epidemiology and causes of HF will be reviewed here. Diastolic dysfunction, asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, and causes of HF decompensation are discussed separately.

Part of the problem is that large differences exist among studies in their definition of the condition and the methods used to establish its presence. In addition, presymptomatic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is now used increasingly as an indicator of impending, if not existing, HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At least six HF scoring methodologies based upon symptoms and signs have been developed to assess the presence of HF. Clinical diagnostic criteria for HF have generally included history, physical examination, and chest radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. A 2013 update from the American Heart Association (AHA) estimated that there were 5.1 million people with HF in the United States in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. There are an estimated 23 million people with HF worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Regardless of the definition used, the prevalence of HF and LV dysfunction increases steeply with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/1,9-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9-14</a>]. As an example, the Framingham Heart Study found a prevalence of HF in men of 8 per 1000 at age 50 to 59 years, increasing to 66 per 1000 at ages 80 to 89 years; similar values (8 and 79 per 1000) were noted in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The prevalence in African-Americans is reported to be 25 percent higher than in whites.</p><p>The Framingham Study estimates are primarily based upon symptomatic HF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55866\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55866 \">table 1</a>). These figures do not include asymptomatic patients with a reduced LV ejection fraction (LVEF). Investigations using echocardiography have found that only 50 percent of participants with LV dysfunction are symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a community survey from the Mayo Clinic, of 123 patients with an LVEF &le;50 percent, 30 (24 percent) had a diagnosis of HF; of 40 patients with an LVEF &le;40 percent, 21 (53 percent) had a diagnosis of HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests to evaluate left ventricular systolic function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There has been an increase in the prevalence of HF in the population over time. In one study, the average increase from 1989 to 1999 was <span class=\"nowrap\">1/1000</span> and 0.<span class=\"nowrap\">9/1000</span> for women and men, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This has been associated with a three- to fourfold rise in the rate of hospitalization for HF from 1971 to 1999 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Several elements are contributing to this rise, particularly aging of the population. In addition, improved treatment of hypertension and valvular and coronary disease is allowing patients to survive an early death only to later develop HF. The prevalence of HF in the United States is projected to rise over the next four decades with an estimated 772,000 new HF cases projected in the year 2040 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>However, these trends must be interpreted with caution because of the introduction of new diagnostic methodology, changes in hospital admission and reimbursement practices, increased awareness of the problem, and changes in the prevalence of comorbidity. Coexistent disease is often the chief reason for hospitalization of HF patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In 2004, there were over one million hospitalizations in the United States with a first listed discharge diagnosis of HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In addition, at least 20 percent of hospital admissions among persons older than 65 are due to HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Data from the United Kingdom indicate a rising prevalence of HF (23 percent increase in prevalent cases between 2002 and 2014) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Preserved systolic function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is now appreciated that HF often occurs with normal LV systolic function (ie, presumably on the basis of diastolic dysfunction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Various studies estimate that as many as 40 to 60 percent of patients with HF have diastolic dysfunction as defined by a normal LVEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/9,10,23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,23-26</a>]. However, there has been a marked variability in the reported prevalence of HF with a preserved EF (ranging from 13 to 74 percent; HFpEF) due to the use of heterogeneous criteria and hospital-based data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The prevalence of HFpEF increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. In one review, the estimated prevalence of diastolic dysfunction among patients with HF was 15, 33, and 50 percent at ages less than 50, 50 to 70, and more than 70 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, another 15 percent of elderly patients with HF have mildly abnormal systolic function (LVEF 45 to 54 percent), which should not produce symptoms on its own and is therefore probably associated with an important component of diastolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In a study conducted in Olmsted County, Minnesota, 21 percent of the population had mild diastolic dysfunction, 7 percent had moderate diastolic dysfunction, 0.7 percent had severe diastolic dysfunction, and 5.6 percent had moderate or severe diastolic dysfunction with a normal LVEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Data from Olmsted County also indicate that the proportion of patients with HF with preserved systolic function may have increased in the community over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of HF, like the prevalence, increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/14,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,31</a>]. In the Framingham Study, the incidence approximately doubled over each successive decade of life, rising more steeply with age in women than in men (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79137\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79137 \">table 2</a>). The annual incidence in men rose from 2 per 1000 at age 35 to 64 years to 12 per 1000 at age 65 to 94 years. Because the increase in risk with age is balanced by the decreased life expectancy with older age, the lifetime likelihood of developing HF is approximately 20 percent at all ages above 40 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Data from the United Kingdom indicate a decrease in age-standardized HF incidence between 2002 and 2014 by 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H537319905\"><span class=\"h3\">Relative incidence of HFrEF and HFpEF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HF may occur with either a preserved or a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF or HFrEF).

A few patients with LVEF between 40 and 50 percent were excluded from the analysis. Among 8592 subjects, 4.4 percent were diagnosed with HF during a median of 11.5 years.

Among women, there was a decline in age-adjusted incidence of HF in women between the time periods of 1950 to 1969 and 1970 to 1979 and no subsequent change in the period of 1990 to 1999.

In a retrospective study of 622,789 Medicare beneficiaries &ge;65 years old diagnosed with HF between 1994 and 2003, the incidence of HF declined from 32 per 1000 person-years in 1994 to 29 per 1000 person-years in 2003. Incidence declined most sharply among beneficiaries aged 80 to 84 years old (from 57.5 to 48.4 per 1000 person-years) and increased slightly among beneficiaries aged 65 to 69 years (from 17.5 to 19.3 per 1000 person-years).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Younger adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fewer data are available on the incidence of HF in younger adults.

A report from the CARDIA study of 5115 subjects (52 percent black; 48 percent white) aged 18 to 30 years who were prospectively followed for 20 years found that incident HF before 50 years of age is substantially more common among blacks than whites (1.1, 0.9, 0.08, and 0 percent in black women, black men, white women, and white men, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

At age 40, the lifetime risk of HF occurring without antecedent myocardial infarction (MI) was one in nine for men and one in six for women.

A report noted that the lifetime risk of HF varied by age and HF type. Thus, the lifetime risk of all HF and of HFpEF is higher in whites compared with blacks, whereas lifetime risk of HFrEF was similar in whites and blacks. Likewise, lifetime risk of HFrEF is higher in men, but that of HFpEF is similar in the two sexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

However, coronary disease and diabetes mellitus have become increasingly responsible for HF while hypertension and valve disease have become less common because of improvements in detection and therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. Over four decades of observation in the Framingham Study, the prevalence of coronary disease as a cause of HF increased 41 percent per calendar decade in men and 25 percent in women; the prevalence of diabetes as a contributing cause increased by more than 20 percent per decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-causes-of-heart-failure/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Clinical trials suggest a higher prevalence (60 to 65 percent) of coronary disease.
