Even if improved delivery of oxygen to the fetal tissues is beneficial in some cases, the underlying causes of fetal hypoxemia need to be addressed, as fetal acidemia will not be corrected by maternal oxygen administration alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intrapartum-category-i-ii-and-iii-fetal-heart-rate-tracings/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>An intravenous fluid bolus of non-glucose crystalloid can improve placental blood flow and fetal oxygenation if the patient is hypovolemic from prolonged lack of oral or intravenous intake, vomiting, or sympathetic blockade, and thus may improve fetal oxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intrapartum-category-i-ii-and-iii-fetal-heart-rate-tracings/abstract/33,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,42</a>].

Since uterine activity causes intermittent interruption of blood flow to the intervillous space, excessive uterine activity that exceeds the critical level for an individual fetus will result in fetal hypoxemia. If there is no prompt response to these measures, we suggest administering a tocolytic drug, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbutaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbutaline</a> 250 mcg subcutaneously, as uterine relaxation may improve placental blood flow and&nbsp;fetal&nbsp;oxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intrapartum-category-i-ii-and-iii-fetal-heart-rate-tracings/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Intermittent variable decelerations (associated with &lt;50 percent of contractions) are frequently observed intrapartum and usually associated with moderate variability <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> accelerations. They do not typically result in adverse consequences, presumably because transient cord compression is well tolerated by the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intrapartum-category-i-ii-and-iii-fetal-heart-rate-tracings/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

In a 2012 meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing amnioinfusion to no amnioinfusion in women with potential cord compression because of oligohydramnios or suspected cord compression because of variable FHR decelerations, amnioinfusion was associated with a 50 to 60 percent reduction in FHR abnormalities compared to controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intrapartum-category-i-ii-and-iii-fetal-heart-rate-tracings/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

Patients with low pre-amnioinfusion amniotic fluid volume are most likely to experience resolution of variable decelerations; in patients with a high amniotic fluid volume (amniotic fluid index &gt;12 cm) and variable heart rate decelerations, a nuchal cord or umbilical cord knot is a more likely cause of the variable pattern than reduced amniotic fluid so amnioinfusion is less likely to be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-intrapartum-category-i-ii-and-iii-fetal-heart-rate-tracings/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].
