This is most often a problem for people who work in hospitals or other health care settings. The most serious infections to be aware of include HIV and hepatitis B and C.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568874\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if I have been &quot;exposed&quot; in a way that could infect me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contact with blood, tissue, or other body fluids from an infected person can be risky if it involves:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A needlestick or a sharp object that breaks your skin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contact with the pink, moist tissues called &quot;mucous membranes&quot; that line your mouth, nose, eyes, and other body parts</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contact with parts of your skin that have cuts or scrapes that are still bleeding</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contact with concentrated forms of a virus, such as you would find in a research lab</p><p/><p>Not all body fluids are equally dangerous. In general, blood has more viruses than other body fluids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568881\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I got blood or other fluids on my skin?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Healthy skin is actually very good at protecting you from infection. Even so, if you get blood or body fluids on your skin, you should wash the area that was exposed with soap and water. If you have any cuts or scrapes on your skin, you should also use alcohol or another disinfectant on those parts of your skin after you're done washing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568888\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I got blood or other fluids in my mouth, nose, or eyes?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you got blood or body fluids in your mouth or nose, you should rinse with lots and lots of water. If you got blood or body fluids in your eyes, you should rinse with water or a saltwater solution called &quot;saline.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568895\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I was stuck by a needle?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your exposure involved something that broke the skin, such as a needle, you should wash with soap and water and use a disinfectant. But you should not squeeze or pinch the area to try to get anything out. This goes for a needlestick or for a cut with a surgical tool.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568902\"><span class=\"h1\">Who should I talk to?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any time you are exposed to blood or body fluids at work, you should talk to your boss or someone in the human resources &quot;occupational health department&quot; of your job. You might need to fill out a report, and you will probably need to see a doctor.</p><p>If you cannot speak to someone at work right away, or if this happened outside of work, call your own doctor right away. It is very important to see a doctor as soon as possible after an exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568909\"><span class=\"h1\">What will the doctor do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The doctor will test your own blood to see if you already have any infections that you were not aware of before. He or she will also get as many details as possible about the type of exposure you had. For example, if you had a needlestick, the doctor will ask you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you know the size of the needle</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you bled after the needlestick</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you could see blood in the needle or syringe before it stuck you</p><p/><p>The doctor will also try to identify the patient whose blood or fluids you were exposed to. That way, the doctor can try to find out if the patient has any known infections, such as HIV. If the patient has never been tested for HIV or hepatitis, the patient will be asked if he or she is willing to be tested. Testing the patient can help the doctor figure out which treatments you might need. For example, if a test shows that the patient does not have HIV, then you do not need any preventive treatment for HIV.</p><p>The doctor will also explain how likely it is that you could get infected, based on the type of exposure you had. For example, a needlestick from a needle that was used on a person with hepatitis C would be much more concerning than a splash of urine on your skin from the same person.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568916\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are pregnant or there is any chance that you could be pregnant, make sure you tell the doctor. If you are pregnant, your exposure might need to be handled differently than it would be otherwise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568923\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I might have been exposed to HIV?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you were definitely or possibly exposed to HIV, the doctor can give you the option of taking medicines to reduce the chance that you will get infected with HIV. These are the same medicines that are used to treat HIV. If you decide to take these medicines, you will need to start them as soon as possible and take them for a month. You will probably have to take 2 to 3 different pills. Talk to the doctor about the risks and benefits of these medicines for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568930\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I might have been exposed to hepatitis B?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you were definitely or possibly exposed to hepatitis B, the doctor will want to know if and when you had the hepatitis B vaccine. The treatment you need will depend on whether you had the vaccine and how well the vaccine worked for you. If you were tested in the past and your doctor knows that the vaccine worked, nothing else needs to be done.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you do not know how well the vaccine worked for you, the doctor might run a blood test to find out how well your body responded. Sometimes, the doctor might choose to give you another dose of the vaccine before the blood test comes back. However, if your blood tests show good protection, you will not need any other treatment to prevent hepatitis B.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you got the hepatitis B vaccine in the past, but you do not have good protection, you will need to get the vaccine again. Sometimes the levels of protection can go down over time. But a simple booster shot can bring protection back up. You might also need a shot of a medicine called &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-immune-globulin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hepatitis B immune globulin</a>.&quot; This medicine can help prevent hepatitis B infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you never got the hepatitis B vaccine, now is a good time to get it. It can still protect you from infection, even after exposure. You might also need a medicine called &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-immune-globulin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hepatitis B immune globulin</a>.&quot; This will help protect you until the vaccine starts to work. Plus, you should get any other vaccine you might be missing, such as a tetanus vaccine. This way you will be fully protected in the future.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568937\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I might have been exposed to hepatitis C?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you were definitely or possibly exposed to hepatitis C, it's important to see the doctor to find out more about your risk. There is no vaccine or medicine to prevent hepatitis C infection. But the doctor can help you by watching you closely for the first signs of infection. If you become infected with hepatitis C, there is a good chance your body will fight off the infection on its own. But if not, treatment with certain medicines can cure most hepatitis C infections when they are new.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568944\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens in the weeks after a blood or body fluid exposure?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The doctor will test you again to see if you got the infection or infections he or she is worried about. These tests will be done at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after exposure. If it turns out you did get any of these infections, there are treatments you can get.</p><p>In the weeks after your exposure, look for symptoms of HIV infection, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swollen glands</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sore throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sores in your mouth, penis, anus, or vagina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle and joint pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p/><p>Also look for symptoms of hepatitis, which include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain on the right side</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of appetite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eyes turning yellow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea</p><p/><p>If you notice any symptoms that worry you, call the doctor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1569131\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventing-hiv-after-unprotected-sex-or-needle-sharing-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preventing HIV after unprotected sex or needle-sharing (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-aids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: HIV/AIDS (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hepatitis B (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hepatitis C (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-for-hepatitis-c-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Treatment for hepatitis C (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hepatitis B (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hepatitis C (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=testing-for-hiv-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Testing for HIV (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=symptoms-of-hiv-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Symptoms of HIV infection (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
