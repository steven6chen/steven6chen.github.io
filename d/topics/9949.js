In some of these disorders, there is also the apparent accumulation of fat in other regions of the body.</p><p>The extent of fat loss correlates with the severity of the metabolic abnormalities. Clinically, patients with severe lipodystrophy have severe insulin resistance and a group of unique features, such as severe hyperlipidemia, progressive liver disease, and increased metabolic rate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F79962\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79962 \">table 1</a>). Acquired and congenital lipodystrophies may also be associated with proteinuric kidney diseases, and renal biopsy of patients with nephrotic range proteinuria has revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>There is increasing understanding of the molecular basis for these disorders, but it is likely that multiple molecular defects are responsible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F94341\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94341 \">figure 1</a>). A widely accepted classification of the various types of lipodystrophies is presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F71384\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71384 \">table 2</a>). Other disorders that need to be differentiated from lipodystrophies are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66232\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66232 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>The current most prevalent form, by far, of lipodystrophy is in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and is likely related to antiretroviral therapy. HIV-related lipodystrophy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hiv-associated-lipodystrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of HIV-associated lipodystrophy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERALIZED LIPODYSTROPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These are rare but clinically striking disorders that may be congenital (Seip-Berardinelli syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>] or acquired (Lawrence syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Their prevalence has been estimated to be less than one case per one million people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital generalized lipodystrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, with frequent parental consanguinity. At least four molecularly distinct forms of congenital lipodystrophy have been defined, with the mutations of <em>AGPAT2</em> and <em>BSCL2</em> being responsible for 95 percent of reported cases of CGLs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F94341\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94341 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1156185556\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormal appearance due to the absence of subcutaneous fat is noted within the first two years of life, often at or soon after birth. Adipose tissue is almost completely absent from most subcutaneous areas, the abdomen, the thorax, and bone marrow, whereas normal amounts of adipose tissue are present in the orbits, mouth and tongue, palms and soles, scalp, perineum, and periarticular regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>During childhood these patients have a voracious appetite, accelerated linear growth, increased metabolic rate, and advanced bone age. The final height is usually normal. Other abnormalities are acanthosis nigricans and protuberant abdomen due to hepatomegaly caused by fatty infiltration of the liver, which can lead to cirrhosis and its complications. Prominent musculature and precocious secondary sexual development may also occur, and some patients have intellectual impairment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78980\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78980 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Among the molecularly distinct forms of CGL, the clinical phenotype varies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 1 CGL (CGL1) is due to <em>AGPAT2</em> gene mutations. This gene has been mapped to chromosomes 9q34. It encodes the enzyme acyltransferase 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 2 (AGPAT2), which catalyzes the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid to form phosphatidic acid, a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of triglycerides and glycerophospholipids. <em>AGPAT2</em> mutations are found predominantly in patients of African ancestry. Individuals have normal intelligence, and their mechanical fat is preserved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 2 CGL (CGL2) is due to <em>BSCL2</em> gene mutations. This gene is located in chromosome 11q13 and encodes a 398-amino-acid protein called seipin. The <em>BSCL2</em> gene mutation has been found in patients of European and Middle Eastern origins but has also been reported as a causative gene in Japanese with CGL. <em>BSCL2</em> expression is critical for normal adipogenesis in vitro, as cells lacking <em>BSCL2</em> failed to induce expression of key lipogenic transcription factors, including peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARG), <span class=\"nowrap\">CCAAT/enhancer</span> binging protein-alpha <span class=\"nowrap\">(C/EBP-alpha),</span> as well as enzymes AGPAT2, DGAT2, and lipin 1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">CGL2 due to seipin mutation appears to manifest itself as a more severe disease phenotype than that due to <em>AGPAT2</em> mutation (CGL1), with a higher incidence of premature death and a lower prevalence of partial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delayed onset of lipodystrophy. In addition, compared with CGL1, CGL2 patients have more pronounced absence of body fat, loss of metabolically active fat (subcutaneous regions, intermuscular regions, bone marrow, intraabdominal and intrathoracic regions), and lack of mechanical fat (orbital regions, palms, soles, and joints). Patients with CGL2 also have a higher prevalence of intellectual impairment and cardiomyopathy than those with CGL1.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 3 CGL (CGL3) is due to a homozygous nonsense mutation of <em>CAV1</em>, probably as a result of a consanguineous union. <em>CAV1</em> is located on chromosome 7q31 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Its end product, caveolin-1, is a highly conserved 22-KDa protein and a major fatty acid binder on the plasma membranes as well as a crucial component of plasma membrane microdomains known as caveolae. These plasma membrane domains have important roles in regulating signaling pathways and processes such as cell migration, polarization, and proliferation. Mutated function of <em>CAV1</em> may lead to lipodystrophy by interfering with lipid handling, lipid droplet formation, and adipocyte differentiation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with <em>CAV1</em> mutations reportedly have clinical features similar to those of patients with CGL1 and CGL2, with the degree of lipodystrophy being intermediate between these two phenotypes. Individuals have normal intelligence, and their mechanical fat is preserved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 4 CGL (CGL4) is due to mutations in the <em>PTRF</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. <em>PTRF</em>, also known as cavin, is a polymerase I and transcript release factor involved in biogenesis of caveolae, regulating caveolin 1 and 3 expression. To date, 21 patients with <em>PTRF</em> mutations have been reported in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Clinical features include moderate lipodystrophy in association with congenital myopathy, esophageal dysfunction, pyloric stenosis, atlantoaxial instability, QT interval prolongation with exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death.</p><p/><p>Of note, there are several patients with CGL who do not have any of the four known gene mutations, possibly leading to future identification of novel CGL genes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Metabolic abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insulin resistance has been noted at an early age. Diabetes mellitus usually develops in the early teens, but ketosis is rare, and the diabetes is usually refractory to insulin therapy. Hypertriglyceridemia with high serum concentrations of both very low-density lipoprotein and chylomicrons is common, may cause acute pancreatitis, and is related to the fatty liver. Serum leptin concentrations are low, consistent with near total absence of body fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Acquired generalized lipodystrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The characteristics of acquired generalized lipodystrophy are similar to those of the congenital disorder, except that the former develops in a previously healthy child or adult over a period of days to weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Only a few dozen cases have been reported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A previous infection has been causally linked to this syndrome because histologic analysis of subcutaneous tissue reveals panniculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Antibodies against adipocyte-membrane antigens have been detected in a few patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and the syndrome may coexist with other autoimmune diseases, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, hemolytic anemia, and chronic active hepatitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The syndrome can, as noted above, occur in children or adults, and females predominate. In most patients, the loss of fat begins in adolescence and occurs over a period of weeks, months, or years. Superficial veins and musculature are prominent, and hepatomegaly is a consistent finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Other findings include mild hirsutism, acanthosis nigricans, muscle hypertrophy, and cirrhosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F75295\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75295 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Adipose tissue distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is generalized loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Metabolic abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients have severe insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, low serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations, and often a high metabolic rate. Diabetes, high serum free fatty acid concentrations, and excessive lipolysis are present. Most patients do not become ketotic, but diabetic ketoacidosis has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-resistance-definition-and-clinical-spectrum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulin resistance: Definition and clinical spectrum&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CONGENITAL PARTIAL LIPODYSTROPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several distinct syndromes of regional lipoatrophy are associated with a simultaneous hypertrophy of adipose tissue in nonatrophic areas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Familial partial lipodystrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD) syndromes are rare syndromes characterized by variable loss of adipose tissue that occurs during childhood, puberty, or young adulthood. They are associated with metabolic complications and, in some cases, cardiomyopathy, conduction disturbances, and congestive heart failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">FPLD type 1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FPLD type 1 (Kobberling lipodystrophy) is characterized by loss of adipose tissue in the extremities and normal adipose tissue elsewhere. Affected individuals may have excessive amounts of subcutaneous truncal fat. Only a few affected women have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>The age of onset, mode of inheritance, and characteristic features are not well defined, due to the small number of cases described. Lipodystrophy and remarkable well-defined muscles are the most frequently described clinical characteristics. Most reported patients have had hypertriglyceridemia and diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The genetic defect associated with Kobberling-type lipodystrophy is currently unknown, and no <em>LMNA </em>or <em>PPARG </em>mutations have been identified. Although it appears that this syndrome is familial, it may also occur spontaneously.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">FPLD type 2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FPLD type 2 (Dunnigan lipodystrophy) is associated with fat loss from the extremities, abdomen, and thorax and excess subcutaneous fat in the chin and supraclavicular area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/1,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,24-26</a>].</p><p>The patients have normal adipose tissue in childhood but lose subcutaneous adipose tissue from the extremities later, usually with the onset of puberty. The syndrome is associated with increased muscularity, not merely the appearance of increased muscularity that occurs with loss of subcutaneous fat, which makes it relatively easier to recognize in women. Muscle biopsies from individuals with the syndrome reveal hypertrophy of type 1 and 2 muscle fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Patients may develop excess supraclavicular fat and round facies later in life. They also may have acanthosis nigricans, hirsutism, and menstrual abnormalities (ovarian hyperandrogenism) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F60538\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60538 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>Diabetes may develop after the age of 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] and is accompanied by hypertriglyceridemia (hyperchylomicronemia), low serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations, and high fasting serum free fatty acid concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], leading to increased cardiovascular risk.</p><p>Although this disorder was thought to be transmitted as an X-linked dominant trait, there is autosomal dominant transmission in some families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/28,30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30-33</a>]. The locus for the autosomal dominant form is located on chromosome 1q21-22 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The mutations appear to involve the <em>LMNA</em> gene, which encodes nuclear lamins A and C, nuclear envelope proteins that organize nuclear architecture through structural attachments that vary during the cell cycle and cell differentiation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F94341\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94341 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A less severe phenotype has been described in two sisters whose mutation involved lamin A only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Most mutations in <em>LMNA</em> are missense mutations within the 3' end of the gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The mutant gene products may disrupt interaction with chromatin or other nuclear lamina proteins, resulting in apoptosis and premature death of adipocytes. The accumulation of prelamin A may also impair adipogenesis by interfering with the key adipocyte transcription <span class=\"nowrap\">factors/regulators,</span> including sterol response element binding proteins 1 (SREBP 1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">FPLD type 3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FPLD type 3 is associated with heterozygous <em>PPARG</em> gene mutations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F94341\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94341 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Heterozygous mutations may cause loss of function by directly interfering with normal gene function (dominant negative) or by reduction of gene expression (haploinsufficiency). The phenotype is similar to Dunnigan's variety, with the exception that fat accumulation in the head and neck may be spared. Patients with FPLD3 appear to have more severe metabolic abnormalities than those with FPLD2.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">FPLD type 4</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FPLD type 4 is associated with a mutation in the <em>PLIN1</em> gene coding for perilipin 1, which is a required component of lipid droplet membranes and is essential for lipolysis and lipid storage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. It is characterized phenotypically by loss of subcutaneous fat from the extremities. Histologically, the six patients with this mutation have small adipocytes with increased macrophage infiltration and abundant fibrosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20371223\"><span class=\"h3\">FPLD type 5</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FPLD type 5 is due to an autosomal recessive mutation in the <em>CIDEC</em> gene. The <em>CIDEC </em>gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p25.3) and encodes for the CIDEC protein. <em>CIDEC </em>is expressed in the lipid droplets, and mutation(s) of the <em>CIDEC </em>gene result in low levels of functional CIDEC protein, leading to lack of ability of lipid droplets to store fat. Reported symptoms include partial lipodystrophy, severe insulin resistance, fatty liver, acanthosis nigricans, and diabetes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2587103807\"><span class=\"h3\">FPLD type 6</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FPLD type 6 is due to a mutation in the <em>LIPE</em>&nbsp;(lipase E, hormone sensitive type) gene. This form of lipodystrophy is characterized by abnormal subcutaneous fat distribution. Affected individuals may have increased visceral fat, impaired lipolysis, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, systemic insulin resistance, and diabetes. Some patients manifest muscular dystrophy and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53981171\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FPLD can also be due to a mutation of <em>AKT2</em> (protein kinase B), a <span class=\"nowrap\">serine/threonine-protein</span> kinase that plays multiple roles in cell signaling, cell growth, and glycogen synthesis as well as insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Lipodystrophy in patients with <em>AKT2</em> mutations is thought to be due to reduced adipocyte differentiation and dysfunctional post-receptor insulin signaling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20371206\"><span class=\"h2\">Partial lipodystrophy due to CAV1 mutation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A mutation in <em>CAV1</em> was identified as a rare cause of partial lipodystrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Two cases with different frameshift <em>CAV1</em> mutations have been reported to have partial lipodystrophy with subcutaneous fat loss in the face and upper body, micrognathia, and congenital cataracts. One case was also associated with abnormal neurologic findings. Diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and recurrent pancreatitis were reported in both cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Mandibuloacral dysplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mandibuloacral dysplasia (MAD) is an extremely rare, autosomal recessive, premature aging (progeroid) syndrome, which has been reported in approximately 40 case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. There are two distinctive phenotypes. Type A is considered to be due to mutations of the <em>LMNA</em> gene and involves the loss of subcutaneous fat from the arms and legs but normal or excessive deposition of fat in the face and neck. Type B is characterized by more generalized loss of subcutaneous fat.</p><p>These patients carry compound heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding an endoprotease, zinc metalloprotease (<em>ZMPSTE24</em>), on chromosome 1q34 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. The enzyme is important in posttranslational processing of prelamin A to mature lamin A.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lipoatrophy is first noted in childhood or early adolescence and is more marked in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In addition to lipodystrophy, this disorder is characterized by postnatal growth retardation, craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities (mandibular and clavicular hypoplasia, delayed closure of the cranial sutures, acro-osteolysis, joint contractures, bird-like face, dental abnormalities), and cutaneous changes (restrictive dermatopathy, skin atrophy, alopecia, and mottled cutaneous pigmentation). Dysmorphic manifestations and progeroid features become more prominent with time, and the full clinical phenotype is recognizable during the early school years. The patients have normal intelligence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9679956\"><span class=\"h3\">Metabolic abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia have been reported in some patients. Serum leptin concentration can be low or normal. In one study, individuals with pathogenic variants of the <em>PPARG</em> gene had less prominent fat loss and relatively higher levels of leptin than those with pathogenic variants of the <em>LMNA</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis has been reported in patients with <em>ZMPSTE24</em> deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20371256\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoinflammatory syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>JMP (joint contractures, muscle atrophy, microcytic anemia, and panniculitis-induced lipodystrophy) syndrome of childhood is a rare, autosomal recessive, autoinflammatory syndrome that has been reported in three individual patients from Japan and two families from Mexico and Portugal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Clinical features include hepatosplenomegaly, intermittent fever, calcification of the basal ganglia, and hypergammaglobulinemia. Sequencing of candidate genes demonstrated a loss-of-function mutation of the proteasome subunit, beta-type, (<em>PSMB</em>)-8 gene on chromosome 6. <em>PSMB8</em> encodes b5i, a catalytic subunit of immunoproteasomes, which mediates proteolysis and generates major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class 1 molecules. Mutations may result in adipose tissue lymphocytic infiltrations and loss of surrounding fat tissue.</p><p>CANDLE (chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperature) is another described syndrome causing partial lipodystrophy, currently reported in six patients, and likely characterized by an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Infants present with annular violaceous plaques and recurrent fevers, with eventual loss of adipose tissue from the upper limbs and face. Associated clinical characteristics include hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, eyelid swelling, and calcifications of the basal ganglia. The molecular mechanism of this syndrome remains unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20371266\"><span class=\"h2\">Other syndromes with a component of lipodystrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple other syndromes are also linked to lipodystrophy.

Drug-induced lipodystrophy at the site of injection was a frequent complication of insulin therapy before the availability of purified human insulin but is rare now. Other medications, such as glucocorticoids and antibiotics, can also cause localized lipoatrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Other rare causes of localized lipoatrophy include repeated pressure against any body part and lipoatrophy occurring as part of a rare syndrome called lipodystrophia centrifugalis abdominalis infantilis. This is characterized by a centrifugal loss of adipose tissue in the abdomen with somewhat erythematous and scaly changes at the periphery, which usually occurs before the age of three years.

These mice have decreased expression of several molecules, including peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor gamma (PPARG), insulin receptors, insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2, and leptin, whereas expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha is increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. Thus, it has been proposed that possible mediators of insulin resistance in lipodystrophy include increased tumor necrosis factor, free fatty acids, or leptin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adiponectin deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>].</p><p>Transplantation of even small amounts of adipose tissue or leptin treatment in diabetic, insulin-resistant mice with lipodystrophy and low serum leptin concentrations results in improved glycemia and decreased serum insulin concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/53,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,57</a>]. In addition, replacing either adiponectin or leptin in an animal model of lipodystrophy, insulin resistance, and the metabolic syndrome improves insulin resistance, whereas replacing both adiponectin and leptin fully normalizes insulin resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lipodystrophic-syndromes/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].
