The following are some details concerning the causes of deconditioning and specific efforts to improve physical activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Androgen abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both male and female patients with CKD exhibit abnormalities in androgen production. With males, uremia also impairs gonadal steroidogenesis. The serum total and free testosterone concentrations are typically reduced, although the binding capacity and concentration of sex hormone-binding globulin are normal. Another manifestation of diminished testosterone secretory capacity is the subnormal and delayed testosterone response to the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin, a compound with luteinizing hormone-like actions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in uremic men&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reproductive-and-sexual-dysfunction-in-uremic-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reproductive and sexual dysfunction in uremic women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prior to the availability of recombinant erythropoietin, androgen therapy was successfully utilized to increase erythropoiesis in some hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This agent has now been reintroduced to help improve body composition and muscle strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In one study, 79 patients were randomly assigned in a 2x2 factorial fashion to anabolic steroid administration and resistance exercise training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Nandrolone administration increased lean body mass and quadriceps muscle size, while exercise increased muscle size alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As observed in a large number of studies, the correction of anemia with erythropoietin improves endurance, strength, and quality of life in patients with chronic renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In one study, for example, the correction of anemia with erythropoietin to a target hemoglobin of 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in 11 previously transfusion-dependent hemodialysis patients resulted in a 10 to 30 percent increase in arm and leg muscle strength in three months, although this improvement still left the patients significantly less strong than healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Muscle structure may also improve with erythropoietin treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-anemia-in-nondialysis-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of anemia in nondialysis chronic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyporesponse-to-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-esas-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyporesponse to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, correction of anemia with transfusion in nonuremic patients does not appear to improve muscle function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, the maintenance of an adequate hemoglobin with iron and erythropoietin failed to help exercise performance in predialysis patients with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These findings are likely due to the deleterious effects of decreasing kidney function on muscle strength and aerobic performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitamin D metabolism and secondary hyperparathyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deficiency of 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D(3), phosphate retention, and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) may also contribute to poor conditioning in patients with chronic renal failure. This is indirectly shown in vitamin D-dependent rickets, in which a significant clinical feature is muscle weakness; this can be corrected in part by supplementation with appropriate doses of vitamin D and calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-treatment-of-calcipenic-rickets-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and treatment of calcipenic rickets in children&quot;</a>).&nbsp;Calcitriol levels begin to decrease in stage 2 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/m<sup>2</sup>),</span> so this could affect millions of patients.</p><p>Although many patients with CKD receive active vitamin D analogs for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism, it is not clear whether vitamin D analog administration improves strength or endurance. One randomized, controlled trial examined the effects of cholecalciferol on muscle strength and functional capacity among hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Sixty individuals were randomly assigned to receive either oral cholecalciferol, 50,000 international units, or placebo weekly for eight weeks and then monthly for four months. At six months, there was no difference between groups in muscle strength, functional capacity, or health-related quality of life, despite higher values of 25(H)D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.</p><p>Whether CKD patients with adequate control of PTH and normal calcium and phosphate levels should receive some form of vitamin D supplementation for muscle function is unclear. However, there is a very high incidence of 25 hydroxyvitamin D(3) deficiency or insufficiency (&lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> in CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Improvement in the large number of musculoskeletal complaints after supplementation in the general population with vitamin D insufficiency suggests that this strategy may work in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Parathyroid receptors are also found in skeletal muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The effect of PTH on muscle function in the setting of secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal failure has also not been exhaustively studied. However, most investigators feel that extremely high PTH levels adversely affect muscle function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Support for this is provided by numerous reports claiming consistent improvement in muscle function after removal of parathyroid adenomas in primary hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The abnormal calcium and phosphorus metabolism in CKD also likely contributes to musculoskeletal dysfunction. Although placing patients in positive calcium balance has been implicated in vascular calcifications and increased mortality, negative calcium balance also has detrimental effects upon CKD patients. Extremely high phosphorus levels in dialysis patients have been implicated in spontaneous ruptures of tendons with exertion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Dialysis access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few studies have addressed the impact of the presence of a hemodialysis vascular access or a peritoneal dialysis catheter upon physical function. A forearm access, for example, likely affects the function of both large and fine motor skills in the affected arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although restrictions are often placed upon patients with various access (eg, swimming and heavy lifting with peritoneal catheters; lifting with the vascular access arm, heavy perspiration, or swimming with a hemodialysis catheter; etc), these recommendations are largely based on anecdotal practices. Most surgeons recommend hand isometric exercises after placement of a forearm fistula to improve development of the fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Dialysis-related L-carnitine disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of intravenous L-carnitine in hemodialysis patients remains controversial. The biochemical diagnosis of this disorder is difficult since nearly all dialysis patients have abnormalities, and no study has demonstrated a correlation between various carnitine measurements and muscle function.</p><p>The response to L-carnitine can be idiosyncratic; some patients clearly respond with improved muscle function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The usual dose is 1000 mg intravenously at hemodialysis three times weekly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carnitine-metabolism-in-renal-disease-and-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carnitine metabolism in renal disease and dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Recombinant human growth hormone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anabolic effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recombinant-human-growth-hormone-somatropin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">recombinant human growth hormone</a> (rhGH) have been reported in many muscle-wasting conditions, including chronic renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. There is a paucity of data relating to sustained improvement in physical function and strength with rhGH administration. One study of 20 patients who received subcutaneous rhGH at 66.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> or placebo thrice weekly following hemodialysis reported increased handgrip strength and anabolic effects with active therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, given the expense and lack of consistent improvements, most investigators do not recommend the widespread use of growth hormone in dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A phase-III, international, multicenter trial of over 2000 hemodialysis patients was terminated early due to slow recruitment but showed no improvement in grip strength or walking capacity in the 695 patients who received at least one dose of study medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Uremic myopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Animal studies and multiple reports of muscle biopsies in patients receiving dialysis reveal structural, electrolyte, and enzymatic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. Imaging by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also demonstrates gross structural abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. What role each abnormality contributes to the decreased functional status of patients with chronic renal failure is not clear.</p><p>When such changes occur during the course of progressive renal disease is also unclear. Patients with chronic renal failure not yet on dialysis clearly have functional limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p>The clinical significance of structural muscle abnormalities is not clear. One study has suggested that decreased muscle strength, but not decreased muscle mass, is associated with increased mortality among dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. This suggests that a functional assessment may provide prognostic information that is not provided by assessment of muscle mass.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects of exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a modest improvement in exercise ability, strength, and other outcomes with proper training in patients with CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/36-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-40</a>]. In the Renal Exercise Demonstration Project, for example, 286 hemodialysis patients underwent a 16-week exercise program of stationary cycling at the dialysis center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Even with marked improvement at study end, scores in several standard tests of fitness and strength were relatively low, with sit-to-stand test scores and gait speed being 38 and 66 percent of normal values, respectively. Similarly low levels of physical function, in combination with some improvement with training, have been demonstrated in peritoneal dialysis patients with 12 weeks of thrice weekly aerobic exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In addition, high-intensity exercise training, compared with usual exercise, does not significantly improve muscle mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Predialysis patients with CKD also have functional limitations, although rapid improvement can occur with an exercise regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. As an example, 16 patients with a mean creatinine clearance of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> had a 12 percent improvement in peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>max) after four months of exercise three times a week on treadmills and stationary cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Exercise may help preserve muscle mass among nondialysis CKD patients on a low-protein diet. This was found in a 12-week study of 26 patients with CKD (mean GFR of 26 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> who were placed on a 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> protein restriction and randomly assigned to resistance training or sham exercise. Strength improved in the exercise group (32 percent) but declined in the control group (13 percent). In addition, skeletal muscle fiber area, total body potassium, GFR, hematocrit, and body mass had all improved in the exercise group as compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>In another study of nine dialysis patients who participated in a six-month aerobic exercise program and underwent pre- and postexercise muscle biopsies, the histologic benefits with exercise included correction of fiber atrophy and improved capillarization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Yoga during hemodialysis has been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Another benefit of exercise may be a reduction in severity of restless leg syndrome and improvement in sleep quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Diabetics performed worse than nondiabetics.</p><p>After transplantation, abnormalities in strength and endurance remain. Sixteen renal transplant recipients who participated in a six-month program of thrice weekly, 60-minute aerobic exercise sessions and stretching demonstrated substantial improvement in peak oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>max) and strength measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Although animal models and clinical experience confirm the detrimental effects of steroids on muscle structure and function, studies in patients with Cushing's syndrome do not uniformly show muscle atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

Thus, other factors may account in part for the consistent findings of deficits in structure and functions in renal transplant recipients. Nevertheless, early data with steroid withdrawal and avoidance following renal transplantation reveal improved muscle function, with lower steroid regimens and less bone disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-activity-in-patients-with-chronic-kidney-disease-including-end-stage-renal-disease-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>].
