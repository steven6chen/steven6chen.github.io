As the immune system ages and these capabilities decline, there is increased susceptibility to infections and cancer and an increased incidence of autoimmune disorders. The study of age-related changes in immune function is a relatively new area of investigation, which is limited by incomplete understanding of the complexities of immune mechanisms in general [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. At present, most research is focused on defining normal changes in immune function at the basic science level, and much of the available data are from animal studies. In addition, there are no clinical interventions that have been definitively shown to counter immunologic aging.</p><p>This topic will review the changes observed in different components of the immune system with aging. The theoretical implications of these changes on health maintenance and vaccination of older adults are also discussed. Normal aging of other systems, nutrition in older adults, infections in older adults, and geriatric health maintenance (including current recommendations for vaccination) are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-aging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal aging&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric nutrition: Nutritional issues in older adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of infection in the older adult&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-health-maintenance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric health maintenance&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25009826\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOSENESCENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunosenescence refers to the changes that occur in the immune system with increasing age. The clinical consequences of immunosenescence include an increased risk of infections, malignancy, and autoimmune disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10659458\"><span class=\"h2\">Infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumonia and influenza are among the top 10 causes of death in individuals aged 65 and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Nosocomial infections are also significantly increased in older adults. This could be the result of decreased immunologic function in addition to a decreased efficacy of vaccines in older adults. However, there are several other factors that are likely to contribute to increased infections in older adults, including malnutrition, comorbid conditions (eg, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]), diminished mucosal barriers, decreased cough reflex, and mechanical changes to the urinary tract system, among others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The clinical presentation of infections in older patients may be different from that in younger patients. Older adults with severe infections tend to have fewer symptoms and fever is absent or blunted in 20 to 30 percent. This suggests a decreased ability to mount inflammatory cytokine responses in the face of infection. Signs of infection in older adults can be nonspecific and include falls, delirium, anorexia, or generalized weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-infection-in-the-older-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of infection in the older adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p>&quot;Failure to thrive&quot; is a term that has been extrapolated from the pediatric description. In older adults, it is used to describe a gradual decline in physical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cognitive function, usually accompanied by weight loss and social withdrawal that occurs without immediate explanation. Failure to thrive in older adults has been defined as a syndrome manifested by weight loss greater than 5 percent of baseline, decreased appetite, poor nutrition, and inactivity, often accompanied by dehydration, depressive symptoms, impaired immune function, and low cholesterol levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Failure to thrive is not considered a normal consequence of aging, an equivalent to dementia, or a descriptor of the later stages of a terminal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. One important treatable cause of failure to thrive is undetected chronic infections, such as tuberculosis, endocarditis, or bronchiectasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Failure to thrive in elderly adults: Evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Failure to thrive in elderly adults: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10659465\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer incidence and mortality markedly increase after age 65, leveling off around age 85 to 90. Both innate and adaptive arms of the immune system are involved in the first defense against aberrant tumor cells. Patients with primary and acquired immunodeficiency are at increased risk for certain tumors, which is an indication of the immune system's role in defense against malignancy. However, carcinogenesis is a complex phenomenon and the exact role of immunosenescence is difficult to establish. An increased mutational load and carcinogen exposure are likely other contributors to increased malignancy in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10659472\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoimmune disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is an increase in the production of autoantibodies with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In one study of healthy older adults, 28 percent had a positive antiphospholipid antibody, 22 percent had a positive rheumatoid factor, and 14 percent had elevated antinuclear antibodies (ANA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The mechanisms for heightened autoantibody production are not clear, but decreased regulatory T cell function and decreased clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages are two potential explanations.</p><p>As is the case with infections, autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, may present with atypical symptoms in older adults. SLE can present as vague symptoms of weight loss, muscle pain, and cognitive or affective deterioration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a study of patients with RA, older patients were more likely than younger patients to present with symptoms similar to polymyalgia rheumatica and were less likely to have subcutaneous nodules or rheumatoid factor at disease onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Joint scores were also lower.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3021291\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of malnutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adequate nutrition is fundamental to healthy aging. Malnutrition is not uncommon in older adults and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In a Swedish study, malnutrition was present in 60 to 80 percent of patients over 60 years of age admitted to the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In general, energy requirements decrease with age due to a decline in lean body mass and decreased physical activity. Despite this, older adults are at risk for malnutrition due to dental or swallowing problems that might interfere with eating, loss of smell or taste sensations, chronic illnesses that interfere with digestion or absorption of food and increase nutritional requirements, medication side effects, depression and social isolation, <span class=\"nowrap\">functional/visual/cognitive</span> impairments, and economic barriers to obtaining high-quality food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-nutrition-nutritional-issues-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric nutrition: Nutritional issues in older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Malnutrition is associated with immune defects, in particular, a decrease in T cell function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Malnutrition is also associated with an increased risk of and a worse outcome with infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Deficiencies of vitamins A and E [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], vitamin C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], vitamin B12 and folate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>], vitamin B6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], vitamin D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], as well as zinc, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selenium</a>, magnesium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and copper [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], have been described in older adults, although the precise effects of these deficiencies on immune function are not well defined. (See <a href=\"#H1558093\" class=\"local\">'Nutritional supplements and diet'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10659962\"><span class=\"h1\">CHANGES IN SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All immune cells originate from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow, and there is a general decline in the total bone marrow hematopoietic tissue with aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. HSCs, like other cells, undergo progressive loss of telomeric DNA with successive divisions. It is estimated that 50 to 200 base pairs of telomeric DNA is lost with each cell division [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The sequential loss and shortening of telomeric DNA with advancing age lead to an increase in apoptosis (noninflammatory, programmed cell death). In addition to telomere shortening, acquired defects in genomic or mitochondrial DNA also contribute to the decline in HSCs. Overall, the proliferative capacity of HSCs from older people is two to four times less than those from younger subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Differences in regenerating capacity are particularly important during times of illness or other physiologic stress.</p><p>Production of pro-B cells is significantly decreased with aging, resulting in a smaller number of B cells leaving the bone marrow, while T cell precursors seem to be less affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In contrast, age-related changes do not affect erythroid and myeloid progenitors and enhanced myelopoiesis is observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Other age-related changes in the bone marrow are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-aging#H23810861\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal aging&quot;, section on 'Hematopoietic system'</a>.)</p><p>The immune system is divided into innate and adaptive immunity. Innate immunity refers to immune responses that are present from birth and not learned, adapted, or refined as a result of exposure to <span class=\"nowrap\">micro-organisms/antigens</span>. In contrast, adaptive immunity, which consists of the responses of T and B lymphocytes, is generated and then refined during the lifetime of an individual as a result of antigen exposure. Aging affects both innate and adaptive immunity, although innate immune mechanisms are better preserved overall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10833849\"><span class=\"h2\">Innate immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The innate immune system consists of epithelial barriers (skin, gastrointestinal and respiratory mucosa), macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, natural killer T (NKT) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and complement proteins. Nonspecific defense mechanisms, such production of mucus in the proper quantity and viscosity, local antimicrobial peptides, and normal ciliary function are also part of normal defenses. Several age-related changes in the components of the innate immune system have been characterized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F69360\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69360 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Overall, although some innate immune mechanisms are decreased, other mechanisms appear to be more active in older individuals. The result of these changes is a propensity to develop chronic inflammatory states. Thus, the result of aging of the innate immune system may be most accurately characterized as a state of immune dysregulation characterized by low-grade, chronic inflammatory changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Chronic viral infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, may also contribute to this phenomenon, as discussed below (see <a href=\"#H25009937\" class=\"local\">'Immune risk profile and herpesviruses'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Toll-like receptors</strong> &ndash; Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are receptors that are responsible for the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and thus play a very important role in recognizing infecting organisms. It is still unclear as to whether TLR expression is reduced with aging. However, TLR function was found to be decreased in aged mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In humans, cytokine production by monocytes as a result of TLR <span class=\"nowrap\">1/2</span> activation decreases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toll-like receptors: Roles in disease and therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Macrophages</strong> &ndash; Macrophages are an important first-line defense against invading micro-organisms. Macrophages function by recognizing, ingesting, and killing organisms, presenting processed antigens to T cells, and releasing mediators that activate other inflammatory cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system#H9421079\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of the innate immune system&quot;, section on 'Monocytes and macrophages'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antigen-presenting-cells#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antigen-presenting cells&quot;, section on 'Professional APCs'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is a significant decrease in bone marrow macrophage precursors with aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In addition, macrophages from aged rats and mice were found to have reduced production of nitric oxide and the reactive oxygen species that are essential for their killing activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The decreased macrophage activity in older adults may result in a longer duration of infection by extracellular bacteria, as well as delayed wound healing. Deficient production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) by skin macrophages was found to underlie impaired responses to delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) testing with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neutrophils</strong> &ndash; Neutrophils are short-lived cells, important in acute inflammation and in defense against bacterial and fungal organisms. Aging does not affect the total number of neutrophil precursors in the bone marrow or the number of circulating neutrophils in the blood. However, the phagocytic ability of neutrophils is reduced in older adults as compared with younger adults. Studies of superoxide generation by neutrophils in older adult patients have reached varying conclusions, depending upon the conditions used in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Natural killer cells</strong> &ndash; Natural killer (NK) cells are large granular lymphocytes that secrete cytokines and are capable of destroying tumor cells and viral-infected cells. They are defined as being CD56<sup>+</sup> CD3<sup>-</sup>. Peripheral blood NK cells are comprised of around 10 percent CD56<sup>bright </sup>and 90 percent CD56<sup>dim</sup> subsets. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NK cell deficiency syndromes: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Biology of NK cells'</a>.):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CD56<sup>bright</sup> CD16<sup>dim</sup> NK cells function primarily in producing cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and chemokines, and have minimal cytotoxic activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>CD56<sup>dim</sup> CD16<sup>bright</sup> NK cells are highly cytotoxic, and produce lower amounts of cytokines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Unlike other lymphocytes, the NK cell percentage and number tend to increase with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. More than one study noted that the percentage and number of CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells gradually decline with age, while CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells progressively increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Consequently, the ability to produce IFN-gamma was modestly impaired in NK cells from older subjects compared with adult controls, while NK cell cytolytic activity, as well as antibody-dependent cellular toxicity, were preserved in the older population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">NK cells may play an important role in controlling infections in older adults. A study on 108 older adults in nursing homes found a correlation between a low NK cell activity and both increased infection rate and death due to infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In another study, centenarians had preserved or increased NK cell activity, consistent with the concept that these cells are important for successful aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Natural killer T cells</strong> &ndash; Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a subset of T cells (ie, CD3<sup>+</sup>) that shares some characteristics of NK cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. NKT cells are heterogeneous but the majority express an invariant T cell receptor (TCR) alpha chain encoded by <span class=\"nowrap\">V-alpha-24/J-alpha-Q</span> gene segments (these cells are called invariant NKT cells [iNKT]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. NKT cells can be a potent source of IFN-gamma and interleukin-4 (IL-4) and can thus modulate adaptive immune responses. Lymphocytes from older adults were reported to have a decreased percentage of iNKT and these iNKT were more likely to secrete IL-4 rather than IFN-gamma, compared with lymphocytes from young subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nk-cell-deficiency-syndromes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NK cell deficiency syndromes: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Biology of NK cells'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dendritic cells</strong> &ndash; Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent antigen-presenting cells. They play a critical role in the initiation of the immune response by capturing and processing antigens and presenting the processed antigens to other immune cells. They also stimulate the immune system by secreting a number of cytokines and form an important link between innate and adaptive immunity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antigen-presenting-cells#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antigen-presenting cells&quot;, section on 'Professional APCs'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The number of DCs (both myeloid and plasmacytoid DC subsets) does not seem to be affected by aging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F69360\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69360 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The extent of immunosenescence of human DCs remains an area of uncertainty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. There is a suggestion, however, that aging is associated with a numerical and functional decline in plasmacytoid but not myeloid DCs, that the TLR function in DCs from older adults may be decreased, and that such a decrease might determine the adequacy of response to influenza vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One study suggested that upon TLR7 stimulation, DCs from old mice have a reduced ability upregulate costimulatory molecules and to cross-prime na&iuml;ve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. This may have a negative impact on the generation of a robust CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell cytotoxic immune response and may provide an insight as to why severe influenza infection is common in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10833871\"><span class=\"h2\">Adaptive immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adaptive immunity consists of B and T lymphocytes, which mediate humoral and cellular immune responses, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10833693\"><span class=\"h3\">Cellular immunity: T cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several key changes that occur to T cells during aging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78986\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78986 \">table 2</a>). One of the most striking changes of immunosenescence is the involution of the thymus gland.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10833700\"><span class=\"h4\">Thymic involution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Na&iuml;ve T cells are generated from precursors that leave the bone marrow and migrate to the thymus for maturation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development#H1231136\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;, section on 'T cell development'</a>.)</p><p>The thymus gland is most active early in life, reaches maximum size within the first year of life, then undergoes a steady decline with age. By age seven, the part of the thymus with active cell replication (thymopoietic space) represents less than 10 percent of the total thymic space. The functional thymic cortex and medulla are progressively replaced by fatty tissue. These changes are almost complete by age 40 to 50 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. As a result of thymic involution, the number of na&iuml;ve T cells exiting the thymus is significantly decreased, and gets progressively lower between the age groups of 40 to 54, 55 to 69, and 70 to 90 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H922404\"><span class=\"h4\">Changes in T cell subsets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An overall decline in T cell function is apparent with aging, as evidenced by a decline in T cell number and diversity and reduced T cell expansion, differentiation, and signaling intensity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78986\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78986 \">table 2</a>). Specific changes include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T cell receptor (TCR) diversity dramatically decreases after age 65, resulting in a significantly reduced repertoire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. A diverse repertoire is critical for protection from a variety of new infections, especially viral infections. As a result, the ability of T cells to mount an immune response against new antigens declines with age. A study of 44 centenarians found that 84 percent had nondetectable T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs, biomarkers for de novo T cell synthesis), and that these subjects had a low number of na&iuml;ve T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In contrast, numbers of terminally differentiated cells in centenarians were not different from those in young or middle-aged subjects. These findings suggest that production of new T cells is dramatically reduced in the very old, and T cell populations are largely composed of persistent long-lived lymphocytes. Age-related defects in the signaling pathways of na&iuml;ve CD4 T cells have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a decrease in the numbers of CD4 T cells, an increase in CD8 T cells, and a decrease in the costimulatory molecule CD28 with aging.

B cells respond to antigen exposure (ie, through infections or vaccinations) by producing antibodies, which then bind to antigens to fight concurrent infections or prevent future infections. Na&iuml;ve B cells produce primarily immunoglobulin M (IgM). Upon stimulation with antigen, B cells switch to the production of immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), or immunoglobulin E (IgE). The ability of B cells to respond to antigens and produce antibodies is a main measure of their functional capacity.

An example of this phenomenon was seen during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, in which older adults were better protected from H1N1 infection than middle-aged adults, probably because of the persistence of memory lymphocytes producing neutralizing cross-reactive antibodies generated in response to an H1N1 virus that circulated prior to 1957 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].

As discussed above, a recurring question in the older adults is how much of their longevity is determined by inheritance and how much is determined by lifestyle. Studies of monozygotic twins are valuable in answering this question. One seminal study involved an analysis of 105 pairs of healthy twins (78 monozygotic and 27 dizygotic pairs) between 8 and 82 years of age, and measured 204 different parameters including cell population frequencies, cytokine responses, and serum proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. They found that 77 percent of these measures are dominated by, and 58 percent were almost completely determined by nonheritable influences. Twin discordance increased steadily with age, suggesting that the effects of environmental exposures on the immune system are cumulative. Interestingly, the discordance was most apparent in measurements relating to T and B cells. In addition to the in vitro parameters, this study measured serological responses to seasonal influenza vaccination and found them to be determined largely by nonheritable factors. The importance of infections across a life span is also illustrated by the finding that monozygotic twins discordant for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection showed greatly reduced correlations for many immune cell frequencies such as effector CD8 and gamma-delta T cells.

Telomeres play a role in preventing DNA degradation by protecting the chromosome end from recombination and fusion with another telomere or DNA end. The telomere length is an indication of the cell replication history and replicative capacity of normal somatic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Leukocyte telomere length is sometimes used as a biomarker of oxidative stress and injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Telomere length and inflammation markers were examined in a study of 1554 Japanese individuals including 684 centenarians and semi-super centenarians (105 or older), 167 pairs of centenarian (100 to 104 years old) offspring and spouses, and 536 very old (85 to 99 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Inflammation was a more significant predictor of all-cause mortality for the very old and semi-super centenarians, respectively.

Interestingly, the inflammation score was lower in centenarian offspring compared with age-matched controls. Another study examined DNA methylation level, a general marker of epigenetic effects, in 82 semi-super centenarians, 63 of their offspring, and 47 age-matched controls and found that the offspring of semi-super centenarians had a lower epigenetic age than age matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-function-in-older-adults/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25009937\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune risk profile and herpesviruses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although most studies look at the effects of aging on the immune system, other lines of research suggest that immunosenescence itself may be a major contributor to the process of aging.

The clinical consequences of immunosenescence include an increased risk of infections, malignancy, and autoimmune disorders. Malnutrition is relatively common among older adults and can contribute to declining immune function. (See <a href=\"#H25009826\" class=\"local\">'Immunosenescence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aging affects both innate and adaptive immunity, although adaptive processes are affected more dramatically. (See <a href=\"#H10659962\" class=\"local\">'Changes in specific components of the immune system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The innate immune system consists of epithelial barriers, antimicrobial peptides and mucus, as well as macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, natural killer T (NKT) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and complement proteins. Some innate immune mechanisms decline with age, while others appear to become more active. The clinical consequence of this increased activity results in a state of immune dysregulation characterized by low-grade, chronic proinflammatory changes. (See <a href=\"#H10833849\" class=\"local\">'Innate immunity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The adaptive immune system consists of B and T cell responses. With aging, na&iuml;ve T and B cells decline, while the functions of memory cells are relatively preserved. (See <a href=\"#H10833871\" class=\"local\">'Adaptive immunity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>T cells originate from the thymus, which is active in youth and then undergoes dramatic involution by middle age, with a continued gradual decline in function thereafter. The number of na&iuml;ve T cells exiting the thymus is significantly decreased, and na&iuml;ve T cells capable of responding to new infections and antigens drop in number, reducing the T cell repertoire. There is a corresponding decrease in the number of T regulatory cells (Tregs), which keep the immune system &quot;in check&quot; by maintaining homeostasis, limiting autoimmune responses, and modulating the inflammatory response to infectious agents and tumors. (See <a href=\"#H10833693\" class=\"local\">'Cellular immunity: T cells'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>B cells numbers decrease with age, although immunoglobulin levels do not change or sometimes increase. Despite the preservation of the overall amount of immunoglobulin, specific antibody production declines and the ability of B and T cells to interact and respond vigorously to vaccinations and new infections becomes limited. (See <a href=\"#H10833707\" class=\"local\">'Humoral immunity: B cells'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At present, immunosenescence is not routinely measured in clinical practice, although several parameters, such as leukocyte telomere length and the &quot;immune risk profile,&quot; are used in research settings.

In addition, vaccination against common herpesviruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), may someday limit the contribution of these viruses to &quot;immunologic exhaustion.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H922040\" class=\"local\">'Potential interventions to counter immunosenescence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of the immune system in older adults is similar to that in younger adults, with a greater emphasis on disorders leading to secondary immunodeficiency.
