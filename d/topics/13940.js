There is general consensus that some degree of postoperative ileus is a normal obligatory and physiologic response to abdominal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Physiologic postoperative ileus is generally a benign condition that resolves without serious sequelae. However, when ileus is prolonged, it leads to patient discomfort, dissatisfaction, and prolonged hospitalization, and it must be differentiated from mechanical bowel obstruction or other postoperative complications. </p><p>The epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of postoperative ileus are reviewed here.

The nature of the surgery, intraoperative complications, and medical comorbidities need to be taken into consideration when distinguishing physiologic from pathologic causes of postoperative ileus. Some degree of postoperative ileus is a normal obligatory and physiologic response to abdominal surgery. The physiologic postoperative ileus that typically follows surgery has a benign and self-limited course. However, when ileus is prolonged, it leads to patient discomfort and dissatisfaction, and must be differentiated from other potential complications. However, a lack of consensus on what constitutes a normal physiologic response has hindered the development of a meaningful clinical definition of &quot;prolonged&quot; (or &quot;pathologic&quot;) postoperative ileus. </p><p>Following abdominal surgery, &quot;normal&quot; physiologic postoperative ileus due to postoperative gut dysmotility is widely reported as lasting 0 to 24 hours in the small intestine, 24 to 48 hours in the stomach, and 48 to 72 hours in the colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/2,6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-9</a>]. However, this belief has been challenged; the duration of postoperative gastrointestinal dysmotility appears to be shorter than previously thought. Generally, gastric and small intestinal activity appear to return within hours of surgery, and colonic activity returns by postoperative day 2 or 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/5,10-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10-16</a>]. Although the most affected parts of the intestine are those that have been manipulated during the surgery, there is experimental evidence that inflammation of the intestinal muscle extends from manipulated areas to nonmanipulated parts of the intestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. When the expected period of time extends beyond what is acceptable, the patient is diagnosed as having a &quot;prolonged&quot; or &quot;pathologic&quot; postoperative ileus, provided there are no signs of mechanical intestinal obstruction (see <a href=\"#H547644590\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below). </p><p>A wide variety of endpoints have been used to measure gut recovery with no consensus as to which one is most clinically meaningful. In randomized trials of patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, time to recovery of gastrointestinal function has been assessed as time to first solid food, and time to either bowel movement or flatus, whichever occurs later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Systematic reviews note that when a definition of postoperative ileus is stated, the timeframe is not given or is inconsistent between studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Definitions of &quot;prolonged&quot; postoperative ileus have included: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No return of bowel function postoperatively (ranging from postoperative days 4 to 6)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of flatus or stool on postoperative day 6 </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperative nausea or vomiting requiring cessation of oral intake, intravenous support, or nasogastric tube placement by postoperative day 5</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Return of bowel function after postoperative day 5</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of flatus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bowel movement prolonging hospitalization beyond discharge goal (ranging from postoperative days 6 to 8) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of bowel activity more than five days after surgery </p><p/><p>What constitutes an acceptable length of gastrointestinal recovery time also depends on the type of surgery. As an example, in the placebo arms of randomized trials evaluating prevention of postoperative ileus after bowel resection or total abdominal hysterectomy, the mean time to GI-2 recovery (composite endpoint defined as the later of time to first toleration of solid food or time to first bowel movement) after bowel resection was five days, and time to GI-3 recovery (later of time to first toleration of solid food or time to first passage of either flatus or stool) was 4.5 days; these were 4.8 and 2.9 days after hysterectomy, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. There are few data comparing gastrointestinal recovery times for abdominal versus retroperitoneal surgery.</p><p>An international consensus panel proposed that &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;obligatory&quot; postoperative ileus be defined as the period of time, lasting fewer than four days, from surgery until the passage of flatus or stool and tolerance of an oral diet. The same panel defined &quot;prolonged&quot; postoperative ileus as the occurrence of two or more of the following signs and symptoms on postoperative day 4 or after [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to tolerate an oral diet over the preceding 24 hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of flatus over the preceding 24 hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal distention</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiologic confirmation </p><p/><p>It is well recognized, however, that some of these signs and symptoms may not be objective (eg, assessment of distention, radiographic interpretation), or may be confounded by causes other than postoperative ileus (eg, nausea due to medications).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H547644233\"><span class=\"h1\">GASTROINTESTINAL PHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal gastrointestinal motility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Control of gastrointestinal function and motor activity is complex and based upon the interactions of various neural networks and neurohumoral peptides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-peptides-in-health-and-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal peptides in health and disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Neurons located in the gut wall comprise the intrinsic neural network, which is called the enteric nervous system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50829\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50829 \">figure 1</a>). The enteric nervous system also has the basic circuitry necessary to run independently through local circuits that rely on signals from intrinsic sensory neurons and neurohumoral peptides, such as substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and nitric oxide, which can act either in a paracrine or endocrine fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p>The extrinsic network consists of visceral sensory afferents in the vagus, splanchnic, and pelvic nerves, and visceral motor efferents of the autonomic nervous system. These extrinsic neurons synapse with the enteric nervous system and connect it to the central nervous system. In general, vagal afferents are thought to be important in the coordinated integration of motility, secretion, and absorption, while spinal afferents are thought to be responsible for the transmission of noxious stimuli and inflammation. Visceral motor efferent outflow consists of the sympathetic thoracolumbar and parasympathetic craniosacral arms of the autonomic nervous system. Sympathetic activity is generally inhibitory to smooth muscle activity, while parasympathetic input can be excitatory or inhibitory.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal dysmotility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative gastrointestinal dysmotility is generally related to one or more of the mechanisms (inflammation, neural reflexes, neurohumoral peptides) described below. The inflammatory and the neurohumoral pathways appear to be interrelated as activated inflammatory cells release a variety of substances (eg, cytokines, cyclooxygenase-2 [COX-2], and leukocyte-derived inducible nitric oxide synthase) that further increase inflammatory cell recruitment and inhibit gastrointestinal motility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postoperative ileus following abdominal surgery appears to result from an inflammatory response to intestinal manipulation and trauma. This observation is supported by animal studies showing that the degree of intestinal manipulation of both the small and large intestine is directly related to both the degree of leukocyte infiltration into the intestinal muscularis and the amount of intestinal dysmotility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Moreover, this effect is not necessarily limited to the manipulated segment, as there appears to be an inflammatory field effect affecting the entire gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/17,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,30</a>]. Nonabdominal procedures have also been shown to lead to intestinal inflammation. The mechanism for this remains poorly understood but it is hypothesized to originate by reduced intestinal blood perfusion (ischemia) and translocation of endogenous cellular danger molecules and cytokines from the distant site of surgical trauma. </p><p>Intestinal manipulation activates a network of local macrophages triggering an inflammatory response that results in muscle dysfunction. Depletion and inactivation of these resident macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], as well as treatment with Semapimod, a powerful anti-cytokine molecule, have prevented postoperative ileus in rodents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/18,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,32</a>]. Intestinal manipulation also appears to increase COX-2 expression and to elevate prostaglandin levels, which, in turn, decreases jejunal contractility. This effect is blocked in COX-2 deficient mice and by the administration of selective COX-2 inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In addition, studies suggest that cells of the enteric nervous system also contribute to the inflammation by releasing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measures-to-prevent-prolonged-postoperative-ileus#H21238184\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measures to prevent prolonged postoperative ileus&quot;, section on 'COX-2 inhibition'</a>.)</p><p>Mast cells were once thought to play a role in the development of postoperative ileus since mast cell stabilizers prevent surgically-induced intestinal inflammation and dysmotility, and mast cell deficiencies limit intestinal leukocyte migration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, a study using a more specific mast cell deficient mouse model demonstrated that mast cells do not appear to be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H547644344\"><span class=\"h3\">Inhibitory neural reflexes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhibitory neural reflexes are thought to act locally through noxious spinal afferent signals that increase inhibitory sympathetic activity in the gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/25,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,37</a>]. The clinical importance of this mechanism is that blockade of spinal afferents with epidural local anesthetics or with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> can improve postoperative ileus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measures-to-prevent-prolonged-postoperative-ileus#H547645419\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measures to prevent prolonged postoperative ileus&quot;, section on 'Midthoracic epidural'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Neurohumoral peptides</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nitric oxide, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and possibly substance P, are thought to act as inhibitory neurotransmitters in the gut which slow gut motility. In rats, antagonists to these peptides improve surgically-induced gastrointestinal dysmotility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. The contribution of substance P is only partially understood; its inhibitory effects may be related to its stimulation of inhibitory sensory signals rather than stimulatory motor activity directly in the gut. Decreases in motilin (a motor-stimulatory hormone), and increases in the inhibitory factors calcitonin gene-related peptide and corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) have also been implicated in the pathophysiology of postoperative ileus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/37,38,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38,42-44</a>].</p><p>Opioids have well-known inhibitory effects on the gastrointestinal tract. They increase resting tone while decreasing gastric motility and emptying, increase small intestinal periodic spasms, and decrease propulsive colonic movements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/4,8,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8,45,46</a>]. These effects seem to be receptor specific and appear to be mediated primarily at the level of the enteric nervous system.

Exposure to general anesthesia is commonly believed to play a role in depressing postoperative intestinal motility, but this is not well proven, and its role, if any, is likely minor and transient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>].

The radiographic features of small bowel obstruction are discussed elsewhere, and may overlap with those of ileus, especially in the case of partial small bowel obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52448\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52448 \">table 2</a>). If the diagnosis is unclear, computed tomography of the abdomen should be obtained.

(See <a href=\"#H547643185\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic versus pathologic postoperative ileus'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of the patient with suspected prolonged postoperative ileus should exclude other surgical entities that can lead to postoperative abdominal distention and decreased bowel activity, such as small bowel obstruction and bowel perforation. In addition, secondary causes of ileus and nonobstructive bowel dysfunction, such as intra-abdominal abscess or retroperitoneal bleeding, should be investigated. Some of these may require surgical management or other interventions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70101\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70101 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Distinguishing prolonged postoperative ileus from mechanical small bowel obstruction is of critical importance and can be challenging as they share many of the same signs and symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52448\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52448 \">table 2</a>). It is useful to note that nearly all patients with early postoperative bowel obstruction have an initial return of bowel function and oral intake, which is then followed by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and distention, whereas patients with ileus generally do not experience return of bowel function. Small bowel obstruction may be more likely in the presence of potential areas of bowel herniation (eg, other prior incisions, known inguinal or femoral hernia, stomas, adhesions, other surgeries associated with internal hernias), masses (intraluminal or extraluminal), large tumor burden, or peritoneal metastases. Intense cramping pain, feculent emesis, or rapidly progressing pain or distention are more suggestive of bowel obstruction than prolonged postoperative ileus. Localized tenderness, fever, tachycardia, and peritoneal signs suggest bowel ischemia or perforation, which indicate the need for emergent surgical intervention. Although postoperative ileus and noncomplicated bowel obstruction can each be initially managed conservatively, prolonged or worsening small bowel obstruction ultimately requires surgery to prevent complications (eg, ischemia, necrosis, perforation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of management of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When the combination of history, findings on physical examination, and plain radiography cannot distinguish ileus from small bowel obstruction, we suggest computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen. Abdominal CT with oral contrast has a sensitivity and specificity of 90 to 100 percent in distinguishing ileus from complete small bowel obstruction, although it is less reliable in distinguishing ileus from partial small bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/88-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">88-91</a>]. Moreover, abdominal CT can often identify secondary causes of ileus, such as a pelvic abscess, postoperative bleeding, and in cases of small bowel obstruction, may identify a site of obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50457\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50457 \">image 2</a>) or suggest the presence of strangulated, ischemic, or necrotic bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/90,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,92</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults#H267635470\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;, section on 'Confirming the diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>If the diagnosis remains uncertain after abdominal CT and the patient's condition persists, upper gastrointestinal contrast studies (enteroclysis) with water-soluble radio-opaque contrast material (eg, Gastrografin) should be considered. Enteroclysis is particularly useful for distinguishing ileus from partial small bowel obstruction, which more closely mimics ileus than complete small bowel obstruction, and for identifying the severity of partial obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults#H13723306\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;, section on 'When to obtain other studies'</a>.)</p><p>Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction may be due to a variety of medical and surgical conditions, and should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of postoperative ileus.

Although Gastrografin has been used therapeutically to treat adhesive small bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>], its efficacy in treating prolonged postoperative ileus remains unproven. Based upon available evidence, we do not recommend using Gastrografin in the treatment of prolonged postoperative ileus beyond diagnostic purposes.</p><p>Gastrografin has been studied in two small randomized trials of patients who had prolonged ileus after surgery. In one trial, orally administered Gastrografin accelerated time to flatus or stool (18.9 versus 32.7 hours) and time to resolution of abdominal distension (52.8 versus 77.7 hours), but did not affect time to resolution of nausea and vomiting (64.5 versus 74.3 hours) or time to tolerance of oral diet (75.8 versus 90.0 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. The other trial reported no significant differences in mean time to resolution of postoperative ileus between the Gastrografin and control groups (9.1 versus 10.3 days), but length of stay, time needing a nasogastric tube, and time until tolerance of oral intake all tended to improve with Gastrografin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/postoperative-ileus/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H547648146\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postoperative ileus refers to obstipation and intolerance of oral intake following abdominal or nonabdominal surgery. It is due to nonmechanical factors, primarily inflammation of the intestinal smooth muscle, leading to disruption of the normal coordinated propulsive motor activity of the gastrointestinal tract. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H547644233\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal physiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of postoperative ileus varies widely in the surgical literature, and depends upon the definition of postoperative ileus that is used and the type of surgery. The most important risk factors for prolonged postoperative ileus include: prolonged abdominal or pelvic surgery, lower gastrointestinal surgery, open surgery, delayed enteral <span class=\"nowrap\">nutrition/nasogastric</span> tube placement, intra-abdominal inflammation, postoperative complications, and possibly increased body mass index. (See <a href=\"#H547644526\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some degree of postoperative ileus is a normal obligatory and physiologic response to abdominal surgery. Postoperative ileus can also occur following non-abdominal surgery. The duration of postoperative gastrointestinal dysmotility appears to be shorter than historically reported with gastric and small intestinal activity returning within hours of surgery, and colonic activity returning by postoperative day 2 to 3. Physiologic postoperative ileus is generally a benign condition that resolves without serious sequelae. (See <a href=\"#H547643185\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic versus pathologic postoperative ileus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged postoperative ileus is said to occur when one or more of the following symptoms or signs persists for more than three to five days (depending on the nature of the surgery and what is considered &quot;typical&quot;). (See <a href=\"#H547644590\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abdominal distention, bloating, and &quot;gassiness&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Diffuse, persistent abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Delayed passage of or inability to pass flatus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inability to tolerate an oral diet</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of the patient with suspected postoperative ileus includes history and physical, plain radiography, and laboratory studies including CBC, electrolyte panel including magnesium, BUN, liver function tests, amylase and lipase. This work-up seeks to exclude other causes of ileus, and surgical entities that can lead to postoperative abdominal distention and decreased bowel activity that may require surgical management or other intervention, such as small bowel obstruction, bowel perforation, intra-abdominal abscess, or retroperitoneal bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plain radiographs demonstrating air in the colon and rectum, with no transition zone or free air support a diagnosis of postoperative ileus and may be adequate for distinguishing postoperative ileus from small bowel obstruction. However, if there remains any suspicion for small bowel obstruction or another diagnosis, we suggest computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen. (See <a href=\"#H547644590\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No studies have identified any specific therapy, other than supportive care, to resolve prolonged postoperative ileus. Supportive care includes pain control that minimizes opioid use, intravenous fluid and electrolyte therapy, dietary restriction, and selective placement of a nasogastric tube for gastrointestinal decompression for those with persistent <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting</span>. The patient should be closely monitored with serial abdominal examinations for improvement or worsening of their condition. Additional imaging studies are warranted if conservative measures do not improve the patient&rsquo;s condition in 48 to 72 hours.
