However, this risk is greatly influenced by genetic factors. As an example, skin type, a heritable trait, modifies the risk presented by a given amount of solar exposure. Dark-skinned populations have a much lower incidence of melanoma than fairer skinned populations exposed to equivalent sunlight. In the United States, the risk for melanoma in the white population is approximately 20 times higher than in the black population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>However, there are other inherited factors, aside from those that define pigmentation, that contribute to hereditary risk. A study of familial risk and hereditability identified 23,980 people who had cancer and were twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The risk of concordance for melanoma was much greater than in the general population, and the increase was more pronounced in monozygotic compared with dizygotic twins. From this data, the heritability (ie, the proportion of variation of risk that can be attributed to genetic variation) of melanoma was estimated to be 58 percent.</p><p>Significant progress has been made toward understanding the genes that contribute to inherited susceptibility for melanoma in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Uncommon but high-risk alleles contribute to the hereditary cancer phenotype that includes multiple cases of the associated cancer or cancers on one side of the family, multiple primary cancers in a given individual, and early age of onset for a given cancer. With advances in genomic technologies and the conceptual framework to isolate more prevalent but lower risk alleles, the spectrum of genetic variants that contribute to melanoma risk has expanded.</p><p>The hereditary risk factors for melanoma are discussed here, along with potential implications for genetic screening. Other risk factors associated with the development of melanoma are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for the development of melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3663025564\"><span class=\"h1\">HEREDITARY VERSUS SPORADIC MELANOMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Melanomas can be divided into those that are sporadic and those that have a hereditary component. Sporadic melanomas are due to random acquired mutations in melanocytes. Acquired mutations may be due to the environment, aging, chance events, or other nonheritable factors.</p><p>An estimated 8 to 12 percent of patients with melanoma have a family history of the disease. However, not all of these individuals have hereditary melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In some cases, the apparent familial inheritance pattern may be due to clustering of sporadic cases in families with common heavy sun exposure and a susceptible skin type. In other situations, co-inheritance of modifying genes may enhance or inhibit the apparent penetrance of a high-risk mutation and thus dictate the strength of the family history.</p><p>In areas of moderate to high incidence of melanoma, families with three relatives with melanoma, individuals with three or more primary melanomas, or individuals with melanoma diagnosed at an earlier age are candidates for hereditary melanoma susceptibility testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Twenty to 60 percent of these families harbor a mutation in <em>CDKN2A</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/p16</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma/abstract/7,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9-11</a>]. </p><p>Less common melanoma susceptibly genes include <em>CDKN2A</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>ARF</em>,</span> <em>CDK4</em>, <em>TERT</em>, <em>MITF</em>, <em>BAP1</em>, and <em>POT1</em>. Other genes that may soon be included in hereditary melanoma testing include <em>ACD</em>, <em>MC1R</em>, <em>RB1</em>, and <em>TERF2IP</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>In addition, there are other cancer predisposition syndromes in which melanoma is part of a broader spectrum of tumors but is not the most common malignancy. An example of this is <em>BRCA</em>-associated hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. In this condition, the primary risks are for breast and ovarian cancers, but the risks of some other malignancies are also increased, including melanoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes#H153668887\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes&quot;, section on 'BRCA-associated hereditary breast and ovarian cancer'</a>.)</p><p>These cancer predisposition syndromes may be classified into those in which melanoma is the most frequent manifestation and those in which melanoma is less common than other tumor types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Strong evidence for linkage to this region came from an analysis of 11 melanoma pedigrees in Texas and Utah [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Subsequent studies using positional cloning methods isolated a candidate locus that was ultimately designated <em>CDKN2A</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. This gene has also been called <em>MTS1</em>, <em>p16INK4A</em>, and <em>CDKN2</em>. The gene encodes two proteins, p16 and p14ARF, that are transcribed in alternate reading frames through the use of alternative first exons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Germline <em>CDKN2A</em> mutations in melanoma families are usually missense or nonsense changes that impair the function of p16, although rare mutations in <em>p14ARF</em> have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma/abstract/9,10,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,18</a>]. </p><p>The p16 protein is a negative regulator of cell cycle progression at the <span class=\"nowrap\">G1/S</span> checkpoint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. It interacts with the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs; CDK4 or CDK6), enzymes that control early events in the cell cycle, to catalyze phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma family of proteins. A complex of cyclin D and CDK together phosphorylate the retinoblastoma gene protein (RB1), thereby releasing the transcription factor E2F1 from RB1 and allowing E2F1 to induce S phase genes. Consequently, the cell proceeds from G1 arrest through S phase. The p16 protein binds to and inhibits CDK4, and thus serves as a brake on cell cycle progression. </p><p>Inactivating mutations of p16 disrupt its inhibitory function on CDK4, thereby permitting inappropriate progression through the cell cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Tumorigenesis may result from an impairment in senescence, cell differentiation, or cell death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

Using these criteria, 385 families with three or more patients with melanoma from the Melanoma Genetics Consortium (GenoMEL) were compared across various geographical locales. Overall, 39 percent of these selected families had <em>CDKN2A</em> mutations, ranging from 20 percent (32 of 162) in Australia to 45 percent (29 of 65) in North America to 57 percent (89 of 157) in Europe. The presence of pancreatic cancer in a given family also predicted <em>CDKN2A</em> mutations, except for in Australian families.</p><p>The prevalence of germline <em>CDKN2A</em> mutations in the general population with melanoma is much lower than in studies of multiple-case families, which may reflect the presence of other co-inherited risk alleles, increased detection bias, or unknown confounders in these cohorts. This was illustrated by a study of 3550 patients with melanoma in which 65 <em>CDKN2A</em> mutation carriers were identified (1.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]; the rates of <em>CDKN2A</em> mutations among individuals with a single primary melanoma and multiple primary melanomas were 1.2 and 2.9 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Mutation penetrance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimates of the penetrance of <em>CDKN2A</em> mutations among carriers vary depending upon the methods of population ascertainment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the multicenter Genes Environment and Melanoma (GEM) study, histories were obtained from 429 first-degree relatives of index cases, seeking cases of melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In these individuals, the incidence of melanoma in <em>CDKN2A</em> carriers was estimated to be 14, 24, and 28 percent at 50, 70, and 80 years of age, respectively. This compared to an incidence of melanoma of 1.5, 4.5, and 6.2 percent in the relatives of non-<em>CDKN2A</em> carriers and an estimated 0.6, 1.6, and 2.6 percent in the baseline population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the GenoMEL study, which was based upon 80 families with documented <em>CDKN2A</em> mutations and multiple affected family members, the incidence of melanoma was 30 percent by age 50 years and 67 percent by age 80 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The higher penetrance observed in this study at least in part reflects the bias induced by only analyzing families with two or more cases. An interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental factors was suggested in this series by geographic variations. In Europe, the United States, and Australia, mutation penetrance at age 80 years was 58, 76, and 91 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p>The same factors that influence the incidence of melanoma in the general population (eg, total nevus count, presence of dysplastic nevi, sunburn) also affect <em>CDKN2A</em> penetrance. This was illustrated in a study of 53 melanoma-prone families and 295 families ascertained through probands diagnosed with melanoma but unselected for family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-susceptibility-to-melanoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The presence of both sunburn and a melanoma predisposing gene increased the risk of melanoma 15 times more than in noncarriers. In families with <em>CDKN2A</em> mutations, total nevus count, dysplastic nevi, and sunburn all significantly increased the risk of developing melanoma. In addition, the presence of variants in the <em>MC1R</em> gene increases the risk of developing melanoma in <em>CDKN2A</em> carriers.
