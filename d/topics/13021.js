The majority of disease is related to reactivation of latent infection. However, the introduction of potent combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens in 1996 has led to changes in the incidence, natural history, management, and sequelae of CMV retinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations, pathogenesis, risk factors, and diagnosis of CMV retinitis are discussed here. The treatment of CMV retinitis and the use of antiretroviral therapy for the treatment of HIV are reviewed separately.

Prior to the availability of potent combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 1996, CMV retinitis occurred in 21 to 44 percent of patients with AIDS, primarily in those with a CD4 T lymphocyte count below 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. In early case series, patients who survived beyond six months without CMV-specific treatment became severely visually impaired or blind. The median time to progression of disease into previously uninvolved areas of the retina while on CMV-specific antiviral therapy was 47 to 104 days, mean survival after diagnosis was 6 to 10 months, and indefinite maintenance therapy was essential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>However, the introduction of potent combination ART has had a dramatic impact on CMV disease in the HIV-infected patient. CMV disease essentially occurs only in patients with advanced immunosuppression, such as those who are either not receiving or have failed to respond to ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the era prior to the availability of potent ART regimens, the incidence of CMV retinitis was high. As an example, in one observational study, approximately 25 percent of AIDS patients with a CD4 count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> developed CMV retinitis during four years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, in the placebo arm of a clinical trial of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> prophylaxis, which enrolled AIDS patients with a CD4 count of &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> or patients with a history of an AIDS-defining opportunistic infection and a CD4 count &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> the incidence of CMV retinitis was 24 percent after only 12 months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>However, the incidence of CMV retinitis has decreased by 80 percent or more since modern ART regimens became available and survival after diagnosis has increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>].

The four-year incidence rate of CMV retinitis was 12 percent, a 52 percent reduction compared with historical data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A more dramatic reduction in the incidence of CMV retinitis was observed by the San Francisco Department of Public Health&rsquo;s active surveillance program. From 1996 to 2000 and 2001 to 2008, the incidence of CMV retinitis after an initial AIDS diagnosis decreased by 94 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>CMV retinitis continues to be a cause of blindness among patients with AIDS in low- and middle-income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. In a systematic review of HIV-infected individuals from such countries, the prevalence of CMV retinitis from 2009 to 2013 was reported to be as high as 17.6 percent (95% CI, 12.6-22.7%) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The highest prevalence was observed in Asia, and approximately 30 percent of patients with CMV retinitis experienced blindness in one or both eyes. In a report from Myanmar, approximately one-third of patients with AIDS-related CMV retinitis died within three months of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect on clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initiation of ART may also lead to different clinical presentations of symptomatic CMV disease, in the setting of immune reconstitution:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may present with CMV retinitis in the setting of higher CD4 counts (&gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> secondary to early immunologic recovery of T-cells after initiation of ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This emphasizes the fact that early immune reconstitution is &quot;incomplete&quot; and the patient is still at risk for opportunistic infections early during treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Thus, clinicians should not eliminate the possibility of CMV retinitis simply based on a relatively high CD4 count.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients who have quiescent CMV retinitis (or subclinical CMV retinal infection) at the time potent antiretroviral therapy is initiated, subsequently develop new areas of retinal opacification within the first months after responding to antiretroviral treatment with a rise in their absolute CD4+ T cell counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. These new retinal lesions are either located on the border of previous healed lesions or may be the initial clinical presentation of CMV retinitis. In patients already on maintenance anti-CMV therapy, this new retinal opacification does not signify a failure of the anti-CMV therapy or antiretroviral therapy, and the lesions subsequently heal with continuation of the same anti-CMV regimen.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Morbidity and mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The introduction of potent ART was also associated with decreased morbidity and mortality related to ocular involvement, slower rates of retinal progression, ocular complications, and improved survival after diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the era before potent combination ART, the rates of visual loss in eyes were substantial. The two major causes were retinitis, involving either the macula or the optic nerve, and retinal detachment.

However, patients with CMV retinitis who initiate ART are at risk of developing an ocular inflammatory syndrome, termed immune recovery uveitis, which can cause substantial vision loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

In a study of 376 consecutive patients with AIDS and unilateral CMV retinitis, subjects were followed for the development of second-eye retinitis. The use of ART was associated with a 46 percent reduction in incidence of retinitis in the uninvolved eye compared to untreated patients. Rates of retinal detachment have also been reduced compared to historical controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large observational cohort of 1583 AIDS patients who were enrolled between 1998 and 2003, mortality rates among patients with a baseline CD4 count &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> were similar in those with or without a history of CMV retinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">CMV specific immune responses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although ART clearly leads to restoration of immune protection against further progression of CMV retinitis in nearly all CMV retinitis patients who respond to potent antiretroviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/18,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,27,28</a>], it is not clear whether ART leads to complete restoration of CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As an example, in one longitudinal study of a CMV-specific CD8+ interferon gamma cytokine flow cytometry assay, immune responses in 10 patients with active CMV retinitis were compared to 20 patients who had a history of CMV retinitis and who successfully discontinued maintenance therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. CD8+ T cell responses were demonstrated in only 3 of 10 patients with active CMV retinitis compared to all 20 patients with a past history of CMV, suggesting full restoration of this critical CMV-specific T cell response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an observational study of 87 patients with CD4 T counts less than 50 cells, positive baseline CMV-specific interferon gamma responses identified by ELISPOT (enzyme-linked immunospot) assay, were associated with delayed development of CMV viremia, end-organ disease, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Factors associated with positive ELISPOT results were higher CD4 T cell counts, lower HIV RNA levels, and longer duration of ART. However, reconstitution of CMV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses (as measured by flow cytometry) were not observed during the study.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study identified three CMV-specific T cell parameters that discriminated between patients with active CMV retinitis and those who had full clinical recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, when these parameters were examined in a large, longitudinal study, they were not useful in predicting risk of developing CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS, possibly because the interval between the decrease in critical CMV-specific T cell subsets and the onset of retinitis was very short [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many studies support the hypothesis that CMV retinitis results from hematogenous spread of CMV to the eye. Studies in transplant recipients and patients with AIDS indicate that CD4-dependent cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity of CMV antigen-specific CD8+ T cells is critical for preventing CMV replication and end-organ disease, and that impaired CD4 cell function or number is the key immune deficit that permits uncontrolled CMV replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/29,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,35,36</a>].</p><p>Although most cases of CMV retinitis occur in patients with a CD4 count &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> patients may be predisposed before such severe CD4 cell depletion as illustrated below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a longitudinal, prospective study, patients with AIDS who subsequently developed CMV retinitis had lower T-cell proliferative responses (in an assay that primarily measured CD4+ T cell proliferation) to CMV both early and late in disease, compared to patients who did not develop retinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Genetic factors may contribute to this predisposition since low responses to CMV were more common in those with HLA B44 and DR7.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A longitudinal study analyzed the dynamics of CMV-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses in parallel with CMV DNA in 19 HIV-infected patients, 10 of whom had progression to CMV end-organ disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In individuals progressing to end-organ disease, CMV-specific IFN-gamma producing CD4+ T cells disappeared during the year before onset of clinical disease. This decline was accompanied by a sharp increase in CMV DNA before symptom onset.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is also evidence that higher proportions of regulatory T cells and of CMV-specific T-cell responses, which are characteristic of regulatory T cells, are associated with an increased risk of AIDS-related CMV end-organ disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p>In addition, there may be other genetic predispositions to developing CMV retinitis. For example, CMV contains a human interleukin-10 (IL-10) homolog in its genome to evade host immune reactions. Variants of the human IL-10 receptor may influence susceptibility to developing CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CMV retinitis is characterized histologically by full-thickness retinal necrosis and edema that is subsequently replaced by thin, atrophic scar tissue. This scar tissue is susceptible to tearing, which can lead to subsequent retinal detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Without antiviral treatment or immune reconstitution, the retinal lesions enlarge centrifugally. The portions of the retina destroyed by CMV do not regenerate functionally. Thus, the goal of therapy for CMV retinitis is to prevent further retinal necrosis and loss of vision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">CMV viremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of CMV virus in blood (as measured by culture, CMV DNA amplification, or antigen detection) has been studied as a risk factor for the development of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS with varying results.</p><p>Several studies initiated before 1996 suggested a close association between CMV viremia and risk of CMV disease and mortality:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One early study demonstrated that CMV DNA load was an independent marker of CMV disease and survival and was more predictive than HIV-1 RNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In addition, patients who attained CMV viral suppression with pre-emptive oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> therapy had a significantly lower risk of developing CMV disease and higher rates of survival.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large study of 619 AIDS patients, a positive plasma CMV DNA PCR was associated with a 2.5-fold increased risk of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Furthermore, each log(10) increase in baseline CMV DNA load was associated with a threefold increase in CMV disease and a twofold increase in mortality. However, 14 percent of individuals without detectable plasma CMV DNA at entry developed CMV end-organ disease as well.</p><p/><p>However, the rate of CMV end-organ disease is lower in patients receiving combination ART. As an example, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial was performed in 338 patients with advanced AIDS, most of whom were taking ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Patients had serial measurements of CMV DNA by PCR and indirect ophthalmoscopy every eight weeks. Those with onset of CMV viremia were randomly assigned to either induction or maintenance doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a> or placebo.

Lesions close to or involving the fovea or optic nerve are particularly likely to cause serious visual impairment. Acute loss of vision can occur if retinitis leads to retinal detachment.</p><p>CMV retinitis usually occurs as unilateral disease, but in the absence of therapy, involvement of the contralateral eye will often occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retinal detachment is one of the major causes of vision loss in patients with CMV retinitis. Although the retina can be reattached anatomically by surgery, postoperative visual acuity is almost never as good as it was before detachment occurred. Peripheral (ie, anterior) retinal lesions underlie the vitreous base, where the vitreous body is normally adherent to the retina.

In the absence of antiretroviral therapy, CMV retinitis is associated with little inflammation of the vitreous; retinitis invariably progresses without treatment, usually within 10 to 21 days after presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Lesions can be described as &quot;fulminant and edematous&quot; versus &quot;indolent and granular&quot; based on several factors, including the degree of retinal opacity (whitening), retinal hemorrhage, and lesion shape and location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. One retrospective observational study of 100 AIDS patients with untreated CMV retinitis suggested that lesion opacity may be a surrogate of disease severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The intensity of the white opaque borders is thought to represent virus activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Small lesions may be difficult to differentiate from benign cotton wool spots; as a result, serial funduscopic examinations are sometimes required to make the diagnosis. The rate of enlargement of CMV lesions toward the fovea is slow but gradual. It is therefore safe to perform frequent examinations to confirm uncertain diagnoses before initiating therapy.</p><p>CMV viremia detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), antigen assays, or blood culture are <strong>not</strong> used to make a diagnosis of CMV retinitis or any other CMV end-organ disease in HIV-infected patients given the poor sensitivity and specificity of these tests for determining end-organ disease. As an example, in a study of patients with advanced AIDS and CMV viremia detected by PCR, fewer than 50 percent developed CMV end-organ disease at one year despite receiving no anti-CMV therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Conversely, using the above methods for viral detection, CMV viremia is detected in less than half of patients with active retinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p>Similarly, the presence of CMV antibodies is typically not useful in diagnosing CMV retinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A negative IgG CMV antibody indicates that CMV is unlikely to be the etiology of retinitis. However, on rare occasion a patient with advanced HIV and prior CMV infection may serorevert from antibody-positive to antibody-negative. Thus, a negative CMV IgG antibody significantly lowers the diagnostic possibility of CMV, but does not completely eliminate it from consideration.</p><p>The clinical syndrome of immune recovery uveitis may present with similar symptoms as the initial episode of CMV retinitis, but can be distinguished by a full ophthalmologic examination. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'CMV immune recovery uveitis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">CMV IMMUNE RECOVERY UVEITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After an initial period of treatment with anti-CMV therapy and antiretroviral therapy (ART), patients may develop significant intraocular inflammation secondary to immune recovery. This entity is known as immune recovery uveitis (IRU) and can lead to significant ocular morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/1,23,27,52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,23,27,52-54</a>]. Complications of IRU accounted for approximately 50 percent of incident vision loss among patients with longstanding CMV retinitis and immune recovery in a study published in 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Anecdotally, IRU has rarely been diagnosed over the last decade.</p><p>Uveitis is a general term that refers to inflammation in the eye; vitritis refers to inflammation within the vitreous cavity and is a subset of uveitis. Immune recovery uveitis is associated with vitreous inflammation with or without cystoid macular edema, epiretinal membrane, or retinal neovascularization in patients with ART-mediated immune recovery and inactive CMV retinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/1,56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,56-58</a>]. Although some patients develop transient vitritis soon after initiating ART and quickly recover normal visual function, IRU that leads to macular edema can often be associated with a significant decline in visual acuity despite successful treatment of CMV retinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/23,58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,58-60</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of IRU is not well understood, but may be related to T-cell mediated immune reconstitution to latent CMV intraocular antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/27,52,58,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,52,58,61</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome&quot;</a>.) Symptoms include floaters, blurred vision, or photophobia. Patients may also develop other inflammatory complications such as cataract, glaucoma, and vitreous hemorrhage; neovascularization can occur as a late complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/52,57,62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,57,62,63</a>]. In a study of 54 patients with CMV retinitis conducted early in the modern ART era, the onset of IRU occurred within 2 to 84 weeks (median 20 weeks) after an improvement of CD4 cell counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>In a subsequent study of 374 patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis affecting 539 eyes, 36 patients (9.6 percent) developed IRU involving 50 eyes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Risk factors included prior CMV involvement of greater than 25 percent of the retina, involvement of the posterior pole of the eye, or treatment with intravitreal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cidofovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cidofovir</a>. No patient with IRU was observed to have active retinitis or detectable CMV DNA in peripheral blood. The extent of prior CMV retinitis and the use of either systemic or intravitreal cidofovir has been identified as a potential cofactor in IRU in other studies as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aids-related-cytomegalovirus-retinitis/abstract/53,58,64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,58,64,65</a>].</p><p>Any patient with a history of immune recovery, quiescent CMV retinitis, and new visual symptoms, should be referred promptly for ophthalmic examination to evaluate for CMV progression, relapse, or immune recovery uveitis. On ophthalmologic examination, IRU is characterized by inflammation in the anterior chamber and vitreous cavity, which is best diagnosed with a combination of slit lamp examination and indirect ophthalmoscopy.</p><p>The treatment of IRU is discussed elsewhere.
