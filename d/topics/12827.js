The primary tenets of palliative care are symptom management; establishing goals of care that are in keeping with the patient&rsquo;s values and preferences; consistent and sustained communication between the patient and all those involved in his or her care; psychosocial, spiritual, and practical support, both to patients and their family caregivers; and coordination across sites of care.</p><p>Hospice and Palliative Medicine is a recognized medical subspecialty in the United States and internationally, including in Canada, England, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Many European countries are also in the process of developing certification for palliative care. Unfortunately, in other parts of the world, access to quality palliative care is very limited. Only 14 percent of the needy have access to palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This may be changing. The 2014 World Health Assembly passed a resolution appealing to member countries to incorporate palliative care services into the mainstream health care system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. At the global policy level, in addition to this, two more important developments bear mention. First, in 2000, palliative care was included in the United Nation&rsquo;s International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, which states: &ldquo;States are under the obligation to respect the right to health by, inter alia, refraining from denying or limiting equal access for all persons&hellip;to preventive, curative, and palliative health services.&rdquo; Second, essential medicines for palliative care were included in the 18<sup>th</sup> World Health Organization essential medicines list in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss palliative care and hospice services outside of the United States. A more comprehensive overview of palliative care is available separately.

Globally, it is estimated that 40 million people are in need of palliative care at any point of time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; 39 percent have cardiovascular disease, 34 percent have cancer, 10 percent have chronic respiratory conditions, 6 percent have HIV, and 5 percent have diabetes. Adults in need of palliative care for progressive nonmalignant disease represent the highest proportion of cases for all regions, followed by cancer. One exception to this is in Africa, where people with <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> are the largest group of patients in need of palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the great majority (78 percent) of adults in need of end of life care live in low- and middle-income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Similarly, the vast majority of children (98 percent) in need of palliative care at the end of life live in low- and middle-income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, the highest rates of palliative care availability and utilization among adults are in higher-income countries. Only 9 percent of the world&rsquo;s countries, all of relatively high income, are considered to have advanced levels of palliative care integration into mainstream health services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>One study, which included over 230 countries, evaluated the availability of palliative care internationally and reported that 58 percent had one or more palliative care systems available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Separate studies indicate that specialist-level palliative care is available in only approximately 30 to 45 percent of nations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>Of greater concern, up to 83 percent of the world&rsquo;s population lives in countries with limited or nonexistent access to opioid medicines that are essential for pain relief in advanced diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Faith-based hospices were in existence in Europe and in Pondicherry, India (a French colony at that time), much before the establishment of modern hospices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the United Kingdom, St. Christopher&rsquo;s Hospice was the first modern hospice, which opened its doors in 1967 and, with its focuses on both patient care and research, became a major stimulus for hospices and hospital-based palliative care services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The term &ldquo;palliative care&rdquo; was coined in 1974 by Balfour Mount in Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and became the term of choice internationally for the movement. In the 1980s, palliative care in the United Kingdom established a medical association and a scientific journal, was recognized as a medical specialty, and expanded services countrywide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Palliative care services were initiated in most of the Western European countries (with the exception of the Netherlands) in the 1980s. The first palliative care service in the Netherlands was established in 1991. Expansion of services has been rapid, with the support of the European Association of Palliative Care in the form of research and innovative reports.</p><p>In 2003, the Council of Europe published a set of guidelines on palliative care that described palliative care as an essential and basic right of patients, especially those who have a limited life expectancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This document supports palliative care advocacy for Eastern European countries with less developed systems, where growth has been relatively slow because of differences in the local socioeconomic and health care milieus. According to a 2014 review in the European Association of Palliative Care Atlas of Palliative Care in Europe analyzing all 53 countries that make up the European Region of the World Health Organization (WHO), palliative medicine is now a specialty or subspecialty in 14 countries, and the availability of palliative care has been improving in Eastern Europe, particularly in Moldova, Romania, and Poland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In Scotland, new guidelines designed to improve the care of people with life-limiting illnesses were published in 2015. The guidelines provide practical, evidence-based or best-practice guidance on a range of common clinical issues in palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The Latin American Association of Palliative Care Atlas of Palliative Care in Latin America, published in 2012, gives an analysis of the situation in 19 countries within the region of Latin America and South America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] and notes that there are less than 1000 palliative care services in the region, with homecare teams providing much of them. Argentina and Chile together account for almost half of the total number of services in Latin America, although the best coverage is reported to be in Costa Rica. As such, a wide variability in coverage exists across countries. Four <span class=\"nowrap\">Latin/South</span> American countries (Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, and Chile) offer palliative care accreditation as a medical specialty <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subspecialty, and six offer a course or diploma in palliative care. Graduate level education is also available in other regions, including Paraguay, Cuba, and Uruguay. Paraguay offers postgraduate courses, but no accreditation. In Cuba and Uruguay, all medical schools offer palliative care, either as a separate course program or as part of other course programs.</p><p>With support from the federal government, palliative care services in Australia have steadily increased and have become increasingly available since 1980. Notably, in 2000, palliative medicine was recognized as a specialty within Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], where the world&rsquo;s first professorship in palliative care was also established.</p><p>In Asia, the first hospices were established in Korea (1965) and Japan (1973) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], followed by the first hospice in India in 1986. Development of palliative care in India has been slow except for the southern state of Kerala, which experimented with community-based palliative care services and now accounts for the majority of palliative care services in the country [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In Israel, a rising awareness of the specialty of palliative care has occurred since the late 1970s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Nurse specialists became the key health care professionals in palliative care in Israel in 2009 upon a decision by the Israeli Ministry of Health. This decision was based upon a severe shortage of physicians in Israel, and it lead to augmenting the authority and responsibilities of nurses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The first faith-based palliative care organization in Thailand opened in 1992 at Pharbat Numpu temple in Lop Puri province.

Six countries (Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Swaziland, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe) have standalone palliative care policies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Uganda and Botswana have completed national palliative care policy documents, which are awaiting approval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H989853556\"><span class=\"h1\">HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-income countries have greater integration of palliative care as part of their health care systems, as exemplified in the United States. In addition, many high-income countries provide near-universal access to pediatric palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-services-and-models-of-subspecialty-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits, services, and models of subspecialty palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One study ranked countries (n = 40) on the availability of services using a Quality of Death Index comprised of 27 indices, including expectancy, health care spending as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), public awareness of end of life care, opioid availability, and existence of a national palliative care strategy or agenda [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. As might be expected, high-income countries had greater scores (eg, the United Kingdom scored at the top; South Korea scored in the middle) compared with low-income countries (eg, India).</p><p>However, the coverage and quality of care are not always uniform within a country. As an example, there is widespread geographical variability in specialist palliative care services in the United Kingdom. In 2010 and 2011, the average spending by primary care trusts on specialist palliative care varied from &pound;186 to &pound;6213 (USD $239 to $7981) per death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H989853562\"><span class=\"h1\">LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a significant need for palliative care services among populations in low-income countries. As discussed earlier, nonmalignant conditions (noncommunicable diseases) generally predominate over malignant diseases as the causes of death in these areas. For example, in the African region, <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> and nonmalignant diseases share the same palliative care burden (around 42 percent each of the estimated needy are people with advanced noncommunicable diseases and people with <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1061106168\" class=\"local\">'Common diseases'</a> above.)</p><p>The need for palliative care in the case of cancers is also higher in low-income countries due to late diagnosis, inadequate curative care facilities, and difficulties in access to care. In India, for example, more than 80 percent of cancer patients present with advanced (stage III or IV) disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. It is estimated that annually, 40,000 Kenyans are diagnosed with cancer and more than 27,000 will die from the disease within one to two years of being diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Kenyatta National Hospital, the country&rsquo;s largest and only public cancer treatment facility, currently has only two radiotherapy machines, with more than 1800 patients scheduled for radiotherapy per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Some private hospitals in Nairobi provide both radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but the cost ranges from USD $1600 to $5000, which is prohibitive given that many Kenyans live on only USD $1 per day or less. In addition, many Kenyans live in rural and remote areas, and making the long journey to access these services is challenging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>The issue is even more pressing for children, with estimates that 98 percent of children in need of palliative or end of life care are residing in these countries. Unfortunately, there are almost no pediatric palliative care services available to children in these countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Despite these statistics, palliative care is available and partially integrated into the health care system in several countries, most notably Romania, Uganda, and Costa Rica. Romania has shown rapid progress across the last decade in public policy, education, training, and the establishment of palliative care services. The lead institution for palliative care in Romania is the Hospice Casa Sperantei in Brasov, which was established in collaboration with overseas partners and is now a resource center for palliative care development in Eastern Europe, offering training programs for countries in the Balkan region and Commonwealth of Independent States countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Costa Rica has integrated palliative care into the public health system, achieving a ratio of palliative care services to the general population that is comparable to that in high-income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>A year 2015 report by the Quality of Death Index team demonstrated improvement in palliative care services in some of the lower-income countries, such as Panama (through building palliative care into its primary care services), Mongolia (through rapid growth in hospice facilities and teaching programs), and Uganda (through advances in the availability of opioid medicines). The supply-demand analysis in the same document, based upon the countries&rsquo; demographic profiles and the burden of diseases for which palliative care is necessary, points out that many other developing countries will have to work hard to meet rising future needs as the incidence of noncommunicable disease increases and their populations grow older. The report shows China to be among the most vulnerable from population aging and the rising incidence of conditions such as cardiovascular disease, which accounted for one-third of all deaths in the country in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>In areas where there are no established or state-supported programs, Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> volunteer community health workers have been successfully utilized to provide some palliative care services. Two examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kerala, India &ndash; Homecare services are prioritized over institution-based palliative care, and most services, provided by local self-government organization, are rendered free of charge to patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tanzania &ndash; A project entitled the Continuum of Care for People Living with <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> in Tanzania (CHAT) was initiated in 2006 with support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

In some cultures, talking openly about death and dying is considered disrespectful and can lead to despair and a perception that the process of dying has accelerated. Many people, both in the West and East, find death too distressing to contemplate, and it is, therefore, ignored or avoided. Such attitudes among professionals and the general public can cause delayed or no referrals to palliative care, even in places where good services exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

These included restrictions on types of hospitals and even wards where opioids could be administered, the dose and time interval allowable by a single prescription, and the type of health care provider that could prescribe these agents. Emphasis on prevention of diversion and illicit use of narcotics dating back to the 1961 United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>] unfortunately resulted in such rules and regulations, making it practically impossible to prescribe and dispense opioids for medical use and ultimately denying access to opioids to as many as five billion people in pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administrative barriers &ndash; Even where these agents are available, the process by which patients procure opioids can be a significant barrier, including the paperwork required to prescribe, the cost of agents (often not subsidized by the government), and limits on the dose that can be prescribed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of provider education and empowerment &ndash; There is a lack of education on safe prescription of pain medications worldwide, which may lead to discomfort among providers on how to safely prescribe these drugs.</p><p/><p>Cost of medicines is also an issue.

In Ethiopia, a government-owned company formulates and distributes oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> solution in various concentrations, and a national pain management guideline has been developed. In Jamaica, guidelines have been developed for the safe transportation of opioids from distributors to health care facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, the lack of progress in improving access to opioid medications in most low- and middle-income countries was underscored in a statistical analysis of use and barriers to access of opioid analgesics between 2001 to 2003 and 2011 to 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Worldwide, use of opioid analgesics had increased over this 10-year period, but the increase in consumption was limited to North America, Western and Central Europe, and Oceana (including Australia, New Zealand, and the South Pacific Islands). Countries in other regions, including Africa, Asia, Central America, the Caribbean, South America, and Eastern and Southeastern Europe, showed no substantial increase in use. Their analysis of impediments to use echoed many of the same issues raised by the ESMO working group and included absence of training and awareness in medical professionals, fear of dependence, restricted financial resources, issues in sourcing or importing opioids, cultural attitudes, fear of diversion, international trade controls, and onerous regulation. However, fear of causing dependence and onerous regulations or legislative restrictions as impediments to opioid access were less frequently mentioned in a United Nations global analysis of access to opioids in 2015 as compared with 1995 (fear of dependence 32 versus 64 percent, onerous regulation 18 versus 53 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1061105864\"><span class=\"h2\">Professional education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although more than 120 professional training programs are available globally in palliative care, the vast majority of clinicians still have little or no knowledge of the principles and practices of palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Well-developed specialist training programs for doctors and nurses are available in countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Taiwan, and Canada. Poland, Romania, Slovakia, France, and Germany also have certification programs in palliative care. However, most of the middle- and low-income countries do not have any intermediate or long-term <span class=\"nowrap\">courses/training</span> programs for health care professionals. Latin America is an exception in that one-third of the countries in this region have a postgraduate course or diploma in palliative care. In Africa, governments in Uganda and Kenya have developed professional training programs in collaboration with nongovernmental agencies. Two Asian countries (India and Bangladesh) have started postgraduate degree courses in palliative medicine recognized by their national medical councils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1556722074\"><span class=\"h2\">Status of do not resuscitate documents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Do not resuscitate (DNR) documents are widely in use in hospitals and are accepted in the majority of high-income countries. In Taiwan, for example, the Natural Death Act was passed in 2000, which allows patients over the age of 20 with terminal diseases to express in writing their wish to discontinue medical treatment, and it does not prosecute doctors who allow such deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. It was observed that the rate of DNR orders in terminally ill patients gradually increased in the 10 years (2001 to 2011) following the act [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

For example, in Australia, euthanasia was legalized in the Northern Territory by the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, passed in 1995, but was voided by amendment to the Self-Government Act governing the Northern Territory later in 1996. However, this was subsequently followed by an increase in national funding for palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>In Japan, medical voluntary euthanasia was approved by a high court as early as 1962, but instances are extremely rare, seemingly because of complicated taboos on suicide, dying, and death in the country [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-and-hospice-outside-of-the-united-states/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

One exception is Kerala, India, where more than 60 percent of the funding for palliative care comes from the local government. A few international organizations, such as the Global Fund, the President&rsquo;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the United Kingdom&rsquo;s Department for International Development (DFID), are active in supporting palliative care efforts in low-income countries. PEPFAR, for example, has earmarked 15 percent of its funding for palliative care. Global Fund funding for palliative care has focused largely on HIV and tuberculosis programs. Donations from the United Kingdom and other counties help fund programs in countries such as Romania, Serbia, and Moldova.</p><p>Who pays for the services at the point of care delivery also differs from country to country. In Switzerland, the Netherlands, Ireland, and the United States, patients are required to pay (part of) the service fees directly to the service provider (&ldquo;out-of-pocket&rdquo; payments). Optional supplementary insurance is available to cover additional service costs in the Netherlands and Ireland, but it comes at a higher insurance premium.</p><p>In Germany, patients are required to make out-of-pocket payments for their stay in hospice inpatient units of up to &euro;90 per day when statutory and insurance funding combined are insufficient.
