In areas where malaria is highly endemic, groups at highest risk include young children (6 to 36 months), who can develop severe illness, and pregnant women, who are at risk for anemia and delivering low birthweight newborns. In areas where malaria is transmitted throughout the year, older children and adults develop partial immunity after repeated infections and are at relatively low risk for severe disease.</p><p>Travelers to malarious areas generally have had no previous exposure to malaria parasites or have lost their immunity if they left the endemic area; they are at very high risk for severe disease if infected with <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. For this reason, it is important to consider malaria in all febrile patients with history of travel to malarious areas.</p><p>The clinical manifestations of malaria will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of malaria are discussed in detail separately. (See related topics.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCUBATION PERIOD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following the bite of an infected female <em>Anopheles</em> mosquito, the inoculated sporozoites go to the liver within one to two hours. Individuals are generally asymptomatic for 12 to 35 days but can commence symptoms as early as 7 days (depending on parasite species), until the erythrocytic stage of the parasite life cycle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58397\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58397 \">figure 1</a>). Release of merozoites from infected red cells when they rupture causes fever and the other manifestations of malaria.</p><p>In most cases, the incubation period for <em>P. falciparum</em> infection is about 12 to 14 days (range 7 to 30 days); most infections due to <em>P. falciparum</em> become clinically apparent within one month after exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Longer incubation periods are more likely in semi-immune individuals and individuals taking ineffective malaria prophylaxis.</p><p>The incubation period for relapsing species <em>P. vivax </em>and <em>P. ovale</em> is also about two weeks but illness can occur months after the initial infection due to activation of residual hypnozoites in the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/3,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,7</a>]. Relapses generally occur within two to three years of infection; there is one report of <em>P. vivax</em> infection presenting in a patient four years following departure from an endemic area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The incubation period for <em>P. malariae</em> is about 18 days; however, low-grade asymptomatic infections can very rarely persist for years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53291\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53291 \">table 1</a>). <em>P. falciparum</em> and <em>P. malariae</em> have no dormant (hypnozoite) phase, hence do not relapse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-falciparum-malaria-plasmodium-vivax-plasmodium-ovale-and-plasmodium-malariae\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-falciparum malaria: Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium malariae&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Uncomplicated malaria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malaria should be suspected in patients with any febrile illness if they have had exposure to a region where malaria is endemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/1,2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6</a>]. The initial symptoms of malaria are nonspecific and may also include tachycardia, tachypnea, chills, malaise, fatigue, diaphoresis (sweating), headache, cough, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, arthralgias, and myalgias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. Patients are considered to have uncomplicated malaria in the setting of symptoms of malaria and a positive parasitological test in the absence of signs of severe malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Physical findings may include mild anemia and a palpable spleen. Anemia is common among young children in endemic areas and is often due to multiple causes in addition to malaria (including iron and other nutritional deficiencies as well as intestinal geohelminth infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Mild jaundice may also develop in patients with otherwise uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Splenic enlargement is a frequent finding among otherwise healthy individuals in endemic areas; this condition may reflect repeated malaria infections or infection due to other causes. The spleen often shrinks due to infarctions after multiple malaria exposures, such that it is not palpable. In nonimmune individuals with acute malaria, the spleen may become palpable after several days. In such patients, lack of anemia early in clinical course is common and should not rule out the possibility of malaria.</p><p>Laboratory evaluation may demonstrate parasitemia (usually &lt;5000 <span class=\"nowrap\">parasites/microL</span> of blood, &lt;0.1 percent parasitized red blood cells [RBCs]), anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminases, mild coagulopathy, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-malaria#H4943905\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of malaria&quot;, section on 'Parasite density monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>Uncomplicated malaria can occur with any <em>Plasmodium</em> species. Although falciparum malaria is the most virulent, it is often not possible to determine the species of malaria infection on clinical grounds alone; there are some unique characteristics associated with each species, and <em>P. vivax</em>, <em>P. ovale</em>, <em>P. malariae</em>, and <em>P. knowlesi</em> are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-falciparum-malaria-plasmodium-vivax-plasmodium-ovale-and-plasmodium-malariae\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-falciparum malaria: Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium malariae&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-falciparum-malaria-plasmodium-knowlesi\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-falciparum malaria: Plasmodium knowlesi&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1267653772\"><span class=\"h3\">Fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early in the course of malaria infection, febrile paroxysms occur at irregular intervals each day. The temperature of nonimmune individuals and children may rise above 40&ordm;C and may occur in conjunction with tachycardia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delirium. Febrile convulsions may occur among children in the setting of malaria due to any species. However, generalized seizures are associated with falciparum and may herald the development of cerebral malaria. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Cerebral malaria'</a> below.)</p><p>Later in the course of infection, rupture of infected red cells can become synchronous following concurrent schizont rupture and release of merozoites from erythrocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58397\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58397 \">figure 1</a>). Febrile paroxysms may occur every other day for <em>P. vivax</em>, <em>P. ovale</em>, and <em>P. falciparum</em> and every third day for <em>P. malariae</em>. Paroxysms occurring at regular intervals are more common in the setting of infection due to <em>P. vivax</em> or <em>P. ovale</em> than <em>P. falciparum</em>. With improvements in early diagnosis and treatment, this traditional description of cyclic fever is seen infrequently.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe malaria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Manifestations of severe malaria are summarized in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F107439\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107439 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>].</p><p>Many of the clinical findings are the result of the parasitized (and non-parasitized) RBCs adhering to small blood vessels (&quot;cytoadherence&quot;) causing small infarcts, capillary leakage, and organ dysfunction; these include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/6,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12,13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altered consciousness with or without seizures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory distress or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circulatory collapse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic acidosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal failure, hemoglobinuria (&quot;blackwater fever&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coagulopathy with or without disseminated intravascular coagulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe anemia or massive intravascular hemolysis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoglycemia</p><p/><p>Physical findings may include pallor, petechiae, jaundice, hepatomegaly, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> splenomegaly. Splenic rupture has been described. Diagnostic evaluation may demonstrate the following: parasitemia &ge;4 to 10 percent, anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, elevated transaminases, elevated <span class=\"nowrap\">BUN/creatinine,</span> acidosis, and hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/6,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14,15</a>]. Thrombocytopenia has been associated with increased risk of death from falciparum or vivax malaria, particularly in the setting of concurrent severe anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Although most severe and complicated malaria is usually due to <em>P. falciparum</em>, patients with complicated infection due to <em>P. vivax</em> have also been described. Patients with severe infection due to <em>P. vivax</em> may also manifest pulmonary complications and ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Those at greatest risk for severe disease include nonimmune individuals, immunocompromised patients (including asplenic individuals), children 6 to 36 months of age, and pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/6,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,18</a>]. Increasing parasitemia is associated with increasing disease severity. Semi-immune individuals may have substantial parasitemia with few or no clinical manifestations. However, some severely ill or inadequately treated patients may have a low but rising parasitemia when first seen by a clinician. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-malaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of malaria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Manifestations of complicated malaria can portend a grave prognosis; such patients should receive a prompt and thorough evaluation and immediate treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

The onset may be gradual or sudden following a convulsion. The severity depends on a combination of factors including parasite virulence, host immune response, and time between onset of symptoms and initiation of therapy.</p><p>Risk factors for cerebral malaria include age (children and older adults), pregnancy, poor nutritional status, HIV infection, host genetic susceptibility, and history of splenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. Among adults, cerebral malaria occurs more commonly in nonimmune individuals than in those living in highly endemic areas (where cerebral malaria is more common in children). In a study of 19,560 Kenyan children with malaria, neurologic involvement was observed in 48 percent of cases; presentation included seizures, prostration, impaired consciousness, and agitation (38, 21, 13, and 3 percent of cases, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The mean opening pressure in patients with cerebral malaria is about 16 cm of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Laboratory examination may be normal or may demonstrate slightly elevated total protein level and cell count. In a study comparing CSF findings from 12 children with cerebral malaria and 14 children with presumed viral encephalitis, patients with cerebral malaria had lower white cell count, glucose, and protein levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

A CSF glucose concentration below 3.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (61 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> was the best discriminator of cerebral malaria from presumed viral encephalitis.</p><p>Retinal hemorrhages may be observed in 30 to 40 percent of cases via pupillary dilation and indirect ophthalmoscopy; without pupillary dilation, this finding may be seen in approximately 15 percent of cases. Other funduscopic abnormalities include discrete spots of retinal opacification (30 to 60 percent), papilledema (8 percent among children, rare among adults), cotton wool spots (&lt;5 percent), and decolorization of a retinal vessel or segment of vessel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65241\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65241 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64492\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64492 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50690\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50690 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressure may contribute to a fatal outcome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F100470\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100470 \">picture 4</a>). In one study including 164 children with cerebral malaria, approximately 84 percent of deaths occurred among individuals with evidence of severe brain swelling on magnetic resonance imaging at admission (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F100470\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef100470 \">picture 4</a>); such swelling was noted among 27 percent of survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Signs of cerebral malaria should be evaluated and managed promptly as cerebral malaria can progress rapidly to coma and death. If untreated, cerebral malaria is almost universally fatal; with treatment, mortality is 15 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Among survivors of cerebral malaria, neurologic sequelae are more common among children than adults (about 15 versus 3 percent, respectively). Residual deficits may include hemiplegia, cerebral palsy, cortical blindness, deafness, epilepsy, language deficit, and impaired cognition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Such sequelae are more likely among patients with other grave prognostic indicators including hypoglycemia, acidosis, severe anemia, repeated seizures, and deep coma. Postmalaria neurologic syndrome is an autoimmune encephalitis that manifests within two months of treatment and resolution of cerebral malaria. The condition is rare, presents often with seizures, and responds to parenteral steroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypoglycemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypoglycemia is a common complication of severe malaria, although the usual signs (sweating, tachycardia, neurologic impairment) are difficult to distinguish from systemic symptoms due to severe malaria.

The pathogenesis of renal failure is uncertain but may be related to erythrocyte sequestration interfering with renal microcirculatory flow and metabolism. Other potential factors include hypovolemia and hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Large amounts of hemoglobin and malarial pigments may be present in the urine secondary to intravascular hemolysis. This uncommonly manifests in very dark urine following several attacks of falciparum malaria; mortality is high. Renal impairment can manifest as acute tubular necrosis (both clinically and pathologically), although renal cortical necrosis does not occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (eg, adult respiratory distress syndrome) may be observed in adults with severe falciparum malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The pathogenesis is uncertain but may be related to sequestration of parasitized red cells in the lungs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cytokine-induced leakage from the pulmonary vasculature. This complication may develop even after several days of antimalarial therapy and can be aggravated by overly vigorous administration of intravenous fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

In recrudescence, parasites remain in the bloodstream undetected due to ineffective treatment or host immunological response (or both). In relapse, new hypnozoites are released from liver cells causing another parasitemia. <em>P. falciparum</em> is the usual cause of recrudescent infections, although <em>P. malariae</em> can remain dormant for years; <em>P. vivax</em> and <em>P. ovale</em> may cause relapse months after the primary blood stage infection is cured, as these species have hypnozoite forms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of malaria includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dengue fever &ndash; Dengue fever can cause malaise, headache, fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and muscle aches in association with fever. Myalgia due to dengue fever is usually more severe than myalgia due to malaria. The diagnosis is established with serology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dengue-virus-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dengue virus infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chikungunya &ndash; Chikungunya resembles dengue but is milder and self-limiting, often with a rash. The diagnosis is established via serology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chikungunya-fever#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chikungunya fever&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meningitis &ndash; The headache of malaria may be severe, although there is no neck stiffness or photophobia as seen with bacterial or viral meningitis. Malaria is not associated with a rash (unlike meningococcal septicemia). The diagnosis of bacterial meningitis is established via lumbar puncture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumonia &ndash; Clinical manifestations of pneumonia include fever, cough, dyspnea, and sputum production. Patients with pneumonia may have intercostal retractions and other signs of labored breathing. The diagnosis is of pneumonia established via chest radiography and sputum culture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sepsis due to bacteremia &ndash; Sepsis due to bacteremia may present with fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status; diagnosis requires blood culture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typhoid fever &ndash; Clinical manifestations of typhoid fever include fever, bradycardia, abdominal pain, and rash. The diagnosis is established by stool <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood culture.

Myalgia due to leptospirosis is usually more severe than in malaria; leptospirosis may also be associated with petechial hemorrhages in the skin or mucous membranes. The diagnosis is established by serologic testing.

Older children and adults develop partial immunity after repeated infection and are at relatively low risk for severe disease. As disease incidence wanes, older age groups will become more susceptible due to decreasing immunity. Travelers to areas where malaria is endemic generally have no previous exposure to malaria parasites and are at very high risk for severe disease if infected with <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incubation period for <em>P. falciparum</em> infection is usually 12 to 14 days (range 7 to 30 days). Longer incubation periods are more likely in semi-immune individuals and individuals taking inadequate malaria prophylaxis at the time of infection. The relapsing malarias (<em>P. vivax</em> and <em>P. ovale</em>) can cause clinical illness several weeks or months after the initial infection due to presence of hypnozoites in the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-malaria-in-nonpregnant-adults-and-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Incubation period'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malaria should be suspected in patients with any febrile illness after exposure to a region where malaria is endemic. The initial symptoms and signs of malaria are nonspecific and may also include tachycardia, tachypnea, chills, malaise, fatigue, diaphoresis (sweating), headache, cough, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, arthralgias, and myalgias. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Uncomplicated malaria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Criteria for diagnosis of severe malaria are summarized in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F107439\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107439 \">table 2</a>). Features of complicated malaria may include cerebral malaria, hypoglycemia, acidosis, renal impairment, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, anemia and other hematologic abnormalities, liver dysfunction, and concomitant infection. These are discussed in detail above. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Severe malaria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common manifestations among children with severe malaria include convulsions, coma, hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, severe anemia, and neurodevelopmental sequelae. Findings observed more frequently among adults than children include severe jaundice, acute renal failure, and acute pulmonary edema. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Children versus adults'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of malaria includes viral infection, meningitis, pneumonia, bacteremia, leptospirosis, typhus, and enteric fever. Malaria can coexist with these entities and with HIV, malnutrition, and intestinal geohelminths.
