Multimodal care generally includes pharmacotherapy and one or more psychosocial interventions. In integrated care, the same clinician or team treats both conditions, while in parallel care the mental disorder and SUD are treated by different clinicians. When integrated treatment is not available, clinicians treating the co-occurring disorders should closely coordinate care. (See <a href=\"#H3412253805\" class=\"local\">'Integrated treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychosocial-interventions-for-co-occurring-schizophrenia-and-substance-use-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychosocial interventions for co-occurring schizophrenia and substance use disorder&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SUDs can exacerbate psychotic symptoms directly through the psychoactive effects of substances, or indirectly by pharmacokinetically lowering antipsychotic plasma levels or by contributing to poor patient adherence to treatment. (See <a href=\"#H625900459\" class=\"local\">'Schizophrenia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend treatment of schizophrenia symptoms, including SUD-induced exacerbations, with an antipsychotic medication rather than other primary medications (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).

Careful monitoring of patients&rsquo; antipsychotic side effects and psychotic symptoms is warranted when their smoking status changes; antipsychotic dose adjustments may be needed. Alcohol use in patients with schizophrenia is also associated with reduced antipsychotic plasma levels; however, these patients generally do not require antipsychotic dose adjustments. (See <a href=\"#H4087631246\" class=\"local\">'Antipsychotic-substance interactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While some clinical trials and secondary data analyses have found antipsychotic drugs to reduce substance use in schizophrenia patients with SUD, the findings have been mixed, the studies have been methodologically limited, and the evidence is insufficient to recommend changes to antipsychotic drug prescribing in these patients. (See <a href=\"#H3777122931\" class=\"local\">'Antipsychotic drugs and SUDs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For schizophrenia patients attempting to stop smoking tobacco, we suggest first-line treatment with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in combination with behaviorally oriented psychosocial treatment rather than other medications (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bupropion</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varenicline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">varenicline</a> are reasonable alternative to NRT in stable patients without suicidal ideation or a history of suicidal behavior. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Schizophrenia patients attempting to stop smoking and those treated with smoking cessation medication should be closely monitored for emerging depression, suicidality, or exacerbation of existing psychiatric or extrapyramidal symptoms.
