The rescue squad, delayed in rush hour traffic, finds the blood glucose level to be 23 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> by capillary finger stick and gives him an ampoule of 50 percent dextrose intravenously. The patient awakens promptly but is left with impaired recent memory and is forced to abandon his graduate studies for several months until his memory returns to normal.</p><p>The immediate threat to this patient with hypoglycemia unawareness is a severe insulin reaction with the potential for serious morbidity and mortality. (Severe hypoglycemia is defined as an event requiring the assistance of another person to administer carbohydrate, inject glucagon, or take other resuscitative actions.) He needs revision of his regimen to achieve optimal metabolic control with marked reduction or elimination of hypoglycemic reactions and reversal of hypoglycemia unawareness.</p><p>Return to the previous choice to try again.
