The clinical presentation of PSGN varies from asymptomatic, microscopic hematuria to the full-blown acute nephritic syndrome, characterized by red to brown urine, proteinuria (which can reach the nephrotic range), edema, hypertension, and acute kidney injury. The prognosis is generally favorable, especially in children, but in some cases, the long-term prognosis is not benign.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, management, course of disease, and prognosis of PSGN will be reviewed here. Evaluation and causes of other glomerular disease in children are discussed separately.

Of the estimated 470,000 new annual cases of PSGN worldwide, 97 percent occur in regions of the world with poor socioeconomic status, with an annual incidence that ranges from 9.5 to 28.5 per 100,000 individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poststreptococcal-glomerulonephritis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>In more developed and industrialized countries, the incidence has continued to decrease from the 1970s to the 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poststreptococcal-glomerulonephritis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Based upon data from the Italian Registry of Renal Biopsies, the estimated annual incidence was 0.3 per 100,000 individuals between 1992 and 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poststreptococcal-glomerulonephritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The reasons may include the easier access to the treatment of streptococcal infections and the widespread presence of fluoride in water, which decreases virulence factors of <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poststreptococcal-glomerulonephritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The risk of PSGN is increased in older patients (greater than 60 years of age) and in children between 5 and 12 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poststreptococcal-glomerulonephritis/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>]. PSGN is uncommon in children less than three years of age. PSGN is twice as frequent in males as in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poststreptococcal-glomerulonephritis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>PSGN can present as a sporadic case or during an epidemic of group A streptococcal (GAS) infection (ie, skin and throat infections) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poststreptococcal-glomerulonephritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The incidence of clinically detectable PSGN in children infected during a GAS epidemic is approximately 5 to 10 percent with pharyngitis and 25 percent with skin infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poststreptococcal-glomerulonephritis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PSGN appears to be caused by glomerular immune complex disease induced by specific nephritogenic strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS).

This proposed mechanism is supported by the finding of neuraminidase activity and free sialic acid levels in plasma of patients with PSGN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poststreptococcal-glomerulonephritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anti-DNA antibodies, anti-C1q antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) may also be found in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poststreptococcal-glomerulonephritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rheumatic factor are detected in two-thirds of patients with PSGN.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Available evidence suggests that the major pathogenetic mechanism is in situ immune complex formation due to deposition of streptococcal nephritogenic antigens within the glomerulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poststreptococcal-glomerulonephritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In animal models of post-infectious glomerulonephritis, injected cationic proteins (histones) but not preformed immune complexes were detected in the subepithelial deposits (humps) from renal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poststreptococcal-glomerulonephritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Nephritogenic antigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two leading candidates for the putative streptococcal antigen(s) responsible for PSGN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poststreptococcal-glomerulonephritis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nephritis-associated plasmin receptor (NAPlr), a glycolytic enzyme, which has glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poststreptococcal-glomerulonephritis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. NAPlr has a plasmin-like activity which may promote a local inflammatory reaction.

However, if there is progressive disease beyond two weeks, persistent hematuria or hypertension beyond four or six weeks, or there is not adequate documentation of an antecedent GAS infection, the following causes of glomerulonephritis (GN) need to be considered. A renal biopsy may be needed to differentiate PSGN from these other disorders:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) &minus; The presentation of MPGN may be indistinguishable initially from PSGN. It typically presents with hematuria, hypertension, proteinuria, and hypocomplementemia, which may follow an upper respiratory infection in some patients. However, patients with MPGN continue to have persistent urinary abnormalities and hypocomplementemia beyond four to six weeks and possibly a further elevation in serum creatinine. In contrast, patients with PSGN typically have resolution of their disease and a return of normal C3 and CH50 levels.

Hypocomplementemia is not observed in patients with IgAV (HSP) and the hypocomplementemia that occurs in lupus nephritis is, as mentioned above, associated with reductions in both C3 and C4, whereas C4 levels are usually normal in PSGN.

A review of three case series of 229 children with PSGN found that approximately 20 percent had an abnormal urinalysis (proteinuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hematuria), but almost all (92 to 99 percent) had normal or only modestly reduced renal function 5 to 18 years after presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poststreptococcal-glomerulonephritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>However, the long-term prognosis of PSGN is not always benign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poststreptococcal-glomerulonephritis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Some patients, particularly adults, develop hypertension, recurrent proteinuria (with a relatively normal urine sediment), and renal insufficiency as long as 10 to 40 years after the initial illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poststreptococcal-glomerulonephritis/abstract/53-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-56</a>]. A study from Australia involved 200 Aboriginal children who had had at least one episode of PSGN, with 27 having had multiple episodes. In this cohort, all PSGN episodes were associated with group A streptococcal (GAS) skin infections, often related to scabies. Five years or later, these patients were three to four times more likely to have significant albuminuria compared with people without a previous history of PSGN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poststreptococcal-glomerulonephritis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>These late renal complications are associated with glomerulosclerosis on renal biopsy, which is thought to be hemodynamically mediated. According to this hypothesis, some glomeruli are irreversibly damaged during the acute episode and compensatory hyperfiltration in the remaining glomeruli maintains a relatively normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR). However, this adaptive response results in increases in glomerular pressure and size, both of which may then contribute to nonimmunologic glomerular injury and progressive renal dysfunction. It is possible that, in those patients who develop glomerulosclerosis, renal damage can be prevented or ameliorated by antihypertensive therapy (preferentially with an angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor).

It primarily occurs in the developing world. The risk of PSGN is greatest in children between 5 and 12 years of age, and in older adults greater than 60 years of age. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PSGN is caused by glomerular immune complex disease induced by specific nephritogenic strains of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS). The two leading candidates for nephritogenic antigens are nephritis-associated plasmin receptor and streptococcal pyogenic exotoxin B. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The characteristic pathologic features of PSGN are demonstrated by electron microscopy (dome-shaped subepithelial deposits) and immunofluorescence (deposition of immunoglobulin G [IgG] and C3 in a diffuse granular pattern in the mesangium and glomerular capillary walls) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F76739\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76739 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56846\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56846 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51022\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51022 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F93170\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93170 \">picture 2</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory findings include an abnormal urinalysis (dysmorphic red blood cells, varying degrees of proteinuria, red blood cell casts, and pyuria), positive serology for antibodies to streptococcal antigens, and hypocomplementemia.

(See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although several glomerulonephritides (eg, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and immunoglobulin A [IgA] nephropathy) have similar presentations to PSGN, specific clinical differences usually can differentiate among them. In cases where the diagnosis is uncertain, a renal biopsy may be needed to identify the specific renal disease.
