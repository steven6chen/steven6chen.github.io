Clinical manifestations of tuberculosis (TB) include primary TB, reactivation TB, laryngeal TB, endobronchial TB, lower lung field TB infection, and tuberculoma. Pulmonary complications of TB can include hemoptysis, pneumothorax, bronchiectasis, extensive pulmonary destruction, malignancy, and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and evaluation of pulmonary TB will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations of pulmonary TB in children and HIV-infected patients are discussed separately, as are the epidemiology, pathogenesis, laboratory diagnosis, and treatment of pulmonary TB. Extrapulmonary and miliary TB are also discussed separately.

Primary TB was considered to be mainly a disease of childhood until the introduction of effective chemotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a> in the 1950s. Many studies since that time have shown an increased frequency in the acquisition of TB in adolescents and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of primary TB was well described in a prospective study of 517 new tuberculin converters living on the Faroe Islands off the coast of Norway from 1932 to 1946 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The study included 331 adults and 186 children; all were followed for more than five years. The clinical manifestations of primary TB varied substantially in this population, and symptoms and signs referable to the lungs were present in approximately one-third of patients. Fever was the most common symptom, occurring in 70 percent of 232 patients in whom fever was not a condition for enrollment in the study. The fever onset was generally gradual and low grade but could be as high as 39&deg;C (102.2&deg;F) and lasted for an average of 14 to 21 days. Fever resolved in 98 percent of patients by 10 weeks.</p><p>Fever was not usually accompanied by other symptoms, although approximately 25 percent of patients developed pleuritic or retrosternal pain. One-half of patients with pleuritic chest pain had evidence of a pleural effusion. Retrosternal and dull interscapular pain were ascribed to enlarged bronchial lymph nodes and sometimes worsened with swallowing. Rarer symptoms included fatigue, cough, arthralgia, and pharyngitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculous-pleural-effusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculous pleural effusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiographic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In primary pulmonary TB, the chest radiograph is often normal. In one series including 517 patents with recent skin test conversion, chest radiograph findings were notable for the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hilar adenopathy was the most common finding, occurring in 65 percent of cases. Hilar changes were visible early as one week after skin test conversion, and within two months in all cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pleural effusions developed in approximately one-third of patients, typically within the first three to four months after infection but occasionally as late as one year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary infiltrates were observed in 27 percent of patients; in general, they resolved slowly, over months to years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Perihilar and right-sided infiltrates were the most common, and ipsilateral hilar enlargement was the rule.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Contralateral hilar changes sometimes were present; only 2 percent of patients had bilateral infiltrates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lower and upper lobe infiltrates were observed in 33 and 13 percent of patients, respectively; 43 percent of adults with infiltrates also had effusions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The infiltrates progressed within the first year after skin test conversion in 20 patients (15 percent of cases), reflecting progressive primary TB. The majority of these patients had progression of disease at the original site; four developed cavitation.</p><p/><p>Other studies that provide insight into the clinical manifestations of TB have focused retrospectively upon patients with culture-proven TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. In one series from Canada, 188 patients were assessed, all of whom were culture positive and had abnormal chest radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Thirty patients (18 percent) were classified clinically as having primary TB. The most common finding was hilar lymphadenopathy, present in 67 percent. Right middle lobe collapse may complicate the adenopathy but usually resolves with therapy.</p><p>Several factors probably favor involvement of the right middle lobe: it is more densely surrounded by lymph nodes, it has a relatively longer length and smaller internal caliber, and it has a sharper branching angle.</p><p>In this retrospective series, pleural effusions were present in 33 percent and were the sole abnormality in 23 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Pulmonary infiltrates were present in 63 percent of patients, and 85 percent of infiltrates were in the mid- to lower lung fields. Two patients had cavitation and two others had evidence of endobronchial spread.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H146930397\"><span class=\"h3\">Natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After primary infection, 90 percent of individuals with intact immunity control further replication of the bacilli, which may then enter a &quot;latent&quot; phase. The remaining 10 percent of individuals develop progressive primary disease with TB pneumonia and expansion of infiltrates at the site of the initial seeding or near the hilum. They also may have hilar lymphadenopathy or present with disease at more distant sites, commonly with cervical lymphadenopathy, meningitis, pericarditis, or miliary dissemination. Progression to local pulmonary disease or dissemination occurs more frequently in those with poor immune responses, such as in those with HIV infection, chronic kidney failure, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, and in those receiving immunosuppressive medications (including transplant recipients), young children (before the age of 5), and older adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis#H13826069\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculosis: Natural history, microbiology, and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Natural history of infection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Reactivation tuberculosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple terms have been used to describe reactivation TB: chronic TB, postprimary disease, recrudescent TB, endogenous reinfection, and adult-type progressive TB. Reactivation TB represents 90 percent of adult cases among HIV-uninfected individuals and results from reactivation of a previous focus of mycobacterial containment that was seeded at the time of the primary infection. The apical posterior segments of the upper lobes or the superior segment of the lower lobe of the lung are frequently involved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54832\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54832 \">image 1</a>). The reason for this is uncertain; relatively poor lymphatic flow in the apices may be associated with poor organism clearance. It has also been suggested that <em>M. tuberculosis</em> organisms prefer the higher oxygen tensions in the apical area of the lungs, although TB may not be an obligate aerobe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The original site of infection may have been previously visible as a small scar called a Simon focus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reactivation TB may remain undiagnosed and potentially infectious for two to three years or longer, with development of symptoms only late in the course of the disease. The symptoms of reactivation TB have been described retrospectively, mainly in case series of hospitalized patients in single institutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In these series, symptoms typically began insidiously and were present for weeks or months before the diagnosis was made. One-half to two-thirds of patients developed cough, weight loss, and fatigue. Fever and night sweats or night sweats alone were present in approximately one-half. Chest pain and dyspnea each were reported in approximately one-third of patients and hemoptysis in approximately one-quarter. Many patients had vague or nonspecific symptoms; almost one-third of patients had pulmonary TB diagnosed after an admission for unrelated complaints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever is usually low grade at onset but becomes marked with progression of disease. It is classically diurnal, with an afebrile period early in the morning and a gradually rising temperature throughout the day, reaching a peak in the late afternoon or evening. Fever subsides during sleep, but night sweats may occur. Fever and night sweats are more common among patients with advanced pulmonary TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough may be absent or mild initially and may be nonproductive or productive of only scant sputum. Initially, it may be present only in the morning, when accumulated secretions during sleep are expectorated. As the disease progresses, cough becomes more continuous throughout the day and productive of yellow or yellow-green and occasionally blood-streaked sputum, which is rarely foul smelling. Symptomatic individuals are more likely to have smear-positive sputum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Frank hemoptysis, due to caseous sloughing or endobronchial erosion, typically occurs later in the disease and is rarely massive. Nocturnal coughing is associated with advanced disease, often with cavitation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspnea can occur in the setting of extensive parenchymal involvement, pleural effusions, or a pneumothorax. Pleuritic chest pain is not common but, when present, signifies inflammation abutting or invading the pleura, with or without an effusion. Rarely, this can progress to frank empyema.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of treatment, patients may present with painful ulcers of the mouth, tongue, larynx, or gastrointestinal tract due to chronic expectoration and swallowing of highly infectious secretions; these findings are rare in the setting of antituberculous therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anorexia, wasting (consumption), and malaise are common features of advanced disease and may be the only presenting features in some patients.</p><p/><p>Ambulatory patients with active TB typically have milder and less specific symptoms than hospitalized patients. In a study including 313 TB cases identified among ambulatory patients, cough &gt;2 weeks was observed among 52 percent of patients with pulmonary disease; fever &gt;2 weeks was observed among 29 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, clinical symptoms were observed less frequently among patients of Asian ethnicity than among other patients.</p><p>Other comorbidities may affect the presentation of reactivation TB; these include diabetes, administration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors and advanced HIV infection. Such patients present with more symptoms and a higher proportion of smear positivity, cavitation, treatment failure, and non-TB deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha-inhibitors-and-mycobacterial-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors and mycobacterial infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Presentation in older adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In nonendemic countries, the incidence of pulmonary TB is two to three times higher among older adults, especially those in old age homes, and the risk of death is higher compared with younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Comparative studies have suggested some differences in the manifestations of pulmonary TB between older and younger patients. A meta-analysis including 12 studies noted no significant differences between patients &gt;60 years and patients &lt;60 years with respect to time to diagnosis, prevalence of cough, sputum production, weight loss, or <span class=\"nowrap\">fatigue/malaise</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Findings observed less commonly among older adults included fever, sweats, hemoptysis, cavitary disease, and a positive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a>, but they were likely to present with the nonspecific symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue. Findings observed more frequently among older adults included hypoalbuminemia, leukopenia, and underlying disorders such as cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, malignancy, and gastrectomy. Cavitary disease is less common, and multilobar and lower lobe involvement more common. Because of comorbidities such as COPD and the nonspecificity of symptoms, the diagnosis in older adults can be delayed or missed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical findings of pulmonary TB are not specific and usually are absent in mild or moderate disease. Dullness with decreased fremitus may indicate pleural thickening or effusion. Crackles may be present throughout inspiration or may be heard only after a short cough (posttussive crackles). When large areas of the lung are involved, signs of consolidation associated with open bronchi, such as whispered pectoriloquy or tubular breath sounds, may be heard. Distant hollow breath sounds over cavities are called amphoric, after the sound made by blowing across the mouth of jars used in antiquity (amphorae). Extrapulmonary signs include clubbing and findings localized to other sites of involvement.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Routine hematology and biochemistry laboratory studies are frequently normal in the setting of pulmonary TB. The C-reactive protein (CRP) can be elevated in up to 85 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Late in the disease, hematologic changes may include normocytic anemia, leukocytosis, or, more rarely, monocytosis. Hyponatremia may be associated with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] or rarely with adrenal insufficiency. Hypoalbuminemia and hypergammaglobulinemia also can occur as late findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiographic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with reactivation TB have abnormalities on chest radiography, even in the absence of respiratory symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/9,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,23</a>]. Reactivation TB typically involves the apical-posterior segments of the upper lobes (80 to 90 percent of patients), followed in frequency by the superior segment of the lower lobes and the anterior segment of the upper lobes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54832\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54832 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62501\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62501 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/9,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,24-26</a>]. In multiple large series of TB among adults, 70 to 87 percent had upper lobe infiltrates typical of reactivation; 19 to 40 percent also had cavities, with visible air-fluid levels in as many as 20 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/9,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,24-26</a>].</p><p>Adults without upper lobe infiltrates have &quot;atypical&quot; radiographic patterns (13 to 30 percent of pulmonary TB cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/4,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,27,28</a>]. These findings include hilar adenopathy (sometimes associated with right middle lobe collapse), infiltrates or cavities in the middle or lower lung zones, pleural effusions, and solitary nodules. These &quot;atypical&quot; findings are more common in the setting of primary TB and probably represent increasing incidence of primary TB rather than &quot;atypical&quot; forms of reactivation TB. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Primary tuberculosis'</a> above.)</p><p>Up to 5 percent of patients with active TB present with upper lobe fibrocalcific changes thought to be indicative of healed primary TB. However, such patients should be evaluated for active TB in the setting of pulmonary symptoms or absence of serial films documenting stability of the lesion.</p><p>A normal chest radiograph is also possible even in active pulmonary TB. As an example, in one Canadian study of 518 patients with culture-proven pulmonary TB, 25 patients (5 percent) had normal chest radiographs; 23 of these patients had pulmonary symptoms at the time of the normal radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In this series conducted over a 10-year period, normal chest radiographs represented less than 1 percent of the radiographs in 1988 to 1989 but increased to 10 percent from 1996 to 1997.</p><p>Computed tomographic (CT) scanning is more sensitive than plain chest radiography for diagnosis, particularly for smaller lesions located in the apex of the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Chest CT is useful in patients with suspected pulmonary TB and normal or nonspecific abnormalities on chest radiograph. CT scans typically demonstrate more lesions than are visible on chest radiograph and are particularly helpful in detecting hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.</p><p>Chest CT may also demonstrate a cavity or apicoposterior infiltrates, cavities, pleural effusions, fibrotic lesions causing distortion of lung parenchyma, elevation of fissures and hila, pleural adhesions, and formation of traction bronchiectasis. High-resolution CT is the imaging technique of choice to detect early bronchogenic spread. The most common findings consist of centrilobular 2 to 4 mm nodules or branching linear lesions representing intrabronchiolar and peribronchiolar caseation necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Radiographic findings in the setting of pulmonary tuberculosis are discussed further separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Endobronchial tuberculosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endobronchial TB is defined as tuberculous disease that involves the tracheobronchial tree. It may develop via direct extension to the bronchi from an adjacent parenchymal focus (usually a cavity) or via spread of organisms to the bronchi via infected sputum. Lesions are more likely to be observed in the main and upper bronchi; in 5 percent of patients, the lower trachea is involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Prior to the availability of antituberculous therapy, endobronchial TB was relatively common in the setting of primary infection and reactivation TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. In a 1943 study in a TB sanatorium in West Virginia, lesions in the tracheobronchial tree were observed in 15 percent of cases via rigid bronchoscopy and in 40 percent of cases at autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Endobronchial disease was observed more frequently among patients with extensive pulmonary TB, particularly cavitary lesions. Upper lung parenchymal or cavitary disease with bronchogenic spread to the lower lung fields was commonly observed, presumably from pooled infected secretions. Endobronchial TB appears to have a preponderance in females in their second and third decades of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>] and in the older adult population (mean age 70 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/5,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,37</a>].</p><p>Since the availability of antituberculous therapy, endobronchial TB has been described in 10 to 40 percent of patients with active pulmonary TB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Some degree of bronchial stenosis is observed in 90 percent of cases of endobronchial TB; early diagnosis and prompt treatment prior to development of fibrosis are important to reduce the likelihood of this complication. Endobronchial disease in patients with primary infection has also been associated with impingement of enlarged lymph nodes on the bronchi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>]. Associated inflammation can lead to endobronchial ulceration or perforation. Other complications of endobronchial TB include obstruction, atelectasis (with or without secondary infection), bronchiectasis, and tracheal stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms include a productive cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, lethargy, fever, and dyspnea. Symptoms may be acute in onset and be confused with bacterial pneumonia, asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], or foreign body aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The clinical manifestations can also be subacute or chronic, resembling bronchogenic carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>A barking cough has been described in approximately two-thirds of patients with endobronchial disease, often accompanied by sputum production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/42-44,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44,47,48</a>]. Rarely, patients develop so-called bronchorrhea, which is production of more than 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> of sputum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In some cases, caseous material from endobronchial lesions or calcific material from extension of calcific nodes into the bronchi is expectorated (known as lithoptysis). Wheezing and hemoptysis may also be observed. Lymph node rupture can be associated with chest pain. The presence of dyspnea may signal obstruction or atelectasis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical findings can include diminished breath sounds, rhonchi, or wheezing.

Many patients with hemoptysis are acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear positive and usually have cavitary disease. Bleeding usually is of small volume, appearing as blood-streaked sputum. Massive hemoptysis is a rare complication since the advent of chemotherapy. Prior to effective chemotherapy, massive hemoptysis accounted for approximately 5 percent of deaths from TB.</p><p>Sources of massive hemoptysis due to TB include the pulmonary artery, bronchial arteries, intercostal arteries, and other vessels supplying the lung. Vascular lesions include pulmonary or bronchial arteritis and thrombosis, bronchial artery dilatation, and Rasmussen aneurysm. &quot;Rasmussen's aneurysm&quot; is a relatively uncommon cause of hemoptysis; it refers to the formation of an aneurysm in the setting of cavitary infection that extends into the adventitia and media of bronchial arteries, resulting in inflammation and thinning of the vessel wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,83</a>].

Other causes include residual bronchiectasis, an aspergilloma or other fungus ball invading or colonizing an old healed cavity, a ruptured broncholith that erodes through a bronchial artery, a carcinoma, or another infectious or inflammatory process.</p><p>Patients with significant hemoptysis should be evaluated promptly to define the source of bleeding and to facilitate immediate intervention. Apart from impending exsanguination (which requires immediate surgical care), bronchial artery embolization is the preferred management approach if feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>].

The causal relationship is not clear but mycobacterial cell wall components may induce production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species, which have been implicated in DNA damage leading to carcinogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. Chronic inflammation may also enhance mutagenesis. In addition, immune suppression and radiation therapy for lung cancer may be associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis.

In one retrospective study including 3485 cases of active TB, the prevalence of VTE was approximately 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>], which is similar to the rate associated with malignancy and approximately 100 times higher than the incidence of VTE among hospitalized patients in general [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-complications-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with primary tuberculosis, clinical manifestations have been observed in approximately one-third of cases. Symptoms include fever and chest pain. Retrosternal pain and dull interscapular pain have been ascribed to enlarged bronchial lymph nodes. The physical exam is generally normal. The most common chest radiograph abnormality in one large series was hilar adenopathy. Other manifestations include pleural effusions and pulmonary infiltrates. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Primary tuberculosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reactivation TB refers to reactivation of a previously dormant focus seeded at the time of the primary infection. The apical posterior segments of the lung are frequently involved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54832\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54832 \">image 1</a>). Typically, symptoms are insidious and may include cough, weight loss, fatigue, fever, night sweats, chest pain, dyspnea, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemoptysis; these findings are observed less frequently among patients &gt;60 years. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Reactivation tuberculosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endobronchial TB may develop via direct extension to the bronchi from an adjacent parenchymal focus (usually a cavity) or via spread of organisms to the bronchi via infected sputum. It can occur in patients with primary TB or reactivation TB and was observed more frequently prior to the antituberculous therapy era. Symptoms may be acute or chronic; a barking cough has been described in approximately two-thirds of patients. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Endobronchial tuberculosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary complications of TB include hemoptysis, pneumothorax, bronchiectasis, extensive pulmonary destruction (including pulmonary gangrene), malignancy, venous thromboembolism, and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Complications of tuberculosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis for pulmonary tuberculosis is broad and includes other causes of chronic infection, inflammatory diseases, and malignancy.
