Although the diaphragmatic defect is surgically correctable, in utero herniation of viscera results in pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension, which are often fatal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EMBRYOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Visceral herniation into the thoracic cavity occurs during the critical period of lung development when the bronchi and pulmonary arteries are undergoing branching, from just after the third week postfertilization through the 16<sup>th</sup> week of gestation. Interference with normal lung development at this time results in decreased bronchiolar branching and loss of pulmonary mass (pulmonary hypoplasia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], as well as truncation and over-muscularization of the pulmonary arterial tree, leading to pulmonary hypertension with structural and functional pulmonary vascular abnormalities after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Abnormal development of the lung also results in a dysfunctional surfactant system late in gestation and after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>] and may cause hypoplasia of ipsilateral cardiac structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of CDH has not been established definitively. The leading theories are that it is due to failure of normal closure of the pleuroperitoneal folds during the 4<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> weeks postfertilization or to genetic or environmental triggers that disrupt differentiation of mesenchymal cells during formation of the diaphragm and other somatic structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p>Familial cases involving autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, and X-linked inheritance patterns have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. However, the vast majority of CDH occurs sporadically, with no identifiable familial link. Even among monozygotic twin pairs, concordance for CDH is rare: in a large CDH registry, there were no concordant cases among the five monozygotic twin pairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Many different genetic defects (eg, aneuploidies, deletions, duplications, translocations) have been identified among sporadic cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. These cases may represent de novo mutational events in genes for normal diaphragmatic development or reflect polygenic or multifactorial inheritance, or both.</p><p>The possibility of an environmental trigger is supported by cases of CDH as a manifestation of vitamin A deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-23</a>] and after exposure to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a>, anticonvulsants, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diaphragmatic defect is usually (95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]) posterolateral (Bochdalek hernia), but may be anterior retrosternal or peristernal (Morgagni hernia), or rarely central.</p><p>Herniation usually occurs on the left (80 to 85 percent); right-sided diaphragmatic hernias occur in only 10 to 15 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Bilateral herniation is uncommon (&lt;2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]). With left sided herniation, the stomach is often involved, while the liver is often involved when the hernia is on the right; however, the liver may herniate even with left sided CDH. Both right and left sided hernias involve bowel. A sac may cover the herniated abdominal contents.</p><p>Pulmonary changes are most severe on the ipsilateral side, but can also occur on the contralateral side. The contralateral side is almost always affected in CDH. Differing degrees of bilateral pulmonary hypoplasia may explain the variation in severity among neonates presenting with respiratory distress and CDH.</p><p>Abnormal pulmonary vascular development and function occur on both sides. The cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed is decreased in the hypoplastic lungs, and the adventitia and media of the pulmonary arterial walls are thickened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Vasoconstriction with altered pulmonary vasoreactivity also contributes to poor pulmonary blood flow. </p><p>Left ventricular mass is also diminished in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diaphragmatic eventration</strong> &mdash; Diaphragmatic eventration refers to elevation of a portion of the diaphragm that is intact, but thinned because of incomplete muscularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The thin and redundant membranous diaphragm resulting from an eventration defect may form a &quot;sac&quot; that contains abdominal contents and is displaced into the thorax. It is likely that eventration and &quot;sac type&quot; CDH diagnoses are often used interchangeably, making it difficult to estimate the frequency of these entities. Although severe diaphragmatic eventration can be associated with pulmonary hypoplasia and respiratory distress during infancy, the presence of a sac is generally associated with a better prognosis than classical CDH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Milder degrees of diaphragmatic eventration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CDH with sac can present later in life with gastrointestinal or mild respiratory symptoms, or without symptoms so that the diagnosis is made incidentally on chest x-ray. In a study to analyze patterns of delayed presentation of CDH, 6 of 15 patients diagnosed after 2 months of age had a hernia sac [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diaphragmatic agenesis</strong> &mdash; Anatomically, diaphragmatic agenesis is the most extreme form of CDH. In 1959, Bingham described absence of the hemidiaphragm (diaphragmatic agenesis) as distinct from the usual posterolateral Bochdalek defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. A study of 48 patients noted significant differences in long-term survival for patients with diaphragmatic agenesis versus classical CDH (survival 29 versus 70 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Patients with absence of the diaphragm also had lower mean Apgar scores, longer period of preoperative stabilization and postoperative respiratory support, and a 100 percent rate of complications.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of CDH is approximately 1 to 4 per 10,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/25,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,35,36</a>]. An analysis of data from 31 population-based European registers over a 29-year period and including over 12 million births reported the prevalence of CDH was 2.3 per 10,000 live births and the prevalence of isolated CDH was 1.6 per 10,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. These figures do not account for terminations of pregnancy and stillbirths, which accounted for 30 percent of all CDH in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Most series have not observed a sex association, although some reported a slightly higher incidence in males. Prevalence does not appear to be associated with maternal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal diagnosis should prompt referral to a tertiary center for confirmation of the diagnosis, assessment of severity and associated anatomic and genetic abnormalities, multidisciplinary counseling about options and prognosis, and planning further management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Management may be expectant with prenatal referral to a center with expertise in caring for these infants, termination of pregnancy, or fetal intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal diagnosis is based upon ultrasound examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. There is a wide range in reported sensitivity of ultrasound in detection of CDH. Sensitivity is higher when there are associated abnormalities, with advancing gestation, and when experienced fetal ultrasonographers are performing the examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The mean gestational age at diagnosis is about 24 weeks.</p><p>Left sided CDH is characterized by the presence of a heterogeneous mass in the chest that often results in right mediastinal shift. The fluid filled stomach may be identified in the chest cavity next to or just behind the heart, and noted to be absent in the abdomen, but the stomach is not always displaced into the chest. Peristalsis of bowel in the chest helps to distinguish CDH from an intrathoracic mass, such as cystic adenomatoid malformation (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). Fluid in the small bowel also helps to distinguish bowel from lung or other thoracic neoplasm. The liver may be herniated, as well; it appears as a homogeneous mass in the chest at the level of the heart and continuous with the intraabdominal liver. The gallbladder and hepatic or umbilical veins may be abnormally located within the abdomen, which can be scaphoid.</p><p>Right sided CDH is characterized by the presence of a homogeneous mass (liver) in the right chest that often results in left mediastinal shift. Pleural fluid is often present, and bowel may herniate, as well. The left shift of the heart is a key finding since sonographically the liver is similar in appearance to fetal lung, and bowel peristalsis may not be observed. Identifying the gallbladder in the chest is also diagnostic of right sided CDH.</p><p>Color Doppler ultrasound can be used to document the location of the liver by demonstrating the course of the intrahepatic vessels.</p><p>Polyhydramnios may be present due to esophageal compression. Hydrops fetalis can occur from mediastinal shift and compression of the great vessels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CDH can be an isolated anomaly, part of a syndrome, or nonsyndromic but associated with other abnormalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Isolated CDH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 50 to 70 percent of cases of CDH are isolated ('isolated CDH'). Pulmonary hypoplasia, intestinal malrotation and cardiac dextroposition are due to the hemodynamic or mechanical consequences of CDH, thus they are usually considered part of the CDH sequence and do not negate the designation 'isolated CDH.'</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Complex, nonisolated or syndromic CDH (CDH+)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The other 30 to 50 percent of cases are called 'complex,' 'nonisolated' or 'syndromic' CDH (CDH+) because they are associated with additional abnormalities, including major structural malformations, chromosomal abnormalities, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> single gene disorders. Malformations occur in all major organ systems, with no specific pattern.</p><p>Chromosomal anomalies are identified in 10 to 20 percent of prenatally identified cases; the most common diagnoses include trisomies 18, 13, and 21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/15,38,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,38,40</a>]. Other karyotype abnormalities, such as monosomy X, tetrasomy 12 p (isochromosome 12p), partial trisomy 5, partial trisomy 20, and polyploidies, have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/39,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,41</a>].</p><p>An underlying syndrome is present in approximately 10 percent of CDH cases occurring with associated anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. CDH is a prominent finding in the Fryns phenotype; facial dysmorphology, distal digital hypoplasia, and <span class=\"nowrap\">cardiac/renal/brain</span> anomalies can also occur. CDH and diaphragmatic eventration are also an occasional component of many other syndromes, including Apert, <span class=\"nowrap\">Killian/Teschler-Nicola</span> (Pallister-Killian), CHARGE, Coffin-Siris, Goltz, Perlman, Swyer, Brachmann-Cornelia De Lange, Goldenhar sequence, Beckwith Wiedemann, Simpson-Golabi-Behmel, Donnai-Barrow, Mathew-Wood, Jarcho-Levin, Fraser, Stickler, Pierre Robin, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/25,39,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,39,41</a>].</p><p>Associated anomalies are most common with bilateral CDH and in stillborn infants with CDH, where the prevalence is as high as 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/40,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,42,43</a>]. Anomalies in stillborn infants with CDH primarily consist of neural tube defects (anencephaly, myelomeningocele, hydrocephalus, and encephaloceles) and cardiac defects (ventriculoseptal defects, vascular rings, and coarctation of the aorta) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Other midline developmental anomalies have also been reported, and include esophageal atresia, omphalocele, and cleft palate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other thoracic lesions which should be considered in differential diagnosis include congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM), bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS), bronchopulmonary foregut malformation, bronchogenic cysts, bronchial atresia, enteric cysts, and teratomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (Please see the individual topic reviews on these conditions).</p><p>As discussed above, the definitive sonographic diagnosis of fetal CDH relies on the visualization of abdominal organs in the fetal chest (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound findings'</a> above). The sonographic hallmark of a left CDH is a fluid-filled stomach just behind the left atrium and ventricle in the lower thorax as seen on a transverse view. Other sonographic features that imply the presence of left CDH include the absence of the stomach below the diaphragm, mediastinal shift to the right and a small abdominal circumference. Right CDH is more frequently missed or misdiagnosed because the herniated viscera consists predominantly of the right lobe of the liver, which may have similar echogenicity to the lung, or be confused with a solid mass in the chest such as a CCAM or BPS.</p><p>Cystic lesions in the chest are more likely to be CCAM or foregut duplication cysts than CDH. The presence of a systemic feeding vessel to a cystic or solid mass is consistent with a hybrid lesion or BPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>In few instances, BPS and CDH are both present. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) delineates liver position, and helps in distinguishing the relationship of the diaphragm to other potential fetal chest lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>CDH should also be distinguished from diaphragmatic eventration (displacement of abdominal contents into the thorax as a result of a congenitally thin, hypoplastic but intact diaphragm). Diaphragmatic eventration is a component of several syndromes (eg, trisomy 18). It is rare and usually has less severe effects on lung development and function than CDH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSTIC FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis for survival of affected infants depends on a number of prenatally assessable factors. Prognosis is worse in the setting of an abnormal chromosomal microarray, severe associated anomalies, right-sided defect, liver herniation, and lower fetal lung volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. The lung area to head circumference ratio (LHR) is more predictive of morbidity than mortality. A large defect is more likely to result in pulmonary hypoplasia and death than a small defect. The size of the defect is not measurable prenatally, so the presence of liver herniation and fetal lung volume measurements serves as a proxy for defect size.</p><p>Several other clinical features initially thought to be related to low likelihood of survival have not been confirmed as consistently reliable prognostic indicators. These features include early gestational age at diagnosis, severe mediastinal shift, polyhydramnios, a small lung-thorax transverse area ratio, left <span class=\"nowrap\">ventricle/right</span> ventricle index, left heart hypoplasia, and the stomach in the chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/49-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver herniation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most reliable prenatal predictor of postnatal survival is absence of liver herniation. A systematic review of studies that used ultrasound or MRI to evaluate outcome of fetuses with liver herniation included 710 fetuses and reported significantly higher survival rate in fetuses without herniation (74 percent versus 45 percent with herniation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. These results were limited by wide variability among studies in the definition of liver herniation and mortality (prenatal versus postnatal) and the use of either ultrasound or MR since ultrasound is more likely than MR to miss small herniations.</p><p>Ultrafast fetal MRI using rapid HASTE technique is the most powerful tool to accurately demonstrate liver herniation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82186\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef82186 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/46,55-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,55-58</a>]. Ultrasound can be useful (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56002\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56002 \">image 2</a>); in particular, color flow Doppler can visualize bowing of the ductus venosus to the left of the midline or coursing of the portal branches or hepatic veins to the lateral segment of the left lobe above the diaphragm; however, ultrasound has not always accurately demonstrated liver herniation in the fetus with left-sided CDH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal lung volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Absolute or relative fetal lung volume appears to be useful for predicting survival, but the optimum equation has not been determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Several small studies have suggested that postnatal survival is poor when fetal lung volume measured by MRI is less than about 30 percent of expected lung volume for gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/52,60-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,60-64</a>], and especially when &lt;15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Lung volume can also be assessed using 3-D sonography, but MRI may be more reliable.

This hypothesis was supported by work in sheep, which showed that if the space occupying abdominal viscera were reduced from the chest cavity, then the lungs would grow and develop normally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p>The initial approach to in utero repair was patch closure of the diaphragmatic defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. In all cases of liver herniation into the chest, the fetuses could not be salvaged due to kinking of the umbilical vein and subsequent fetal demise. The open approach to fetal repair of CDH was abandoned when a clinical trial showed no survival advantage, even in fetuses without liver herniation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p>Fetal tracheal occlusion (TO) is an alternative prenatal therapy which avoids kinking of the umbilical vein, and, more importantly, reverses lung hypoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/76,87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,87,88</a>]. The rationale for this approach is that the dynamics of fetal lung fluid can dramatically affect lung growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/89-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">89-91</a>]. Under normal circumstances, the lungs are net producers of amniotic fluid with lung liquid volume and intratracheal pressure maintained at constant values by fetal laryngeal mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Increasing the egress of lung fluid by fetal tracheostomy, induced oligohydramnios, or recurrent laryngeal nerve or cord transection results in pulmonary hypoplasia. Conversely, prenatal TO obstructs the normal egress of lung fluid during pulmonary development, increasing transpulmonic pressure and resulting in large fluid-filled lungs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74750\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74750 \">figure 1</a>). Multiple studies in animal models support this approach and showed prenatal TO accelerated parenchymal lung growth in normal and hypoplastic lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/93-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">93-95</a>]. Lack of lung expansion two and seven days after TO is a poor prognostic sign and may indicate that the occlusion is inadequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].</p><p>In the first human <span class=\"nowrap\">CDH/TO</span> study, exposure of the fetal head and neck via a hysterotomy was performed to occlude the fetal trachea; this procedure was associated with a 13 percent survival rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. Using a similar open-fetal surgical approach, a subsequent study reported a 33 percent postnatal survival rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. In both studies, predicted mortality approached 100 percent; therefore, surgery improved the predicted outcome. However, lung growth was variable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63970\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63970 \">image 4</a>), postnatal respiratory function was marginal, and infants often required long-term, aggressive ventilatory support. This appears to be due to a diminished number of alveolar epithelial type-II cells after prolonged periods of TO, leading to decreased levels of pulmonary surfactant gene and protein expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-diaphragmatic-hernia-prenatal-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/98-101\" class=\"abstract_t\">98-101</a>].

Antepartum fetal testing (eg, nonstress test, biophysical profile) is performed because these fetuses are at increased risk of fetal demise. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prognosis is worse in the setting of an abnormal chromosomal microarray, severe associated anomalies, right-sided defect, liver herniation, and lower fetal lung volume.
