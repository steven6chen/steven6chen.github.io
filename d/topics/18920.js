Zinc intake is closely related to protein intake; as a result, it is an important component of nutritionally related morbidity worldwide. Symptoms attributable to severe zinc depletion include growth failure, primary hypogonadism, skin disease, impaired taste and smell, and impaired immunity and resistance to infection. Zinc supplementation in populations likely at risk for zinc deficiency appears to have beneficial effects on the incidence and outcome of serious childhood infectious diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ZINC METABOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 10 to 40 percent of dietary zinc is absorbed in the small bowel; absorption is inhibited by the presence of phytates and fiber in the diet that bind to zinc, as well as dietary iron and cadmium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Nonetheless, a randomized trial showed that standard iron supplements did not significantly interfere with zinc absorption or reduce zinc levels in healthy breastfed infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Approximately 0.5 to 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> is secreted in the biliary tract and excreted in the stool.</p><p>Zinc circulates at a concentration of 70 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> with 60 percent loosely bound to albumin and 30 percent tightly bound to macroglobulin. Urinary excretion typically ranges from 0.5 to 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. The primary stores of zinc include the liver and kidney. Most of the body zinc stores are intracellular where zinc is bound to metalloproteins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Zinc is the intrinsic metal component or activating cofactor for more than 70 important enzyme systems, including carbonic anhydrase, the alkaline phosphatases, dehydrogenases, and carboxypeptidases. It is involved in the regulation of nucleoproteins and the activity of various inflammatory cells and plays a role in growth, tissue repair and wound healing, carbohydrate tolerance, and synthesis of testicular hormones.</p><p>Zinc is involved in the immune response and the response to infection. Zinc deficiency is associated with impaired phagocytic function, lymphocyte depletion, decreased immunoglobulin production, a reduction in the <span class=\"nowrap\">T4+/T8+</span> ratio, and decreased interleukin (IL)-2 production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>Emerging evidence suggests that zinc may have specific inhibitory effects on some pathogens. As examples, zinc appears to block the secretory effects of cholera toxin and E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and has direct inhibitory effects on enteropathogenic E. coli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Such effects appear to be due to local rather than systemic effects of the zinc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12503302\"><span class=\"h1\">RECOMMENDED INTAKE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual oral intake of zinc is approximately 4 to 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day;</span> the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) is 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for children ages 9 to 11 years; the RDA for adolescent males and females is 11 and 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51953\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51953 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Primary dietary sources of zinc include animal products such as meat, seafood, and milk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53710\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53710 \">table 2</a>). Ready-to-eat cereal contains the greatest amount of zinc consumed from plant products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Sufficient dietary zinc sources are available in a typical mixed diet, but lacto-ovo-vegetarians need more milk, eggs, grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds to achieve adequate levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

The true prevalence of mild zinc deficiency is not known because of the nonspecificity of symptoms and imprecise diagnostic methods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Dietary zinc depletion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Zinc depletion was first described as a consequence of poor intake in adolescent males in Iran and Egypt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The depletion was caused by both inadequate zinc intake and the binding of ingested zinc to fiber and phytates in unleavened bread, and in some cases this was exacerbated by ingestion of clay (eating of earth, a form of pica). Affected patients suffered from severe growth retardation, anemia, hypogonadism, rough skin, and apathy or lethargy. The growth retardation and hypogonadism responded to zinc supplementation.</p><p>Experimental zinc deficiency has been produced in normal volunteers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. They developed primary hypogonadism with decreased serum androgens, increased serum gonadotropins, and oligospermia.</p><p>Inadequate dietary zinc intake and depletion is thought to be an important worldwide health problem affecting poor children in developing countries. Both breast milk and the complementary foods typically offered in developing countries provide inadequate amounts of zinc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The potential significance of this condition has been studied in randomized supplementation trials. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Zinc supplementation'</a> below.)</p><p>Local non-fortified foods may prove to be an important solution to dietary zinc depletion and its health consequences. In particular, the use of meat and liver as a first food for infants may provide a practical solution for infants in developing countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This approach was explored in two studies of healthy breastfed infants in the United States, in which infants were randomized to be fed with either fortified cereal or beef as a first complementary food from age 4 to 7 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Both diets provided estimated requirements of zinc and iron, and there were no differences in infant tolerance or acceptance, or in serum zinc levels. These findings suggest that meat or liver may provide a practical solution to zinc and iron deficiency in developing countries, if social, cultural, and economic barriers to this practice can be addressed by public health initiatives.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Breastfeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptomatic zinc deficiency occurs rarely in exclusively breast-fed infants (usually premature) whose mothers have a low level of zinc in their breast milk. The clinical presentation is similar to that of acrodermatitis enteropathica (see next section) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Acrodermatitis enteropathica</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a recessively inherited partial defect in intestinal zinc absorption. It is the result of mutations in the SLC39A4 gene on chromosome 8q24.3, which encodes a protein that appears to be involved in zinc transportation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Affected infants develop an erythematous and vesiculobullous dermatitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71329\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71329 \">picture 1</a>), alopecia, ophthalmic disorders, diarrhea, severe growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, neuropsychiatric manifestations, and frequent infections. The syndrome is associated with severe zinc depletion and responds to oral supplementation with pharmacologic doses of zinc. Replacement doses of 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> of elemental zinc (13.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-sulfate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">zinc sulfate</a>) are recommended; zinc levels are measured every three to six months and the dose is adjusted up or down as needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reduced zinc levels, at times symptomatic, have been reported in several other conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crohn disease &ndash; Low plasma zinc concentrations occur in a significant number of patients with active Crohn disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The clinical significance of this observation is not known. Several cases of dermatitis resembling acrodermatitis enteropathica with alopecia and eczematous changes responding to zinc administration have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Hypogonadism, growth retardation, and abnormalities in taste also have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Studies have suggested that zinc absorption is significantly reduced in children with Crohn disease, whereas endogenous fecal zinc excretion and urinary zinc excretion are unchanged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This results in much poorer zinc balance in the children with Crohn disease. The long-term consequences of this and the optimum level of zinc supplementation for children with Crohn disease remain unclear.

The dermatitis resembles acrodermatitis enteropathica but may be more widespread and may not respond to zinc supplementation alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Concomitant deficiencies in essential fatty acids or <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/energy</span> malnutrition also may contribute to the dermatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Nutritional issues&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sickle cell disease &ndash; Low zinc levels can occur in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease, particularly in association with poor or delayed growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Zinc depletion in this population appears to reflect increased urinary excretion caused by a renal tubular defect and perhaps chronic hemolysis or impaired absorption, not inadequate dietary intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. In one study, for example, 44 percent of 104 children with sickle cell disease had low plasma zinc concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. These children, when compared to those with normal plasma zinc levels, had significant reductions in height, weight, upper arm muscle area, and, in older children, delayed sexual maturation. Whether zinc deficiency promotes infection in children with sickle cell disease remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver disease &ndash; Children and adults with severe, chronic liver disease have an increased incidence of low plasma zinc levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. The mechanism may be multifactorial, including hypoalbuminemia, reduced intake, and increased urinary excretion. The low plasma concentration and the increased urinary excretion correct within seven days of liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate zinc supplementation in parenteral nutrition &ndash; A case series described three premature infants with cholestasis who developed clinical zinc deficiency consisting of diaper dermatitis, perioral erosions, and bullae on the dorsal surface of the hands and feet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The infants had received prolonged parenteral nutrition with inadequate zinc supplementation due to a nationwide shortage of injectable zinc in 2012. Premature infants have increased needs for zinc because of low body stores and increased requirements for growth (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parenteral-nutrition-in-premature-infants#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parenteral nutrition in premature infants&quot;, section on 'Trace elements'</a>). The shortage of zinc for parenteral administration remains a concern in the United States and elsewhere; clinicians should maintain vigilance in children of all ages receiving parenteral nutrition because of the possibility of zinc deficiency. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal disease &ndash; Zinc deficiency caused by increased urinary excretion can complicate nephrotic syndrome in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In addition, uremic patients are often deficient in zinc, probably because of reduced dietary intake, zinc malabsorption, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> possible leaching of zinc by dialysis equipment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adolescent athletes &ndash; One study found significantly low plasma zinc concentrations in adolescent gymnasts when compared to matched control sedentary children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. This finding probably is related to inadequate intake associated with overall dietary restrictions caused by a desire to maintain weight as well as possibly increased losses in sweat. Other studies have not found reduced zinc levels in adolescent athletes with normal zinc intakes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous signs and symptoms have been associated with zinc depletion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55126\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55126 \">table 3</a>). Mild zinc deficiency is associated with depressed immunity, impaired taste and smell, onset of night blindness, and decreased spermatogenesis. Severe zinc deficiency is characterized by severely depressed immune function, frequent infections, bullous pustular dermatitis, diarrhea, and alopecia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59027\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59027 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/3,4,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,50</a>].</p><p>In some situations, zinc depletion is documented by measurement of zinc concentration in plasma, lymphocytes, or neutrophils. Because zinc is a cofactor for alkaline phosphatase activity, alkaline phosphatase serves as a serologic marker for zinc depletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In other situations, the diagnosis of zinc depletion is inferred by the response to zinc supplementation in placebo-controlled intervention.

Measurement of zinc in the plasma is simple and readily available in many laboratories. A low plasma zinc usually is defined as a value less than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Because most plasma zinc is bound to albumin, measured zinc levels will typically be reduced in patients with hypoalbuminemia. However, in clinical practice, it is not particularly helpful to correct measured zinc levels for hypoalbuminemia, because plasma levels are only loosely correlated with zinc stores, and because zinc replacement is usually provided to patients with low zinc levels, regardless of albumin status, particularly in the context of chronic disease. </p><p>Some investigators argue that plasma zinc measurements are relatively insensitive and that mild zinc deficiency occurs with normal plasma levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Zinc levels in neutrophils or lymphocytes may be more sensitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The criteria for zinc deficiency are decreased zinc level in either lymphocytes (&lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/10<sup>10</sup></span> cells) or granulocytes (&lt;42 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/10<sup>10</sup></span> cells) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Depressed serum alkaline phosphatase levels for age provide supportive evidence for zinc deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H132777961\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For zinc deficiency due to inadequate intake, a typical oral replacement dose is 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> of elemental zinc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. These replacement doses are also appropriate for patients with underlying diseases that predispose to zinc deficiency, such as Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, liver disease, or sickle cell disease. Note that it is acceptable if these short-term replacement doses exceed the upper limit (UL) for zinc, which refer to chronic intake of zinc. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Zinc toxicity'</a> below.). </p><p>Higher replacement doses (approximately 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> of elemental zinc) are used for acrodermatitis enteropathica, to overcome the defect in intestinal zinc absorption.

Zinc supplementation has been evaluated both as a therapeutic agent and as a potential prophylactic agent in children in these populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention of diarrhea and pneumonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous studies in developing countries have shown that routine oral zinc supplementation reduces the incidence of diarrheal disease, diarrhea-related mortality, and pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/58-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-66</a>]. In a meta-analysis, zinc supplementation for three or more months in children younger than 5 years of age reduced episodes of diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, severe diarrhea or dysentery, persistent diarrhea, and lower respiratory tract infections or pneumonias, with rate ratios between 0.75 and 0.95 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The effect size is small and probably enhanced by publication bias, suggesting that it would be helpful to identify subpopulations most likely to benefit from zinc supplementation. Two other meta-analyses that included several of the same trials found that zinc supplementation given to children between two and five years of age in developing countries reduced the incidence of clinically confirmed pneumonia by about 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/64,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,67</a>], and of diarrhea by 13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The doses of elemental zinc used in the studies included in these meta-analyses ranged from 15 to 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span>. A<strong> </strong>randomized trial in Africa found that adjunctive treatment with a multivitamin supplement did not enhance the efficacy of zinc supplementation in preventing diarrheal episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. </p><p>Trials in infants also suggest that zinc supplementation has a small protective effect on the risk for diarrhea and pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/66,69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,69,70</a>]. One placebo controlled study found that two weeks of zinc supplementation to infants aged 6 to 11 months in India reduced the frequency of diarrheal episodes by 39 percent, and duration of the episodes by 36 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. In Brazilian neonates with low birth weight zinc supplementation for the first eight weeks of life reduced the incidence of diarrhea by 48 percent less during their initial 26 weeks of life. In Tanzanian infants, infants supplemented with zinc between 6 weeks and 18 months of age had reductions in diarrhea, dysentery, and upper respiratory infections (decreased by 12, 16, and 8 percent, respectively), regardless of whether a multivitamin supplement was given concurrently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>Of note, there is some evidence that supplementation with a micronutrient powder (with or without zinc) is associated with adverse effects.

In the largest of these trials, 937 Indian children between the ages of 6 and 35 months with acute diarrhea received vitamin supplementation and were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 20 mg of zinc per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Children with malnutrition severe enough to require hospitalization were excluded. Zinc supplementation reduced the duration of diarrhea by 23 percent (95% CI 12-32 percent) and the number of watery stools per day by 39 percent (95% CI 6-70 percent). The reductions in duration and severity were greater in children with growth retardation than in those with normal growth.

The population in the second study was younger (infants &lt;4 months of age) and may have had lesser degrees of malnutrition. In a third randomized trial, zinc given at higher doses (15 mg daily for infants &lt;12 months and 30 mg daily for those &gt;12 months) for 14 days also did not affect copper levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].

All subjects were treated with antibiotics according to a standardized protocol. Infants who were also treated with zinc (5 mg twice daily by mouth) had significantly less treatment failure as compared to those treated with placebo (10 percent versus 17 percent); treatment failure was defined as a need to change antibiotics within seven days of randomization, or a need for intensive care, or death at any time within 21 days. The absolute risk reduction was 6.8 percent (95% CI 1.5-12.0).

The combination of zinc with a multivitamin supplement (without iron) had a small positive effect on weight gain. The authors speculate that zinc supplements were not helpful in this age group because infants had adequate zinc intake through breast milk, and the supplements may have interfered with absorption of other nutrients such as copper and iron. In this population, zinc or multivitamin supplementation had no effect on measures of cognition at 15 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Young children &ndash; A meta-analysis focusing on children younger than five years from resource-limited countries found modest positive effects of zinc on linear growth, but this effect was attenuated in children given concurrent iron supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zinc-deficiency-and-supplementation-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].

Primary dietary sources of zinc include animal products such as meat, seafood, milk and fortified cereal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53710\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53710 \">table 2</a>). Sufficient dietary zinc sources are available in a typical mixed diet, but lacto-ovo-vegetarians need more milk, eggs, grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds to achieve adequate levels.

Both breast milk and the complementary foods typically offered in developing countries provide inadequate amounts of zinc. Symptomatic zinc deficiency occasionally occurs in exclusively breast-fed infants (usually premature) whose mothers have a low level of zinc in their breast milk. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a recessively inherited partial defect in intestinal zinc absorption.
