Unilateral diaphragm paralysis is more common than bilateral disease and may be discovered incidentally on a chest radiograph. Bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis is usually seen in the context of severe generalized muscle weakness. In some cases, however, the diaphragm is the initial or only muscle involved. </p><p>An overview of the different therapies available for the treatment of diaphragmatic paralysis will be presented here. The etiology, assessment, and physiologic effects of unilateral and bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-bilateral-diaphragmatic-paralysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">UNILATERAL PARALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis are asymptomatic and require no treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F63905\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63905 \">image 1</a>). The prognosis is good in this setting, and the paralysis is of little clinical relevance in the absence of new or underlying pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Some patients with unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis complain of dyspnea. This is most likely to occur with the increased ventilatory demands of intense physical activity or the presence of superimposed pulmonary disease. Treatment of the diaphragmatic paralysis may be considered when the dyspnea is disproportionate to the degree of physical activity or to the severity of the lung disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical plication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical plication of the affected hemidiaphragm has provided excellent results in carefully selected patients&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/4-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-12</a>]. This operation is performed using an open, thoracoscopic, or laparoscopic approach and involves creating folds in the diaphragm and suturing them in place to reduce mobility of the paralyzed hemidiaphragm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70441\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70441 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/5,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13,14</a>]. Plication usually results in improvement in lung function, exercise endurance, and dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>]. The likely mechanism is improved function of the healthy hemidiaphragm and of the accessory muscles of inspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before plication, the healthy hemidiaphragm generates negative intrathoracic pressure that is transmitted to the affected side. This pressure pulls up the paralyzed leaflet and with it parts of the abdominal contents. This ineffective motion does not effectively expand the ipsilateral lung and results in poor gas exchange in that portion of the thorax.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After plication, the paralyzed hemidiaphragm resists being pulled up into the thorax when contraction of the functioning hemidiaphragm generates negative pleural pressure. As a result, the abdomen is not pulled upwards, and the adjacent lung segments expand. Plication also improves the abdominal ribcage synchrony bilaterally, resulting in increased ventilation to the well-perfused lung and improves gas exchange [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Furthermore, the healthy hemidiaphragm now performs less work, rendering it less susceptible to fatigue and decreasing the need to recruit accessory muscles of ventilation. Thus, in addition to improving static lung mechanics, plication also enhances exercise performance, blood gas exchange, and respiratory muscle function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103245224\"><span class=\"h2\">Transient ventilatory support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, patients with unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis will develop acute respiratory insufficiency due to an intercurrent respiratory infection, exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or following general anesthesia. These patients may require a few days of ventilatory support with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) or invasive mechanical ventilation, but will usually be able to be weaned from ventilatory support once the intercurrent illness is resolved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in adults&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-management#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Management&quot;, section on 'Acute respiratry failure (short-term use)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-management#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Management&quot;, section on 'Invasive mechanical ventilation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">BILATERAL DIAPHRAGMATIC PARALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis depends upon the etiology and severity of the paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Most patients who have ventilatory failure are treated with ventilatory support (invasive or noninvasive). Diaphragmatic pacing can be used as a means to wean patients from, or delay the need for ventilatory support. The best candidates for diaphragmatic pacing are those with high level spinal cord injury (above the third cervical level). Limited data in a small population of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis who have ventilatory failure due to diaphragmatic weakness have reported that pacing using residual functioning units of the phrenic nerve at the level of the diaphragm is safe; a randomized trial is underway. Patients who have denervated diaphragms cannot be paced. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pacing the diaphragm: Patient selection, evaluation, implantation, and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventilatory support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most forms of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis are associated with progressive ventilatory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>]. Patients may initially present with dyspnea, orthopnea, and normal blood gases. With disease progression, the symptoms worsen, and ventilatory failure with carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) retention becomes apparent. Progressive disease is not necessarily irreversible and nocturnal ventilatory assistance may have a significant beneficial effect. This suggests that fatigue of the overworked accessory muscles may play a role in the development of ventilatory failure in these patients. Typical parameters for initiation of nocturnal ventilatory support include an arterial partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) of 48 mmHg or higher or a maximal inspiratory pressure (PI max) lower (less negative) than -60 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Clinical manifestations and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the initial study demonstrating improvement after ventilatory support, the investigators used intermittent mechanical ventilation with cuirass respirators in patients with overt CO<sub>2</sub> retention and decreased central ventilatory drive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Subsequent reports described patients with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis who presented differently or at an earlier stage. One report, for example, studied patients with a normal arterial PCO<sub>2</sub> but a slightly increased alveolar-arterial gradient for oxygen&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These patients had decreased ventilatory muscle strength, as measured by maximal inspiratory and transdiaphragmatic pressures; these pressures returned toward normal in association with an improved functional score and decreased dyspnea after a period of negative pressure ventilatory assistance.</p><p>The advent of small portable ventilatory units capable of providing assistance with inspiratory as well as expiratory pressure (eg, bilevel positive airway pressure or BPAP) has made noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) easily accessible and relatively well accepted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In our opinion, this is the therapeutic tool of choice for symptomatic patients with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. As patients with ventilatory disorders may have a coexistent sleep related disorder of breathing that would require an alternate therapeutic approach, we typically obtain overnight polysomnography prior to initiating NPPV. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing in patients with neuromuscular and chest wall disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Even patients with cor pulmonale will typically manifest improved function and correction of the arterial blood gases abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/17,18,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,24</a>]. This is usually achieved with nighttime or intermittent daytime noninvasive ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Practical aspects of nocturnal noninvasive ventilation in neuromuscular and chest wall disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous noninvasive ventilatory support for patients with respiratory muscle dysfunction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients who fail nasal, oral, or oronasal BPAP may need further adjustment in the mask fit, prevention of air leakage, a change to a portable volume-limited&nbsp;ventilator, or the use of both nocturnal and daytime NPPV. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Types of noninvasive nocturnal ventilatory support in neuromuscular and chest wall disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Practical aspects of nocturnal noninvasive ventilation in neuromuscular and chest wall disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Endotracheal intubation and tracheostomy with positive pressure intermittent or permanent ventilation are reserved for those patients with life-threatening respiratory insufficiency or those in whom ventilation cannot be sustained in any other way (eg, high quadriplegic). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-tracheostomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of tracheostomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Diaphragmatic pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diaphragmatic pacing can be used in patients with apnea or severe hypoventilation due to bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. </p><p>Phrenic nerve pacing can only be performed in patients with intact phrenic nerve function. Patients with denervated diaphragms cannot be paced. Patients with diaphragmatic paralysis due to high level cervical cord injury are the best candidates for diaphragmatic pacing. The selection of suitable candidates, evaluation, implantation, and complications of diaphragmatic pacing are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pacing-the-diaphragm-patient-selection-evaluation-implantation-and-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pacing the diaphragm: Patient selection, evaluation, implantation, and complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28238499\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical nerve transfer and diaphragmatic pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are ventilator dependent as a result of combined cervical spinal cord injury and phrenic nerve lesions are generally considered to be unsuitable candidates for diaphragmatic pacing due to loss of phrenic nerve integrity. A recent study of 14 such patients who were ventilator dependent, who were treated with simultaneous surgical nerve transfer and diaphragmatic pacing, showed diaphragm electromyographic activity in 13 of the 14 (93 percent) patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Eight of these 13 (62 percent) patients achieved sustainable periods (&gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">hours/day)</span> of ventilator weaning (mean = 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">hours/day</span> [n = 8]). Two patients recovered voluntary control of diaphragmatic activity and regained the capacity for spontaneous respiration. Surgical intervention resulted in a 25 percent reduction (p&lt;0.05) in ventilator dependency. These results are considered preliminary only.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1807067\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiviral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A preliminary study examined the effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> 1000 mg twice daily for 1 week in three consecutive patients with recent onset bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis and found recovery of diaphragmatic function over 4 to 6 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diaphragmatic-paralysis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In contrast, the historical experience with 16 patients included 5 who did not recover function at all and 11 who recovered function, but with a mean time to recovery of 14 months. These results suggest that in patients with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis of acute onset (suggesting a viral etiology) and without another recognizable cause, a one week course of antiviral therapy may be considered. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with asymptomatic unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis do not require treatment. Many patients with mild to moderate dyspnea from unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis will improve spontaneously over the course of one to two years. Those patients with significant and persistent symptoms or important exercise limitation may benefit from ipsilateral surgical diaphragmatic plication (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F70441\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70441 \">figure 1</a>).
