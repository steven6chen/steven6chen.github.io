In an endoscopist-blinded trial, 227 patients were assigned to receive sodium picosulfate either the morning of the colonoscopy (at 7 AM and 10 AM), or starting the day prior to the colonoscopy (at noon, 5 PM, and 8 AM the morning of the colonoscopy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bowel-preparation-before-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Patients who received the same-day preparation had better overall bowel cleansing compared with those who received split-dosing. In the same-day preparation group, bowel cleansing was graded as excellent, average, or poor in 47, 52, and 1.5 percent of patients, respectively. In the patients who received the split-dose preparation, the rates were 50, 40, and 11 percent, respectively.

All of the available preparations can produce adequate cleansing results with acceptable tolerance, though results for individual patients are variable. As a result, none of the regimens has been universally adopted. (See <a href=\"#H2385207334\" class=\"local\">'FDA-approved preparations'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2922505891\" class=\"local\">'Non-FDA approved preparations'</a> below.)</p><p>The choice of preparation for an individual patient will depend on the presence of risk factors for prep-related complications, the patient's preferences regarding the volume of the preparation, prior experience and results with a given preparation, and cost. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1072701059\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One author of this topic (YAR) prefers the PEG-ELS based preparations. Many centers also prefer balanced electrolyte solutions containing polyethylene glycol (PEG-ELS) or PEG-3350 based preparations for all of their patients. This approach allows the center to simplify its instructions (since most patients are receiving the same preparation) and avoids the inadvertent administration of a hyperosmotic preparation to a patient who should not receive one. Administering the preparation as a split-dose is suggested. (See <a href=\"#H148494535\" class=\"local\">'Polyethylene glycol-electrolyte lavage solution'</a> below and <a href=\"#H89128093\" class=\"local\">'Split-dose'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2110154311\"><span class=\"h3\">Alternatives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients under the age of 65 and without history of inadequate preparation or relevant comorbidity (eg, heart failure, renal insufficiency, end stage liver disease, or risk for electrolyte imbalance), one author of this topic (MF) uses split-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium citrate</a> because it is well tolerated and inexpensive. The total volume of magnesium citrate preparation is 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/80</span> oz. Preparations that use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisacodyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bisacodyl</a> are avoided because of the small risk of ischemic colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bowel-preparation-before-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H148493872\" class=\"local\">'Magnesium citrate'</a> below.)</p><p>The alternative approach needs to be modified for special patient populations. (See <a href=\"#H760567930\" class=\"local\">'Special patient populations'</a> below.)</p><p>The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) recommends that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium citrate</a> preparations are not used in older patients, patients with renal disease, or patients who are taking medications that alter renal blood flow or electrolyte excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bowel-preparation-before-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The ASGE also does not recommend magnesium citrate as a routinely used preparation.</p><p>Sodium phosphate-based preparations are avoided because of the potential for serious electrolyte abnormalities and renal complications, even in patients without risk factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2859917698\"><span class=\"h2\">Cost</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cost of the preparations vary widely and may be an issue for patients who lack insurance coverage for the preparation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bowel-preparation-before-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Full-volume (4 L) PEG solutions cost approximately $20 to $35, whereas low-volume PEG solutions, sodium sulfate, and sodium picosulfate cost approximately $75 to $95 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bowel-preparation-before-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].In the United States, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium citrate</a> is available over-the-counter and is often the least expensive option (less than $10). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3008776332\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPROVING TOLERABILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients find that the bowel preparation is unpalatable and difficult to drink. For some patients, the volume of the preparation requiring consumption is a major concern. In these cases, lower-volume preparations and split-dose preparations are better tolerated. Lower-volume preparations include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-citrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium citrate</a>, PEG combined with an additional agent to promote bowel cleansing (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisacodyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bisacodyl</a> or ascorbic acid), sodium sulfate preparations, and sodium picosulfate preparations. High-volume (4 liter) preparations are PEG-ELS-based. (See <a href=\"#H89128093\" class=\"local\">'Split-dose'</a> above and <a href=\"#H696041751\" class=\"local\">'Administration of low volume PEG-ELS'</a> below.)</p><p>We recommend that patients use either the flavor packets (if provided with the preparations) or use a sugar-free powdered flavor enhancer. While sports drinks, sugar-free powdered flavor enhancers, and carbohydrate-electrolyte solutions may improve the taste of PEG solutions, improved flavor does not necessarily mean improved tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bowel-preparation-before-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Furthermore, some additives can alter the osmolarity of the preparation, be metabolized into explosive gases, or alter the amount of water and salts absorbed. </p><p>Additional measures that may make preparations easier to consume include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bowel-preparation-before-colonoscopy-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chilling the solution</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drinking the solution through a straw</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sucking on lemon slices</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sucking on sugar-free menthol candy drops</p><p/><p>Some of these measures can also be used for patients who develop nausea, vomiting, or excessive bloating after starting the preparation. </p><p>Patients who are having difficulty with the preparation can be instructed to temporarily interrupt the regimen (for one to two hours) or slow the rate of consumption.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H760567930\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIAL PATIENT POPULATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific patient characteristics affect the choice of bowel preparation.

All of the available preparations can produce adequate cleansing results with acceptable tolerance, though results for individual patients are variable. As a result, none of the regimens has been universally adopted (see <a href=\"#H2385207334\" class=\"local\">'FDA-approved preparations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2922505891\" class=\"local\">'Non-FDA approved preparations'</a> above). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that bowel preparations are administered in a split-dose rather than being given entirely the evening prior to the colonoscopy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). Split-dosing results in greater efficacy and patient tolerance compared with single dose prep. An acceptable alternative for patients undergoing an afternoon procedure is a single dose, same day preparation. (See <a href=\"#H3538453578\" class=\"local\">'Timing of preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many centers prefer balanced electrolyte solutions containing polyethylene glycol (PEG-ELS) or PEG-3350 based preparations for all of their patients. Administering the preparation as a split-dose is suggested. (See <a href=\"#H1632749169\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperosmotic laxative regimens may lead to volume and electrolyte shifts or may cause mucosal damage. For patients with a history of heart failure, renal insufficiency, end-stage liver disease, or electrolyte abnormalities, or for patients who are being evaluated for inflammatory bowel disease or unexplained chronic diarrhea, we suggest using PEG-ELS preparation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H760567930\" class=\"local\">'Special patient populations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not using preparations that use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bisacodyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bisacodyl</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Bisacodyl has been associated with a small risk of ischemic colitis. (See <a href=\"#H1632749169\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For older adults (&gt;65 years of age), we suggest using a PEG-ELS based preparation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Older adults may be at increased risk for fluid and electrolyte shifts induced by hyperosmotic preparations. (See <a href=\"#H760567930\" class=\"local\">'Special patient populations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sodium phosphate</a> preparations are also available, but are generally avoided because of concerns over their safety. (See <a href=\"#H2385207334\" class=\"local\">'FDA-approved preparations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many patients find that the bowel preparation is unpalatable and difficult to drink. In addition to the split dose preparation, measures that can make the prep more tolerable include using a straw to drink the prep and chilling the prep. (See <a href=\"#H3008776332\" class=\"local\">'Improving tolerability'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For flexible sigmoidoscopy preparation, we suggest that patients under the age of 65 years receive two <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium phosphate</a> enemas if there is no contraindication (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We suggest that patients undergoing flexible sigmoidoscopy who are &ge;65 years old receive two tap water enemas or an oral preparation with PEG-ELS. Significant complications have been associated with sodium phosphate enema use in older adults.
