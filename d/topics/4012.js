The presentations of patients with deficiencies of those hormones that control target glands are often similar to the presentations of patients with primary deficiencies of the target gland hormones they control, with some notable exceptions.</p><p>An overview of the clinical manifestations in patients with hypopituitarism will be provided here. The causes, diagnosis, and treatment of hypopituitarism are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-testing-for-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic testing for hypopituitarism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypopituitarism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Damage to the anterior pituitary can occur suddenly or slowly, can be mild or severe, and can affect the secretion of one, several, or all of its hormones. As a result, the clinical presentation of anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies varies, depending upon the following factors (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypopituitarism&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rapidity with which a disease affects anterior pituitary cells. Some diseases, such as pituitary apoplexy, develop rapidly, causing sudden impairment of corticotropin (ACTH) secretion and, consequently, sudden onset of symptoms of cortisol deficiency. Other insults, such as radiation therapy to the pituitary or hypothalamus, usually act slowly, causing symptoms many months or, more likely, years later.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The severity of the hormonal deficiency. Complete ACTH and cortisol deficiency, as an example, can cause symptoms under basal circumstances, while partial ACTH deficiency may cause symptoms only during times of physical stress.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The number of different anterior pituitary cells that are affected, leading to impairment in the secretion of one, a few, or all the pituitary hormones (called panhypopituitarism). As a general rule, the secretion of gonadotropins and growth hormone is more likely to be affected than ACTH and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Many exceptions occur, however, so that one may see a patient who has only isolated ACTH deficiency. Thus, one cannot make an assumption about the status of one pituitary hormone from the status of another.</p><p/><p>Patients in whom the hypopituitarism is due to a sellar mass may also have symptoms related to the mass, such as headache, visual loss, or diplopia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-presentation-and-evaluation-of-sellar-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes, presentation, and evaluation of sellar masses&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5311650\"><span class=\"h1\">HORMONE DEFICIENCIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">ACTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presentation of corticotropin (ACTH) deficiency (secondary adrenal insufficiency) is almost exclusively that of the resulting cortisol deficiency. In its most severe form, cortisol deficiency leads to death due to vascular collapse because cortisol is necessary for maintenance of peripheral vascular tone. A less severe form of the same phenomenon is postural hypotension and tachycardia. Mild, chronic deficiency may result in lassitude, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, decreased libido, hypoglycemia, and eosinophilia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are two important clinical distinctions between ACTH deficiency and primary adrenal insufficiency with a secondary increase in ACTH release (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;, section on 'Secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ACTH deficiency does not cause salt wasting, volume contraction, and hyperkalemia, because it does not result in clinically important deficiency of aldosterone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ACTH deficiency does not result in hyperpigmentation.</p><p/><p>Both forms of adrenal insufficiency can cause hyponatremia. This abnormality is due to inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) that is caused by cortisol (not aldosterone) deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyponatremia-and-hyperkalemia-in-adrenal-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia in adrenal insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important to realize that moderately severe ACTH and cortisol deficiency may cause few or no symptoms and no physical findings. Consequently, the adequacy of ACTH secretion should be evaluated biochemically in all patients who have pituitary or hypothalamic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;, section on 'Secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">TSH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common symptoms and signs of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency include fatigue, cold intolerance, decreased appetite, constipation, facial puffiness, dry skin, bradycardia, delayed relaxation phase of the deep tendon reflexes, and anemia. The degree of symptoms and abnormal physical findings usually parallels the degree of thyroxine deficiency, but as the case with ACTH deficiency, some patients with marked TSH deficiency have few or no symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-hypothyroidism#H18020398\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central hypothyroidism&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Gonadotropins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deficient secretion of the gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) results in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (secondary hypogonadism) in both women and men.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women, hypogonadism means ovarian hypofunction, which results in decreased estradiol secretion. The clinical consequences of estradiol deficiency in women with secondary hypogonadism are similar to those seen in women with primary hypogonadism (primary ovarian insufficiency [premature ovarian failure]). Findings in premenopausal women include irregular periods or amenorrhea, anovulatory infertility, hot flashes, and, eventually, vaginal atrophy. No physical findings of hypogonadism are detectable initially, but after several years, if estrogen therapy is not provided, breast tissue decreases and bone mineral density (BMD) declines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Serum androgen concentrations in women with hypopituitarism (particularly those with both gonadotropin and ACTH deficiency) are lower than those in normal control women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and appear to be correlated with BMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The clinical significance of this decrease has yet to be determined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-androgen-deficiency-and-therapy-in-women#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of androgen deficiency and therapy in women&quot;, section on 'Androgen deficiency'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In men, hypogonadism means testicular hypofunction, which results in infertility and decreased testosterone secretion. The latter causes decreased energy and libido and hot flashes if sufficiently severe, within weeks to months, but does not cause decreased muscle mass (and perhaps strength) for several years. Testosterone deficiency also causes decreased BMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-hypopituitarism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-male-hypogonadism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of male hypogonadism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth hormone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growth hormone deficiency in children typically presents as short stature (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-short-stature\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of short stature&quot;</a>). Clinical manifestations of growth hormone deficiency in adults include changes in body composition (increased fat mass with a decrease in lean body mass), decreased BMD, impaired quality of life, and increased mortality rates.</p><p>Adults with growth hormone deficiency may also be more likely to have dyslipidemia and increased inflammatory markers and biochemical markers of endothelial function.
