Noninvasive ventilation is now commonly used to assist ventilation in patients with a variety of chronic neuromuscular and chest wall diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The incidence of respiratory muscle dysfunction varies among these different entities. In neuromuscular disease, the degree of compromise may differ significantly between respiratory and nonrespiratory muscles, and not all respiratory muscles may be similarly impaired. The clinical course also varies, as the rate of progression may differ enormously between individuals with the same disease (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and respiratory muscle weakness may be:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Completely reversible (Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reversible with treatment (myasthenia gravis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapsing (multiple sclerosis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relentlessly progressive (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis)</p><p/><p>In several of these disease processes, respiratory function may also be compromised by parenchymal lung disease (eg, polymyositis) or abnormal control of breathing (eg, myotonic dystrophy). Nevertheless, despite the diversity of these underlying conditions, the respiratory consequences of severe disease tend to be similar. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Clinical manifestations and evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-of-respiratory-muscle-strength\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests of respiratory muscle strength&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-wall-diseases-and-restrictive-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chest wall diseases and restrictive physiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-complications-in-the-adult-patient-with-chronic-spinal-cord-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory complications in the adult patient with chronic spinal cord injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nocturnal noninvasive ventilation may be delivered by either positive or negative pressure devices. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is used for the majority of patients with respiratory insufficiency due to neuromuscular or chest wall disease and is discussed here. Detailed descriptions of the various types of noninvasive ventilation systems and common problems in their clinical use are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Types of noninvasive nocturnal ventilatory support in neuromuscular and chest wall disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=troubleshooting-problems-with-noninvasive-positive-pressure-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Troubleshooting problems with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of neuromuscular and chest wall diseases may lead to respiratory failure. These include spinal cord lesions, motor neuron disease, disorders of the neuromuscular junction, diseases of peripheral nerves, diseases of muscles, and chest wall disorders. Subjective clinical findings and objective physiologic tests are used to determine when nocturnal noninvasive ventilation is indicated in the management of patients with neuromuscular and chest wall disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79358\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79358 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In addition, symptoms suggestive of sleep disordered breathing or sleep apnea may favor evaluation in the sleep laboratory. Detailed discussions of patient selection are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Clinical manifestations and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Assess need for ventilatory support'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-muscle-weakness-due-to-neuromuscular-disease-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-noninvasive-ventilatory-support-for-patients-with-respiratory-muscle-dysfunction#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous noninvasive ventilatory support for patients with respiratory muscle dysfunction&quot;, section on 'Patient selection'</a>.)</p><p>The role of noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the decision is made to initiate noninvasive nocturnal ventilation, certain preparative steps will improve ultimate patient acceptance and success (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51437\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51437 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72444\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72444 \">table 3</a>). These include appropriate timing of initiation; mask selection and fitting; and selection of ventilator type and initial settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing and location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial trial of noninvasive nocturnal ventilatory support can be conducted in an outpatient setting, in a sleep laboratory, or during an overnight admission. To facilitate acceptance, an overnight admission may be most appropriate for patients who are anxious or have more advanced disease. If a prior sleep study has demonstrated obstructive sleep apnea or the patient has symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in addition to respiratory insufficiency related to neuromuscular or chest wall disease, then pressure titration in a sleep laboratory is appropriate. If this is not possible at the time of initiation, then an in-laboratory evaluation to determine if there is adequate control of the concomitant OSA can be done a few weeks after the initial set up. Because some patients with advanced neuromuscular disease have difficulty adapting to an in-laboratory environment, home sleep monitoring to assess adequacy of control of nocturnal hypoventilation and oxygenation may be a suitable alternative. </p><p>Wherever the initial trial is conducted, a trained provider is needed to work with the patient to select the correct mask size, implement the initial ventilator settings, and then adjust mask fit and ventilator settings to achieve patient comfort. This process may require some followup visits and usually takes two to four hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Masks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) masks are generally preferred for chronic applications, while oronasal masks are usually preferred for acute indications. Nasal pillows may be preferred by patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who are able to maintain a mouth seal; oronasal masks may be preferred by habitual mouth breathers who may find them more comfortable. However, quick release straps and close caregiver supervision are necessary in patients with significant upper extremity weakness who have difficulty removing the mask. Occasionally, a &quot;total&quot; face mask that seals on the forehead, sides of the face (including the eyes), and chin may be preferred by some patients because of problems with comfort or obtaining a good seal with the standard oronasal mask. Helmets are investigational and should not be used in this population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Types of noninvasive nocturnal ventilatory support in neuromuscular and chest wall disease&quot;, section on 'Interfaces'</a>.)</p><p>Templates are available to assist with mask sizing. In general, the smallest mask that fits comfortably should be selected. A more detailed description of types of masks is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Types of noninvasive nocturnal ventilatory support in neuromuscular and chest wall disease&quot;, section on 'Interfaces'</a>.)</p><p>An important aspect of mask fitting is setting the strap tension. A looser strap tension helps to protect the skin from irritation and breakdown, but this must be balanced against air leaks due to a loose fit. Generally, the least amount of strap tension that does not allow excessive leak is used. Some patients may need a chin strap to prevent air leakage from the mouth if they are using a nasal interface. If this is unsuccessful, an oronasal mask may need to be substituted.</p><p>If the cheek or neck becomes irritated by the strap edges, soft cloth strips of fleece or cotton may be placed under the straps to help protect the skin. Washing the face prior to placing the mask may help to decrease skin irritation. In addition, silicon inserts, artificial skin, or thin cloth liners may be placed between the skin and the mask if skin irritation from the mask starts to become a problem. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is now considered the mode of choice among noninvasive ventilators for reasons of convenience, portability, and efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other types of noninvasive ventilators are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Types of noninvasive nocturnal ventilatory support in neuromuscular and chest wall disease&quot;, section on 'Ventilators'</a>.)</p><p>Either pressure or volume-cycled ventilators may be used to deliver NPPV. The ventilatory mode used by pressure-cycled ventilators is also known as bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP). It delivers both a preset inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP). The assist-control mode is used for volume-cycled ventilators. Additional &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; modes such as average volume assured pressure support mode (AVAPS) or intelligent volume assured pressure support (iVPAPS) are available for NPPV.</p><p>Evidence to guide ventilator selection is lacking but most practitioners prescribe pressure-cycled ventilators. Regardless of whether a volume or pressure-cycled device is used, though, the initial priority should be to achieve patient comfort and acceptance rather than any particular level of improvement in gas exchange.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial settings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of initial settings is to provide a modest amount of ventilatory support, while allowing the patient to become acclimated to NPPV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51437\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51437 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72444\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72444 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Tolerance of bilevel positive airway pressure devices is facilitated by using <strong>low initial pressures</strong>. Initial inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) is typically 8 to 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) 4 to 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, (thus providing inspiratory pressure support [IPAP minus EPAP] of approximately 4 to 6 cm H<sub>2</sub>O).</p><p>Initial tidal volumes of 6 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> are employed when using a volume-cycled ventilator, starting at the low end of the range and increasing, as needed. These volumes may be higher than those commonly used for invasive ventilation, because of the frequent need to compensate for air leaks during noninvasive ventilation. Positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) is usually provided at 4 to 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O; slightly higher PEEP levels may be needed for patients with concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p><p>A backup respiratory rate is usually provided for both pressure and volume-cycled ventilators, usually 2 to 4 breaths per minute below the patient's spontaneous rate.</p><p>For patients with neuromuscular disease and concomitant OSA, a higher EPAP may be required to overcome airway obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In order to provide ventilatory support, the pressure difference between inspiratory and expiratory pressures (IPAP minus EPAP) would need to be maintained (ie, the IPAP would also need to be increased). To determine the optimal expiratory pressure for the OSA and the necessary inspiratory pressure support (difference between inspiratory and expiratory pressures) for hypoventilation, additional polysomnographic examination is needed. Polysomnographic titration should aim not only to eliminate apneas, hypopneas, and respiratory related arousals, but also to augment ventilation in patients with chronic hypoventilation. These aims can be achieved on an outpatient basis with gradual titration in pressure settings as tolerated and periodic home sleep monitoring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjustments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the initial pressures or volumes have been set, the mask and straps are readjusted as needed to reduce leakage of air from the mask, using the least strap tension necessary. The patient is encouraged to relax and &quot;let the ventilator do the breathing.&quot; Initiation during the daytime using a diversion such as watching television may be helpful to facilitate adaptation. A low dose of benzodiazepine may help ease the initial transition to NPPV; however, this should be avoided in patients with hypercapnia.</p><p>If the patient is very claustrophobic, it may be helpful for them to hold the mask on their face for a few minutes rather than using the straps right away. This allows the patient to remove and reapply the mask quickly during those first few minutes and gives the patient a sense of control. Once the patient can tolerate the mask, the straps will need to be attached for effective ventilation.</p><p>For those being started as an outpatient, noninvasive ventilation is continued for an additional one to two hours. For those who are staying overnight in the hospital or in a sleep lab that has special expertise in noninvasive ventilation, NPPV can be continued as long as the patient can tolerate it through the night. During this additional time, further adjustments are made to optimize comfort and provide patient and family education, before the patient is discharged to use NPPV at home. However, a small randomized trial found no advantage of initiation during a few days&rsquo; hospitalization compared to initiation at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The 2011 NPPV Titration Task Force of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends initial titration of pressures in a sleep lab to optimize pressure settings in addition to comfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It is believed that titration in the lab with careful analysis of effort and flow may help to mitigate patient-ventilator asynchrony that may occur when patients are initially placed on NPPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, this recommendation is based on expert opinion and evidence is lacking to demonstrate the superiority of this approach over home initiation. Thus, if in-lab polysomnography is not readily available or the lab lacks the appropriate experience, then initiation of NPPV should not be delayed while waiting for a study. The adaption process described below may be initiated in the outpatient setting, and the patient may subsequently be evaluated in the lab if problems are encountered. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Adaptation'</a> below.)</p><p>An arterial blood gas at the end of the trial is useful to gauge the augmentation of ventilatory assistance. To prevent an acute alkalosis, we generally aim for an overnight decrease in arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) of 8 mmHg (1.06 kPa) or less. Noninvasive measurements, such as oxygen saturation, may also be useful to monitor gas exchange in patients with restrictive thoracic disorders and normal lungs. During administration of NPPV, end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>) measurements via the mask may underestimate actual PaCO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Upward adjustments are made in inspiratory pressures or tidal volumes as indicated by symptoms, gas exchange, and patient tolerance. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Adaptation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Humidification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heated humidification is now considered standard on most noninvasive ventilatory units. Nasal saline <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heated humidification enhance comfort by decreasing dryness in the upper airway and may also decrease nasal resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. If the heated humidifier is set too high and the room air is cold, water condensation, also called &quot;rainout,&quot; may occur in the tubing or mask. Reducing the temperature setting of the heated humidifier may help reduce this phenomenon. Alternatively, heated tubing has significantly decreased the problem of water condensation and is available with several brands of PAP. In addition, water chamber and tube temperature can be linked in an &quot;auto&quot; mode that regulates the humidity based on the desired setting and the ambient air humidity. If heated tubing is not available and condensation is still noted, the tubing may be insulated with light weight cloth, a commercially available tube sleeve made for CPAP tubing or other insulating material created by the patient or family.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ADAPTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The adaptation phase (ie, the first few weeks after initiation) poses the greatest challenge in gaining patient acceptance of noninvasive ventilation. Initially, patients are encouraged to use the device for an hour or two during the daytime, distracting themselves by watching television or reading. When comfortable with the mask, they are instructed to use the noninvasive ventilator each night for at least a few hours, or as long as possible.</p><p>With noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), patients often have trouble adapting to sleeping with an unfamiliar object strapped to their face. Hospitalization may help the particularly anxious patient or those who are medically less stable, but it is unnecessary for success in most patients.</p><p>Adjustments are often necessary in strap tension, types of straps used, and mask sizes and types after the patient has returned home. An experienced home respiratory therapist who is willing to experiment with these adjustments can be very helpful. Adjustment of the inspiratory time or trigger sensitivity may also help to improve patient tolerance of NPPV.</p><p>An important aspect of adaptation is to provide pressures that are sufficient to assist ventilation. Once the patient has begun using the device nocturnally and has been able to fall asleep, the inspiratory pressure is increased to control symptoms of CO<sub>2</sub> retention (morning headache and daytime hypersomnolence) and to reverse hypoventilation. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Increases in pressure are made gradually as tolerated at increments of perhaps 2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O per week. The larger the difference between inspiratory and expiratory pressure, the greater the inspiratory support provided to assist ventilation. This difference is usually at least 8 to 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, and may range up to 20 or more cm H<sub>2</sub>O in patients with high inspiratory impedance due to scoliosis or obesity.</p><p>Patients encountering difficulty adapting are encouraged but never forced to persist. Most patients are able to sleep successfully through the night after a few weeks but some may require months. Often, adaptation succeeds when patients begin noticing symptomatic improvement. However, perhaps 5 to 10 percent of patients fail to adapt successfully to NPPV, usually because of mask discomfort or claustrophobia. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Failure of nocturnal NPPV'</a> below.)</p><p>Sleep aids like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprazolam</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolpidem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zolpidem</a> are occasionally helpful to facilitate acclimatization to NPPV; they should be avoided in patients with baseline CO<sub>2</sub> retention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial monitoring should focus on patient acceptance of the device, number of hours of use, problems encountered, and symptoms of hypoventilation. Patients should be seen initially every few weeks for assessment of symptoms such as morning headache and hypersomnolence, and for measurement of vital signs and daytime arterial blood gases. It is unrealistic to expect improvements in symptoms or gas exchange until the patient is using the device at least four to five hours nightly, so initial monitoring of gas exchange is performed primarily to assure stability.</p><p>Improvements in symptoms and gas exchange should be anticipated once the patient has successfully adapted and is sleeping through most of the night while using the device. Daytime heart rate often slows when noninvasive ventilation has been successful.</p><p>Pulse oximetry and end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P<sub>ET</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>) measurements may be helpful in assessing trends; however, end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> must be measured off the ventilator because of inaccurate readings of gas sampled via the mask [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Measurement of transcutaneous CO<sub>2</sub> is suitable for nocturnal monitoring and compares favorably with blood gas measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. &#160; </p><p>The aim of chronic noninvasive ventilation should be to lower and stabilize daytime arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO<sub>2</sub>); improve sleep quality and oxygenation; and ameliorate daytime symptoms. The optimal daytime PaCO<sub>2</sub> is not known and probably varies among patients. We have observed that patients tolerate daytime spontaneous PaCO<sub>2</sub> levels from 45 to 60 mmHg (5.99 to 7.98 kPa) without cor pulmonale, requirement for O<sub>2</sub> supplementation, or worsening of hypoventilation symptoms.</p><p>Once the patient is using the device for at least several hours out of every 24 hour cycle, a nocturnal study during noninvasive ventilation may be useful. Overnight pulse oximetry assesses adequacy of gas exchange and determines whether O<sub>2</sub> supplementation is indicated. If the patient encounters difficulty adapting or the overnight oximetry shows desaturations, overnight polysomnography may be obtained, particularly for patients in whom the clinician has a high clinical suspicion of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Patients with difficulty using the device nocturnally can still achieve gas exchange benefits by daytime use.</p><p>If symptoms and daytime PaCO<sub>2</sub> are well-controlled and nocturnal oximetry shows no desaturation, further adjustments in inspiratory pressure can be made for optimization. Once stabilized, patients can be seen at six monthly intervals, with arterial blood gases and nocturnal oximetry repeated as clinically indicated. Serum bicarbonate can be followed as an indicator of PaCO<sub>2</sub> and arterial blood gases can be repeated to confirm any upward trends. The frequency and intensity of monitoring has to be tailored to the severity of the patient's respiratory impairment and anticipated rate of progression. Patients with more rapidly progressive muscle weakness such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may need to be seen more frequently for adjustments in ventilator settings or duration of ventilator use as the disease progresses. As the underlying disease progresses additional hours of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) will eventually be necessary, culminating in <span class=\"nowrap\">24/7</span> ventilation in some patients. Many patients can succeed with continuous noninvasive ventilation, but some will switch to invasive ventilation via tracheostomy, especially if swallowing function is impaired. </p><p>If symptoms and gas exchange fail to improve with NPPV, home sleep monitoring may be helpful to identify the problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These devices can monitor pulse oximetry, chest wall motion, and airflow at the nose or mask pressure and may detect excessive air leaking or persistent obstructive apneas. Most positive pressure ventilators also have built-in monitoring capabilities that can document <span class=\"nowrap\">hours/night</span> of ventilator use, inspiratory pressure, leaks, and inspiratory airflow to detect apneas and hypopneas. </p><p>Full in-lab nocturnal polysomnography may be useful in patients who fail to improve or who deteriorate after prior stabilization, particularly when home monitoring has been unhelpful. In addition to detection of sleep apnea and hypoventilation, these studies allow sleep staging and detection of arousals that are associated with ineffective inspiratory effort (patient effort that does not trigger the ventilator), asynchrony, air leaking through the mouth or around the mask, and other factors that may contribute to a less than optimal symptom resolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIAL BENEFITS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential benefits of nocturnal noninvasive ventilatory support include improvements in survival, daytime gas exchange, sleep, and quality of life. These have been evaluated in one randomized study and several case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/14-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-20</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one trial, 41 patients with respiratory insufficiency due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were randomly assigned to either noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) or no nocturnal ventilatory support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

It is hypothesized that central chemoreceptor sensitivity may be restored by correction of profound nocturnal hypercapnia, or that the quality of sleep is changed when nocturnal noninvasive ventilation is employed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

Stability in these patients may be restored by adding daytime naps and extending the total duration of NPPV per 24 hour period. In addition, various combinations of noninvasive ventilatory support, manually assisted coughing, mechanically assisted coughing with <span class=\"nowrap\">insufflation/exsufflation</span> devices, and glossopharyngeal breathing may be used to promote clearance of secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/17,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,28,29</a>].

An approach to resolving these complications is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=troubleshooting-problems-with-noninvasive-positive-pressure-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Troubleshooting problems with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">INVASIVE VENTILATORY SUPPORT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients whose respiratory insufficiency is not adequately addressed by noninvasive ventilation, the decision to switch from noninvasive to invasive ventilation depends in large part upon patient preference. Some patients are reluctant or flatly refuse to consider invasive ventilation. Most prefer to continue noninvasive ventilation as long as possible and some remain on noninvasive ventilation indefinitely.</p><p>For patients who will accept short or long-term invasive ventilation, the clearest indications are failure to maintain adequate oxygenation, acute respiratory acidosis, and the inability to adequately protect the upper airway, due to impaired swallowing or cough, excessive secretions, or a combination of these factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The use of invasive ventilation may be temporary if inability to protect the airway is related to an infection-induced increase in secretions. Noninvasive ventilatory assistance may be resumed when the secretions subside.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECT ON CAREGIVERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited information is available about the impact of NPPV on caregivers of patients with neuromuscular and chest wall diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. As patients survive longer with NPPV, caregiver stress appears to increase due to a greater duration of progressive illness. This does not mean that NPPV should not be instituted, but rather that adequate support and training for caregivers should be an important part of the overall care provided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noninvasive ventilation (ie, ventilation without an invasive artificial airway) is now used commonly to assist ventilation in patients with a variety of chronic neuromuscular and chest wall diseases. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential recipients of noninvasive ventilation should be selected using established guidelines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79358\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79358 \">table 1</a>). Polysomnography may be included in the evaluation to assess for concomitant obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but is not necessary for noninvasive ventilation of patients with neuromuscular disease to qualify for reimbursement. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Initiation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with neuromuscular or chest wall disease who require nocturnal ventilatory support, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is generally preferred over other types of noninvasive ventilators for reasons of convenience, portability, and efficacy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Initiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard nasal (CPAP) or nasal pillow masks are usually preferred for chronic applications, while oronasal masks are preferred for acute indications. Patients experiencing excessive air leaking through the mouth with nasal interfaces may benefit from using a chin strap with the nasal interface or changing to an oronasal mask. Less commonly, patients will prefer use of a mouthpiece interface. Newer, larger face masks that encompass the eyes may be helpful in patients intolerant of other masks. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Masks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Either a pressure or a volume-cycled ventilator may be used to deliver NPPV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51437\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51437 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72444\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72444 \">table 3</a>). When using a bilevel positive airway pressure device, we select low initial pressures to improve patient tolerance. For example, initial inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) is typically 8 to 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) typically 4 to 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. When using a volume-cycled ventilator, we select assist-control mode with initial tidal volumes in the range of 6 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg,</span> starting at the low end of the range and increasing, as needed. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Initiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the initial pressures or volumes have been set, the mask and straps are readjusted as needed to reduce leakage of air from the mask, using as little strap tension as possible; some patients using a nasal mask may need a chin strap to control oral air leakage. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Adjustments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After initiating nocturnal NPPV, inspiratory pressure or tidal volume are gradually adjusted upward to lower and stabilize daytime arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>); improve sleep quality and oxygenation; and ameliorate daytime symptoms. Overnight pulse oximetry assesses adequacy of gas exchange and determines whether O<sub>2</sub> supplementation is indicated. The optimal daytime PaCO<sub>2</sub> is not known and probably varies among patients, although patients seem to tolerate daytime spontaneous PaCO<sub>2</sub> levels from 45 to 60 mmHg (5.99 to 7.98 kPa). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polysomnography may be helpful in the evaluation of patients who are not improving with NPPV or are having difficulty tolerating it. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with nocturnal hypoventilation caused by neuromuscular or chest wall disease, nocturnal NPPV may improve survival and quality of life.
