However, there has been a shift in the epidemiology of this disease, with a significant increase in cases due to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and a decrease in cases associated with tobacco and alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These HPV associated cancers predominantly arise in the oropharynx, particularly the tonsillar area and the tongue base. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus associated head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Based on data demonstrating the better prognosis of HPV related oropharyngeal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual has modified the N stage for HPV related tumors, changing N1 to one or more ipsilateral lymph nodes, all &le;6 cm, while N2 is defined as bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, all &le;6 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. N3 is lymph node &gt;6 cm. The main change is that multiple lymph nodes do not change the good prognosis of HPV related oropharyngeal carcinoma compared with a single node (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110640%7EONC%2F110641\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110640 graphicRef110641 \">table 1A-B</a>). Additionally, the final stage, combining T, N, and M, changes dramatically, with most previous stage 4A and 4B now categorized as stage I or II in the HPV system.</p><p>Although HPV positive carcinomas have a better prognosis, the approach to treatment is currently the same for oropharyngeal tumors of the same stage for AJCC 7 stage cancers. Since AJCC 8 will downstage some stage III and IVA cancers to stage I or II, using the AJCC 8 treatment is NOT the same stage for stage. For example, many stage I and II HPV associated cancers in AJCC 8 will still be locoregionally advanced and require combined modality treatment, whereas non-HPV associated stage I and II AJCC 8 cancers will be treated with single modality surgery or radiation therapy. Clinical trials currently either stratify for HPV status or are designed specifically for patients with HPV associated cancer to answer questions related to minimizing treatment-related toxicities in those with HPV associated carcinoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">NONSURGICAL VERSUS SURGICAL APPROACHES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer (AJCC 7,8 stages III and <span class=\"nowrap\">IVA/B</span> plus AJCC 8 T3 or T4 or node positive) includes T3 or T4 primary tumors without lymph node involvement and T1 or greater tumors with cervical node involvement but without distant metastases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110640\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110640 \">table 1A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110641\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110641 \">table 1B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110659\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110659 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110628\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110628 \">table 3</a>). Optimal treatment requires a multidisciplinary team approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Selecting between nonsurgical organ-sparing approaches and primary surgery as the most appropriate treatment for patients with locally advanced, resectable oropharyngeal cancer is complex. There are no large randomized trials that compare functional organ preservation using a combination of chemotherapy plus RT versus an initial surgical approach followed by radiation or chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer.</p><p>Although functional organ preservation approaches are widely used, surgery followed by either postoperative radiation therapy (RT) or by concurrent chemoradiotherapy is an alternative in appropriately selected patients. However, for patients with unresectable (T4b) or advanced nodal disease, a combined modality approach that includes chemotherapy plus RT, given either sequentially <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> concurrently, is used. (See <a href=\"#H950792255\" class=\"local\">'Functional organ preservation approaches'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13562838\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H950792255\"><span class=\"h1\">FUNCTIONAL ORGAN PRESERVATION APPROACHES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with potentially resectable disease, nonsurgical functional organ preservation approaches that include both chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT) are generally used, even when gross removal of the entire tumor with acceptable functional and cosmetic outcomes is thought to be feasible. However, initial clinical trials and expert opinions provide some evidence that surgery can also be used to assist in reduction of the total radiation dose and treatment volume and, thus, minimize long-term complications in patients with smaller primary tumors. Surgery may be a reasonable component of a multidisciplinary approach and is presently under investigation for HPV positive patients in the ECOG 3311 trial, which has recently completed enrollment. (See <a href=\"#H13562838\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>The optimal agents and schedule are controversial and are discussed in detail separately. This discussion will focus on the application of those approaches to patients with a primary carcinoma of the oropharynx.

The MACH-NC analysis confirmed that regimens that included both chemotherapy and RT significantly decreased the risk of death in 5872 patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma compared with RT alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.82-0.93). This corresponded to an absolute improvement of 5 percent in overall survival at five years and 8 percent when the chemotherapy was given concurrently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. No survival benefit was observed with chemotherapy in the induction or adjuvant setting, although notably the subset of patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU) induction chemotherapy did derive a small benefit. Importantly, in oropharyngeal carcinoma there is no indication that induction chemotherapy provides benefit for survival when compared with chemoradiation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=locally-advanced-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck-approaches-combining-chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy#H281026429\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Approaches combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy&quot;, section on 'Definitive locoregional therapy alone vs chemotherapy plus definitive locoregional therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Most of the studies included in the MACH-NC meta-analysis took place prior to the demographic and biological shift in oropharyngeal cancer associated with the current predominance of HPV related oropharyngeal cancer. It is not clear if these data apply to HPV related oropharyngeal cancer; however, until additional studies are completed specifically for HPV related oropharyngeal cancer, treatment paradigms for HPV related and carcinogen-related oropharyngeal cancers remain identical. Contemporary trials have explored alternative schedules and regimens for combined modality therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Contemporary trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for regimens combining chemotherapy and RT. In the MACH-NC meta-analysis comparing different chemotherapy regimens, platinum-based chemotherapy was superior to non-platinum-based regimens; there was no significant difference between single-agent platinum and multiagent concurrent chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3202958179\"><span class=\"h2\">Induction chemotherapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H521750111\"><span class=\"h3\">Induction chemotherapy followed by radiation with or without surgery (locoregional therapy) versus definitive locoregional therapy alone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the MACH-NC meta-analysis showed minimal impact of induction chemotherapy on survival compared with locoregional therapy alone, there was a benefit when using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> and FU combinations. The impact of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on survival in oropharyngeal cancer was demonstrated in a more recent French trial in which 318 patients were randomly assigned to receive three cycles of cisplatin plus a five-day intravenous infusion of FU followed by locoregional therapy or definitive locoregional therapy alone. Locoregional therapy was defined as surgery with radiation or radiation alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Overall survival was significantly better in those given neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with those treated with definitive locoregional therapy alone (median survival 5.1 versus 3.3 years). </p><p>Hence, induction chemotherapy followed by RT may be a reasonable treatment option for those very select patients who are not ideal candidates for chemoradiation but may tolerate induction chemotherapy. However, no randomized trial has ever compared these two treatment strategies head to head, and induction chemotherapy is not superior to CRT for oropharyngeal cancer and should not be regarded as a substitute.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4060884785\"><span class=\"h3\">Sequential induction chemotherapy followed by radiation with or without surgery (locoregional therapy) versus definitive locoregional therapy alone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether sequential therapy (induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy) provides a survival advantage compared with concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone remains uncertain. The most current data are not definitive. However, patients with advanced neck disease and some T4 patients (N2c or N3) may be considered candidates for induction chemotherapy prior to chemoradiation in an effort to delay the onset of distant metastases and improve survival.

Concurrent cetuximab plus RT was evaluated in a multinational randomized study of patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer, in which approximately 60 percent of patients had oropharyngeal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The addition of cetuximab improved both locoregional control and overall survival compared with RT alone. In a retrospective analysis of this study, p16 status was strongly prognostic for patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. The data suggest that the addition of&nbsp;cetuximab&nbsp;to RT improved clinical outcomes, regardless of p16 or HPV status versus RT alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Subset analyses showed that the benefit of cetuximab plus RT was restricted to patients less than age 65 years with a Karnofsky performance score (KPS) 90 to 100 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 \">table 4</a>), although the trial was not powered to analyze these subsets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Overall survival was better with RT alone in patients 65 years of age and older, and those with KPS 60 to 80, although these differences were not statistically significant.

Preliminary data suggest that IMRT might reduce the risk of this complication. In a prospective study of 73 patients being treated for oropharyngeal cancer, IMRT was combined with weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This study excluded patients with involvement of medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes, and thus, the dose of radiation to the pharyngeal constrictors was limited. At one year after treatment, dysphagia was present in only four patients, one of whom was dependent upon a feeding tube and three who required a soft diet.

These approaches are most feasible for early tumor (T) stage tumors of the oropharynx <span class=\"nowrap\">(T1/T2)</span> and become more challenging with advanced T stages, particularly for those tumors with mandibular involvement. </p><p>Excellent overall survival and swallowing results have been reported using TLM as primary treatment for advanced stage oropharyngeal cancer in a multicenter study, although early T stage tumors had better survival rates than advanced T stage tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Early node (N) stage, negative surgical margins, and p16 positivity (indicating HPV positivity) were factors noted to be associated with improved survival. While only 58 percent of patients received adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) in this study, radiation reduced the risk of death by 50 percent. Similarly, TORS achieves excellent functional and oncologic outcomes when combined with risk-based adjuvant treatment in patients with early T stage tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Both of these studies had a high prevalence (90 percent) of HPV related tumors, which may contribute to the excellent results. The independent contribution of TORS (versus RT) is not clear, and randomized studies will be needed to evaluate both the functional and oncologic outcome of RT and TORS. </p><p>A study of the impact of TORS on overall treatment in patients with oropharyngeal cancer showed that, with appropriate selection, TORS with neck dissection can yield good functional results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, TORS can also provide accurate staging of patients and lead to appropriate selection of subsequent therapy. In this series, 42 patients were in the TORS group and compared with 38 patients in the conventional chemoradiation group; 43 percent of patients receiving initial surgery had a change in stage, and subsequent therapy was altered in 21 percent. This occurred at the primary site as well as the neck, and was found to change staging in both directions. Survival was not compromised in the surgical group.</p><p>When early primary stage is accompanied by advanced nodal staging, controversy exists over the best treatment approach. Since many of these patients will require adjuvant chemoradiation for their advanced nodal stage disease, the question arises whether transoral approaches add benefit to those patients who may be cured by chemoradiation alone and which approaches offer the best functional results. Excellent overall survival and swallowing results have also been reported with chemoradiation approaches for advanced oropharyngeal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Active investigation is ongoing in this area, with prospective clinical trials being planned to address this question. </p><p>Most surgeons favor composite resection (mandibulectomy) for tumors with gross bony involvement. While prospective randomized trials are lacking, gross mandibular invasion is difficult to cure with nonsurgical approaches and, in many cases, leads to osteoradionecrosis due to high doses of radiation to the mandible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H430870141\"><span class=\"h1\">OLDER AND POOR PERFORMANCE STATUS PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemoradiotherapy is often avoided in older patients with advanced oropharyngeal cancer as well as in those with a poor performance status since the use of concurrent chemotherapy may delay or prevent the completion of a course of definitive radiation therapy (RT). In fact, the MACH-NC meta-analysis suggests that the benefit of concurrent chemotherapy added to RT is lost in those over 70 and is indeed harmful in those over 80 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Furthermore, older adults, in particular those over the age of 70, may be underrepresented in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Concurrent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a> may be less toxic than a platinum compound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-locoregionally-advanced-stage-iii-and-iv-head-and-neck-cancer-the-oropharynx/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].
