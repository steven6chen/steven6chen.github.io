The tear duct is how tears drain from the eye. It is a path of small tubes that runs from the inner eyelid to the inside of the nose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F90651\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90651 \">figure 1</a>). If the tear duct is blocked, tears can't drain normally. This causes symptoms.</p><p>A blocked tear duct is a common condition in babies. Babies who have a blocked tear duct are usually born with it.</p><p>Older children and adults can also get a blocked tear duct. The cause of the blockage is usually an eye infection or injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25519656\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a blocked tear duct?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of a blocked tear duct can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased tearing &ndash; This can happen some or all of the time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crusting of the eyelids</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness of the white part of the eye</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blue-colored area of swelling between the eye and nose &ndash; This only happens if both ends of the tear duct are blocked.</p><p/><p>Sometimes, a blocked tear duct gets infected. An infection happens when germs grow in the tears that are stuck in the tear duct.</p><p>Symptoms of a tear duct infection can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warmth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pus draining from the eye</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25519671\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not. The doctor or nurse should be able to tell if your child has a blocked tear duct by learning about his or her symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p>The doctor or nurse might do a test to check how well the tear duct is working.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25519686\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a blocked tear duct treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the person's age, the cause of the blockage, and if there is an infection.</p><p>Doctors treat infected tear ducts with antibiotics. Some antibiotics go in the eye. Others come in pills or liquids that you swallow.</p><p>Most babies do not need treatment unless their tear duct is infected. That's because most blocked tear ducts open up on their own by the time a baby is 6 months old.</p><p>To help your baby's tear duct open up, your doctor or nurse might recommend that you gently massage it. He or she will show you how to do this.</p><p>If the tear duct doesn't open up on its own, your baby might need to see an eye specialist (called an ophthalmologist). This doctor can do a procedure to open up the tear duct. During the procedure, he or she will put a thin tool into the tear duct and push open the blockage.</p><p>If the tear duct stays blocked, or the blockage comes back, your doctor will talk with you about other possible treatments. These include procedures to widen the tear duct.</p><p>The treatment for older children and adults with a blocked tear duct depends on the cause of the blockage. Different treatments might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure to widen the tear duct</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to make a new pathway that will allow tears to drain</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25519701\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=conjunctivitis-pink-eye-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Conjunctivitis (pink eye) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=conjunctivitis-pink-eye-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Conjunctivitis (pink eye) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
