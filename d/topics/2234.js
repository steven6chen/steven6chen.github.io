The terms doctors use for these tests are &quot;pulmonary function tests&quot; or &quot;PFTs.&quot; Specifically, breathing tests measure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much air you can breathe in and out of your lungs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How fast you can breathe the air out of your lungs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How much oxygen gets into your blood from your lungs</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260645222\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might my doctor order breathing tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor might order breathing tests to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Find the cause of symptoms such as a long-term cough, noisy breathing (wheezing), or trouble breathing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check if a known lung condition is mild or severe, or changes over time &ndash; Lung conditions that are commonly followed with breathing tests include asthma, chronic bronchitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (also called &quot;COPD&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check how well your inhaler medicines are working</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Check how well your lungs are working before you have surgery</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260645237\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I prepare for breathing tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will tell you if you need to do anything special to prepare for your breathing tests. If you take an inhaler, your doctor might have you wait to take your medicine after the test (instead of before).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260645252\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the different breathing tests and what do they involve?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The different breathing tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spirometry &ndash; This is the breathing test most commonly done. It involves breathing in as deeply as you can, and then breathing out as hard and as fast as you can into a tube (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F84004\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef84004 \">figure 1</a>). The tube is attached to a machine called a &quot;spirometer.&quot; The doctor, nurse, or technician will give you specific directions about how to breathe for the test. Spirometry measures how much air you can breathe in and out of your lungs and how fast you can breathe the air out of your lungs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">During this test, the doctor, nurse, or technician might give you medicine to open up your airways. This medicine comes as an inhaler that you breathe in. Then, you will repeat the spirometry test to see whether the medicine has affected your breathing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung volume measurement &ndash; This test measures how much air is in your lungs. Some lung diseases increase the amount of air in your lungs. Other diseases decrease the amount of air in your lungs. The test involves sitting in a large glass box that looks like a phone booth. While you are in this box, you will breathe in and out through a tube. The technician might ask you to pant (breathe in and out quickly) during the test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffusing capacity &ndash; This test measures how well oxygen gets from your lungs into your blood. It involves breathing in a certain gas, and then breathing out into a tube.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Six-minute walk test &ndash; This test measures how far you can walk in 6 minutes. It also measures how much oxygen is in your blood before and after you walk for 6 minutes. While you walk, you will wear a sensor on your finger that measures how much oxygen is in your blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial blood gas &ndash; This test measures how much oxygen is in your blood. It involves having blood drawn from an artery in your wrist. Then the blood sample is sent to a lab for tests.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260645267\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the downsides of breathing tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on the test. For instance, breathing in and out fast and hard during spirometry can make people cough, or feel light-headed or dizzy. It can also cause a feeling of pressure in the chest, belly, or head.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260645282\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child needs breathing tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children ages 6 and older can follow directions well enough to have breathing tests.</p><p>If your child is 5 years old or younger, the doctor can change the way the tests are done. He or she will also have the tests done by someone who has a lot of experience working with children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H260645297\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-bronchitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic bronchitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-including-emphysema-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=shortness-of-breath-dyspnea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Shortness of breath (dyspnea) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-including-emphysema-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-cough-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic cough in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
