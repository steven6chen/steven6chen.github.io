This topic will discuss the management of regional and general anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Regional anesthesia techniques, adverse effects of neuraxial anesthesia, and neuraxial labor analgesia are reviewed separately.

At a minimum, the physical exam should include an assessment of the vital signs, airway, cardiac and respiratory systems, and lower back. In the case of a scheduled and non-urgent, non-emergent cesarean delivery, adequate preoperative fasting should be verified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-fasting-guidelines#H593907955\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative fasting guidelines&quot;, section on 'Pregnancy'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The preoperative assessment for emergent cesarean delivery should be as comprehensive as time permits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antenatal anesthesia consultation</strong> &ndash; It is reasonable to schedule an antenatal consultation with an anesthesiologist for patients at risk of complications due to preexisting conditions, even if cesarean delivery is not planned. Each parturient should be viewed as a potential candidate for operative delivery during labor, possibly on an emergent basis. Some of the indications for antenatal anesthesia consultation are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68666\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68666 \">table 1</a>). &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laboratory testing </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Preoperative laboratory testing should be individualized, based on patient factors and institutional norms. Pregnant women generally have a blood type and antibody screen performed as part of routine prenatal care; repeat preoperative type and screen and crossmatch should be performed for patients at high risk of severe bleeding, and for those with red blood cell antibodies. Baseline hemoglobin, platelet count, and coagulation testing may be indicated for specific conditions.

Guidelines for preoperative fasting and pharmacologic aspiration prophylaxis are based on gastric physiology and expert opinion, as there is limited evidence that interventions improve outcomes. Because worse outcome may be associated with aspiration of particulate matter, acidic material, and of large volumes, goals for aspiration prophylaxis are to eliminate particulate gastric contents and to decrease the volume and acidity of stomach contents at the time of induction of anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Preoperative fasting</strong> &ndash; Gastric emptying is not changed by pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>], and preoperative fasting guidelines are the same for elective cesarean delivery as for other surgical procedures (ie, two hour fast for clear liquids, six hours for solids, eight hours for fatty meals). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-fasting-guidelines#H593907955\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative fasting guidelines&quot;, section on 'Pregnancy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preoperative-fasting-guidelines#H466491516\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preoperative fasting guidelines&quot;, section on 'Fasting recommendations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Pharmacologic prophylaxis</strong> &ndash; Practice varies with respect to administration of pharmacologic agents prior to scheduled and emergent cesarean delivery. We agree with the American Society of Anesthesiologists Practice Guidelines for Obstetric Anesthesia, which state that the timely administration of nonparticulate antacids, H2 receptor antagonists, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> should be considered before surgical procedures (eg, cesarean delivery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Options for pharmacologic prophylaxis include nonparticulate antacids (ie, sodium citrate 30 mL orally), H2 receptor blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> 50 mg IV or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famotidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famotidine</a> 20 mg IV), proton pump inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> 20 mg orally), and prokinetic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> 10 mg IV). Sodium citrate increases stomach pH immediately and for approximately an hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], while the other prophylactic medications require 30 to 40 minutes to be effective.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">A combination of prophylactic agents may be more effective than single medications. This was demonstrated by a metaanalysis of 22 randomized studies involving pharmacologic aspiration prophylaxis for women who had general anesthesia for cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The combined administration of antacids with H2 antagonists was more effective at reducing gastric acidity (ie, pH &lt;2.5) than antacids alone, and more effective than placebo.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Premedication </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Unlike many other surgical procedures, sedatives are not generally administered as premedication prior to cesarean delivery, as these medications cross the placenta and also may result in some degree of amnesia for the baby's birth. Reassurance and verbal support by the anesthesia clinician provide sufficient anxiolysis for most patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, for particularly anxious patients, premedication may be required and may be safely administered, to allow placement of a neuraxial anesthetic, or to help the patient tolerate surgery while awake with neuraxial anesthesia. In one randomized trial, the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> (0.02 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> (0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> IV) prior to spinal anesthesia for cesarean delivery resulted in similar neonatal Apgar scores, pulse oximetry, and neurobehavioral scores when compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. There was also no difference in the ability of the mother to recall the birth. In our practice, a single dose of IV midazolam (1 to 2 mg) given prior to cesarean delivery is often sufficient for maternal anxiolysis, and the addition of fentanyl is not necessary. In patients who may be particularly anxious about neuraxial placement for a planned cesarean delivery, 30 to 50% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> by a patient-controlled mask may be an appropriate adjunct during neuraxial placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>IV access </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>We place one 16- to 18-gauge IV catheter in preparation for routine elective cesarean delivery. We place additional IV catheters as indicated by the risk of hemorrhage, or to allow administration of magnesium when indicated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monitoring </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Standard American Society of Anesthesiologists monitors include pulse rate, blood pressure measurement, electrocardiography, oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry, and temperature monitoring. If sedatives are administered, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) should be monitored as well. Although supplemental oxygen is not necessary, many providers administer supplemental oxygen via an ETCO<sub>2</sub> detection-enabled nasal cannula.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The fetal heart rate should be documented prior to cesarean delivery. If possible, laboring patients who were monitored in the labor room should continue to be monitored after transfer to the operating room when surgery is significantly delayed or when clinically indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-preoperative-planning-and-patient-preparation#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Preoperative planning and patient preparation&quot;, section on 'Fetal heart rate monitoring'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preoperative antibiotics</strong> &ndash; A single intravenous dose of a narrow spectrum antibiotic should be administered preoperatively to all women undergoing planned cesarean delivery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87200\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87200 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-preoperative-planning-and-patient-preparation#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Preoperative planning and patient preparation&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The use of extended spectrum antibiotic combinations for women at increased risk of postcesarean infection (eg, cesarean delivery performed during labor or at least four hours after rupture of membranes) is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-preoperative-planning-and-patient-preparation#H868182478\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Preoperative planning and patient preparation&quot;, section on 'Patients who may benefit from extended-spectrum antibiotics'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Antimicrobial therapy should be administered within 60 minutes before skin incision, rather than after cord clamping. This recommendation is supported by a meta-analysis of randomized trials that compared infection rates in women assigned to a single preincision dose of antibiotics, versus administration after cord clamping. Preincision prophylaxis was more effective than delayed administration for prevention of endometritis, without adverse neonatal outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H741059322\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF ANESTHETIC TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Options for anesthesia for cesarean delivery include general and neuraxial anesthesia (ie, spinal anesthesia, combined spinal-epidural anesthesia, and epidural anesthesia). The choice of anesthetic technique should be based on maternal and fetal status, comorbidities, expected duration and difficulty of the procedure, and the presence (or absence) of an in situ epidural or spinal catheter.</p><p>Although not recommended for first-line use, in rare circumstances, peripheral nerve blocks (eg, transverse abdominis plane blocks together with ilioinguinal block) have been used for anesthesia for cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

Based on data from the Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System, anesthesia related maternal case fatality rates have changed over time; fatality with general anesthesia has decreased, while fatality associated with regional anesthesia increased from 1979 to 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A review of data from 1997 to 2002, which included 56 deaths, reported a nonsignificant difference in case fatality rates for general anesthesia compared with regional anesthesia during cesarean delivery (6.5 deaths per million versus 3.8 death per million, risk ratio 1.7, 95% CI 0.6 to 4.6).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4127783950\"><span class=\"h3\">Blood loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General anesthesia may be associated with greater blood loss during cesarean delivery compared with neuraxial anesthesia, without an increase in transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A metaanalysis of three randomized trials including 436 patients found that general anesthesia was associated with a modest increase in blood loss compared with neuraxial anesthesia (weighted mean difference 106 mL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A randomized controlled trial of 418 healthy parturients demonstrated overall slightly lower postoperative Hgb levels in the general anesthesia group when compared with neuraxial anesthesia (10.40&plusmn;1.39 versus 10.92&plusmn;1.24) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2365706136\"><span class=\"h3\">Neonatal effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The literature on the differences in neonatal outcome associated with the choice of anesthetic technique for cesarean delivery is inconclusive, but the overall difference between general anesthesia and neuraxial anesthesia is likely small. Apgar scores and umbilical acid base status may be affected by variables unrelated to the choice of anesthetic, including the indication for the cesarean delivery, vasopressors administered during anesthesia (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a>), surgical technical issues, and others. A metaanalysis of 22 randomized studies including 1800 patients who underwent cesarean delivery reported no difference in umbilical artery or vein pH during non-urgent cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Mean Apgar scores at one minute were higher with epidural than with general anesthesia, with no differences in five minute Apgar score between general and any type of neuraxial anesthesia.</p><p>Neonatal exposure to anesthetic drugs during induction and maintenance of general anesthesia can cause early neonatal depression.

The choice of anesthetic technique must be individualized, based on the clinical situation and patient factors. Possible contraindications to NA include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Coagulopathy </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Patients receiving anticoagulation therapy or patients with congenital or acquired disorders of platelets or coagulation may be at increased risk of spinal epidural hematoma with neuraxial anesthesia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypovolemia </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>NA results in sympathetic block and vasodilation, and may cause marked maternal hypotension in patients with severe hypovolemia (eg, ongoing hemorrhage, sepsis). (See <a href=\"#H840431840\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infection</strong> &ndash; Infection at the site of epidural or spinal placement is a contraindication to neuraxial anesthesia, whereas systemic bacterial infection is typically not if the patient is appropriately pretreated with antibiotics and is hemodynamically stable. Patients with systemic viral infections (eg, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], hepatitis B or C, influenza, herpes [secondary infection]) are often candidates for neuraxial anesthesia if they are receiving antiviral therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have low viral loads and are without other contraindications (eg, coagulopathy).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intracranial pathology </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Patients with non-communicating increased intracranial pressure (ICP) or obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow related to mass lesions may be at risk of cerebral herniation with dural puncture. Thus spinal and epidural anesthesia (which may result in inadvertent dural puncture) are relatively contraindicated in these patients. These patients may also be at risk for a transient, further increase in ICP with a bolus of epidural medication. These patients are best managed in consultation with a neurologist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbar-puncture-technique-indications-contraindications-and-complications-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbar puncture: Technique, indications, contraindications, and complications in adults&quot;, section on 'Cerebral herniation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with communicating increased ICP (ie, pseudotumor cerebri) are likely not at risk for herniation with dural puncture, but may experience a transient increase in ICP and symptoms with epidural injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spinal pathology </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>NA may be difficult, impossible, or contraindicated for some patients with abnormal spine anatomy, surgical fusion, or lesions within the spinal column.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2901698235\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of neuraxial anesthetic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comparison of NA techniques includes the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F110997\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110997 \">table 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spinal anesthesia</strong> &ndash; Spinal anesthesia is the most commonly used NA technique for cesarean delivery. Spinal anesthesia is usually performed more quickly than epidural anesthesia, and provides rapid onset of dense, bilateral, reliable anesthesia, using a very low dose of drug with minimal risk of maternal toxicity or fetal drug transfer. The duration of anesthesia is limited after single injection spinal, without the ability to extend anesthesia for unforeseen circumstances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Continuous spinal anesthesia (CSA) may be performed to allow slow titration of spinal anesthesia for parturients with some comorbidities (eg, significant cardiac lesions), or for patients in whom epidural placement may be difficult or ineffective for anatomic reasons (eg, patients who have had extensive spinal surgery). CSA is also a reasonable option after an unintentional dural puncture during attempted epidural catheter placement. In obstetric patients, the risk of post dural puncture headache is high when large gauge continuous spinal catheters (18 g or 19 g) are used, and limits the routine use of this technique.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epidural anesthesia</strong> &ndash; Epidural anesthesia is a catheter based, continuous technique, such that the onset can be titrated, and the duration extended, with incremental dosing. Labor epidural analgesia can be converted to a surgical level of epidural anesthesia if necessary. Epidural anesthesia tends to be less dense and reliable than spinal anesthesia, is less likely to adequately anesthetize sacral levels, and the onset is slower. This technique requires larger doses of drugs, increasing the risk of fetal drug exposure, also increasing the risk of maternal and fetal systemic toxicity if intravascular injection occurs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Combined spinal&ndash;epidural anesthesia </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Combined spinal&ndash;epidural (CSE) anesthesia provides the rapid onset and other advantages of spinal anesthesia and in addition, the option to extend and prolong anesthesia with the epidural catheter. With this technique, functionality of the epidural catheter is not verified until it is used. However, epidural catheters placed as part of CSE may be at least as reliable, or more so, than standalone epidural catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2645999084\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal anesthesia is the most commonly used neuraxial technique for scheduled cesarean delivery.

Patients with weak grip strength should be assessed continuously for block progression.

However, TAP blocks (or continuous TAP catheters) may be useful if neuraxial morphine is contraindicated, if the patient has a general anesthetic, or in patients with increased opioid tolerance. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">TAP blocks require injection of a large volume of LA, which is a particular concern in pregnant patients, who are at increased risk for LA toxicity.

Therefore, some practitioners advocate using an anatomically more posterior approach to allow a dose of LA at the lower end of the effective range and the use of dilute solutions of LA. There is no benefit to the use of high concentration LA for TAP block for post-cesarean delivery pain. A meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials that compared TAP blocks performed with low dose bupivacaine (&le;50 mg per side) or high dose bupivacaine (&gt;50 mg per side) with controls found that TAP blocks reduced postoperative opioid consumption, but there were no differences between low and high dose blocks in 24-hour opioid consumption, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), or maternal satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>].

For patients in whom either neuraxial or general anesthesia would be appropriate for cesarean delivery, neuraxial anesthesia is the preferred anesthetic technique. General anesthesia may be indicated for emergency cesarean delivery, for patients who cannot cooperate with neuraxial anesthesia, and for patients with contraindications to neuraxial anesthesia. (See <a href=\"#H1401256502\" class=\"local\">'General versus neuraxial anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who undergo elective or emergent cesarean delivery, pharmacologic aspiration prophylaxis should be considered. Options include sodium citrate, 30 mL by mouth immediately prior to anesthesia, an H2 receptor antagonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> 50 mg IV) 40 to 60 minutes prior to induction, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> 10 mg IV slowly 15 minutes prior to induction.

The spinal solution typically includes local anesthetic (LA) (eg, hyperbaric <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> 10 to 12 mg), lipophilic opioid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> 10 to 25 mcg) to improve intraoperative anesthesia, and hydrophilic opioid (eg, preservative-free <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> 75 to 200 mcg) for postoperative analgesia. (See <a href=\"#H1918283166\" class=\"local\">'Choice of spinal medication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidural anesthesia is often used for cesarean delivery for patients who have a labor epidural catheter in place. The epidural solution typically includes LA (eg, 2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> 1:200,000 with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>), lipophilic opioid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> 50 to 100 mcg) to improve intraoperative anesthesia, and hydrophilic opioid (eg, preservative free <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> 1 to 3 mg) for postoperative analgesia. (See <a href=\"#H2933915413\" class=\"local\">'Choice of epidural medication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For general anesthesia, our usual strategy is as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We perform rapid sequence induction and intubation. (See <a href=\"#H760109143\" class=\"local\">'Induction of anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>After induction, we administer high concentration of volatile anesthetic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desflurane</a>) to rapidly achieve 1 MAC end tidal anesthetic, along with 50 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> (100 percent oxygen if there is fetal distress). (See <a href=\"#H47957203\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance of general anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>After delivery, we administer opioid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> 100 mcg IV), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> 2 mg IV, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitrous oxide</a> 50 to 70 percent, and reduce the concentration of volatile anesthetic to 0.5 to 0.75 MAC.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be positioned with left uterine displacement to attempt to avoid aortocaval compression and supine hypotension. (See <a href=\"#H474795097\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative positioning'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a>, rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a>, to prevent and treat neuraxial block induced hypotension in the absence of maternal bradycardia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For healthy patients, we administer a prophylactic, low dose, titrated infusion of phenylephrine with phenylephrine rescue boluses, along with intravenous volume expansion (co-loading) with glucose free crystalloid solution, aiming for a baseline maternal blood pressure and asymptomatic for nausea and vomiting. (See <a href=\"#H840431840\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxytocin is administered to prevent postpartum hemorrhage using a variety of regimens, including bolus doses and infusions. Oxytocin should be administered slowly, in small doses (eg, &lt;3 units IV), and by infusion pump rather than free flow infusion. (See <a href=\"#H3570978273\" class=\"local\">'Prevention of postpartum hemorrhage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest a multimodal approach to postoperative analgesia after cesarean delivery, including neuraxial opioids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). A multimodal approach improves the quality of pain control and reduces the requirement for systemic opioids. Systemic opioids may be required when neuraxial opioids are not administered.
