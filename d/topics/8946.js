Its goals are to assess the stage of HIV disease, determine the risk for other infections, identify co-morbidities that are associated with HIV infection, and evaluate for the initiation and selection of antiretroviral therapy. In addition, the initial evaluation is an important time to establish the patient-practitioner relationship and educate the patient about the natural history and management of HIV infection. </p><p>This topic discusses the elements of the initial evaluation of patients with HIV infection. Primary care of the HIV-infected patient is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-care-of-the-hiv-infected-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary care of the HIV-infected adult&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H955927121\"><span class=\"h1\">GUIDELINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America has published guidelines on the primary care of HIV-infected individuals, which were last updated in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The recommendations discussed in this topic are generally consistent with these guidelines.</p><p>Links to recommendations by other expert groups, including the European AIDS Clinical Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], can be found in the society guideline links topic.

If these records are not available, repeat HIV antibody testing should be performed to confirm the diagnosis since cases of factitious HIV infection have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H955927212\" class=\"local\">'HIV serology'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H955927139\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with suspected HIV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients at high risk for HIV or those with symptoms or signs suggestive of acute or chronic infection should be tested. Routine HIV screening and diagnosis of acute HIV infection are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-and-diagnostic-testing-for-hiv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening and diagnostic testing for HIV infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-and-early-hiv-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H18410709\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute and early HIV infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H955927145\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comprehensive medical history should be performed during the initial visits with an HIV-infected patient. This should include an assessment of the duration and stage of HIV infection, the presence of comorbidities that might affect prognosis and the choice of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and the presence of epidemiologic factors that increase the risk of HIV transmission and acquisition of other infections. The evaluation should also assess the patient's understanding of his or her illness and issues of transmission. For patients who have already been in HIV care, a detailed assessment of any prior treatment is essential. In a newly diagnosed patient, assessment should also include review of the patient's emotional state and available social supports. Involvement of a specialized social worker (HIV case manager) may be useful in this setting.</p><p>Risk reduction counseling for HIV-infected patients is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-care-of-the-hiv-infected-adult#H70\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary care of the HIV-infected adult&quot;, section on 'Behavioral risk reduction counseling'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H955927151\"><span class=\"h2\">History of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the initial evaluation, the patient's history should include the following specific information:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk behaviors for HIV infection and their approximate year of onset</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of opportunistic infections (OIs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knowledge of initial and most recent CD4 cell counts and HIV viral load (RNA) results</p><p/><p>A thorough antiretroviral treatment history, including all prior regimens, CD4 count and viral load responses, and significant side effects <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> long-term toxicities, is important for future treatment considerations. Medical records are often required to confirm treatment histories and to document prior drug resistance testing as well as virologic and immunologic responses to therapy. Patients with newly diagnosed HIV infection should also be asked about any prior use of antiretroviral drugs for prevention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Administration of pre-exposure prophylaxis against HIV infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H955927157\"><span class=\"h2\">Past medical history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When taking a past medical history, clinicians should focus on the presence of common comorbidities, especially those that might affect the choice of ART or response to it. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-antiretroviral-regimens-for-the-treatment-naive-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting antiretroviral regimens for the treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Viral hepatitis</strong> &ndash; Coinfections with hepatitis B virus (HBV) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hepatitis C virus (HCV) are common in HIV-infected individuals given the shared routes of transmission. Liver disease tends to progress more rapidly in <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HBV</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/HCV-coinfected</span> patients compared with those with HCV or HBV infection alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Coinfection with HBV has important implications for antiretroviral drug choice as some agents (eg, tenofovir, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">emtricitabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>) have both anti-HIV and anti-HBV activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Intention to treat HCV also has implications for antiretroviral drug choice because of adverse drug-drug interactions with some regimens. Patient education regarding routes of acquisition of hepatitis B and C is also important. One study found that many patients who engaged in high risk behaviors (traumatic sex or injection drug use) did not perceive themselves to be at risk for viral hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

HIV-infected patients are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease after adjustment for traditional risk factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of cardiovascular disease and risk factors in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-cardiovascular-risk-including-dyslipidemia-in-the-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of cardiovascular risk (including dyslipidemia) in the HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tuberculosis</strong> &ndash; A history of tuberculosis (TB) or TB exposure should be sought, and results of prior testing for TB, if any, should be obtained. HIV infection is among the most significant risk factors for reactivation of latent TB, and HIV-infected patients with a history of latent TB are at high risk for developing active infection in the absence of prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Furthermore, HIV infection is a risk factor for accelerated TB progression and extrapulmonary involvement, especially in patients with advanced immune dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sexually transmitted infections</strong> &ndash; A history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and their treatment should be elicited, including a history of genital or anal warts and any abnormal cervical or anal cytology tests. STIs are common in HIV-infected patients given shared routes of transmission and may be associated with greater morbidity. As examples, human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cervical and anal dysplasia is common in HIV-infected patients, and its incidence is highest in those with advanced immune dysfunction. Similarly, herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection can reactivate more frequently in HIV-infected patients with a longer duration of symptoms than in immunocompetent hosts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-infections-epidemiology-and-disease-associations#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus infections: Epidemiology and disease associations&quot;, section on 'Effect of HIV infection on HPV'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In particular, a history of syphilis should be assessed, as the rate of syphilis has been rising, especially among HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The results of Papanicolaou (Pap) tests and mammograms, including any abnormal results, should be noted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-and-women#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV and women&quot;, section on 'Choice of contraception'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-and-women#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV and women&quot;, section on 'Abnormal cervical cytology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiretroviral and intrapartum management of pregnant HIV-infected women and their infants in resource-rich settings&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Malignancy</strong> &ndash; In the era of potent ART, there is an increased incidence of non-AIDS-defining malignancies contributing to overall mortality in HIV-infected persons. Patients should be interviewed about their history of smoking, family history of cancer, and any symptoms of malignancy (eg, weight loss, chronic cough, rectal bleeding). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-infection-and-malignancy-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H1560489307\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV infection and malignancy: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychiatric history</strong> &ndash; Psychiatric disorders, particularly depression, are very common in HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients should be asked about prior psychiatric diagnoses and be screened for depressive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Reliable studies examining the safety and efficacy of these therapies are lacking, and potential interactions with antiretroviral drugs (eg, St. John's wort with PIs) are a concern.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H955927169\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunization history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete immunization history should be obtained, including dates of pneumococcal vaccines and tetanus toxoid. Additionally, a prior history of hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines should be sought with documentation of protective antibody response. Although guidelines have been in place since 1999 regarding the importance of hepatitis A and B vaccination among HIV-infected patients, studies of outpatient HIV clinics continue to document low rates of screening and immunization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

A thorough travel history is also essential. Patients may be at risk for certain reactivation infections (eg, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis) based upon their current and past geographic exposure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Substance use</strong> &ndash; A discussion of past and current substance use is extremely important. Ongoing injection drug use can lead to transmission of HIV infection to others, as well as increase the risk of acquisition of HCV and other blood-borne pathogens.

Cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, and heavy alcohol use can contribute to high-risk sexual activities and thereby increase the risk of HIV transmission to others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H955927181\"><span class=\"h2\">Family history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A family history of coronary artery disease (specifically in a first-degree relative before the age of 55 years for male relatives and 65 years for female relatives), diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and malignancies should be sought.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H955927187\"><span class=\"h2\">Review of systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The review of systems should elicit any constitutional symptoms, such as fevers, night sweats, and weight loss, as well as localized complaints. Patients with advanced immunosuppression should specifically be questioned about common HIV-related symptoms and signs such as new visual floaters, change in vision, thrush, <span class=\"nowrap\">dysphagia/</span> odynophagia, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea, skin rash, headache, inability to concentrate, muscle weakness, or paresthesias.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H955927193\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comprehensive physical examination, including weight and height, should be performed as part of the initial evaluation. Certain physical exam findings are common or important to assess in the HIV-infected patient, particularly in the setting of advanced immunosuppression:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skin</strong> &ndash; Skin findings that have been associated with HIV infection include seborrheic dermatitis, eosinophilic folliculitis, psoriasis, superficial fungal disease, molluscum contagiosum, herpes simplex, herpes zoster, and Kaposi's sarcoma (KS).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Body morphology </strong>&ndash; Assessment for fat redistribution should be performed with careful notation of areas of fat atrophy (eg, malar atrophy, thinning of extremities or buttocks) or fat deposition (eg, prominent cervicodorsal fat pad, visceral adiposity). Patient self-report and physician identification of body fat maldistribution may be supplemented by anthropometric measurements (skin fold, waist, and hip).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Eyes </strong>&ndash; Patients with advanced immunosuppression are at risk for cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. Some specialists advise ophthalmologic referral for dilated funduscopic exam to screen for CMV retinitis in patients with advanced HIV infection (CD4 cell count &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Its goals are to assess the stage of HIV disease, determine the risk for other infections, identify co-morbidities that are associated with HIV infection, and evaluate for the initiation and selection of antiretroviral therapy (ART). (See <a href=\"#H955927115\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A comprehensive medical history should be performed during the initial visits with an HIV-infected patient. This should include discussion of risk factors for and history of HIV infection, any prior treatment history, and the presence of potential comorbidities that are common in HIV-infected populations, such as viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections, and tuberculosis, as well as risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The evaluation should also assess the patient's understanding of his or her illness and issues of transmission. (See <a href=\"#H955927145\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physical examination should be attentive to potential complications that can occur in patients with advanced immunosuppression (eg, thrush) or with long-standing HIV infection (eg, fat redistribution). In particular, examination of the skin, oral mucosa, lymph nodes, and anogenital region is often revealing in patients with advanced HIV infection. (See <a href=\"#H955927193\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial laboratory testing should include assessment of HIV staging parameters (CD4 cell count, HIV RNA, HIV genotype test) along with baseline testing of organ function and screening for potential coinfections, such as viral hepatitis, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted infections including HPV-related neoplasia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F96776\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96776 \">table 1</a>).
