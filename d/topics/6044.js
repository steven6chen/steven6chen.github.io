We agree with the American Society for Reproductive Medicine Practice Committee statement that &quot;endometriosis should be viewed as a chronic disease that requires a lifelong management plan with the goal of maximizing the use of medical treatment and avoiding repeated surgical procedures&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Prior to treatment, all women should have a thorough history and examination. Other sources of pelvic pain are eliminated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of chronic pelvic pain in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H402664116\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our treatment plan is based on the severity of the patient's endometriosis-related pain. As noted above, other causes of pelvic pain are excluded. We aim to manage the patient's pain with medical therapy for as long as possible and thus limit the number of surgical interventions.</p><p>For women with mild to moderate pain (eg, pain symptoms that do not cause regular absence from school or work) and no ultrasound evidence of an endometrioma, we prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71912\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71912 \">table 1</a>) and continuous hormonal contraceptives (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69223\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69223 \">table 2</a>) as the first line of treatment because these therapies are low-risk, have few side effects, and provide relief of symptoms for many women. Women who desire pregnancy can use NSAIDs, although we avoid selective COX-2 inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>, rofecoxib, and valdecoxib) as some studies indicate these drugs can prevent or delay ovulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Management of women with an endometrioma is presented separately. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Endometrioma'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Management of ovarian endometriomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While this approach is supported by recommendations from major societies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/1,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6</a>], there are no data supporting superiority of one NSAID or hormonal contraceptive over another. Selection is based on patient preference, availability, and cost.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women without medical <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/contraception/pdf/summary-chart-us-medical-eligibility-criteria_508tagged.pdf&amp;token=jEVGVo6WqsDq698K1C6vDPPjIqTfzg54vW4qWS3doblDMO+X3NN/ro6R0xwK/I6IOwBh6DyNhV/q6vrv3T8nCaRCrZsEC+Wz9FPYFmXFzWEhd9uzeVTKQGeWKf6mT23Z1X5qsRVoFq27I5l+8ZoObQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=7383\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">contraindications</a>, we prefer combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives (pill, patch, or vaginal ring) combined with an NSAID. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Estrogen-progestin contraceptives'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who cannot or choose not to use estrogen therapy, we prescribe progestin-only contraceptive pills (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> 0.35 mg taken once daily) with an NSAID. (See <a href=\"#H57629772\" class=\"local\">'Progestins'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>We reassess the woman's symptoms after three to four months of combined treatment. Women with adequate symptom improvement are continued on the hormonal <span class=\"nowrap\">therapy/NSAID</span> regimen until pregnancy is desired or the average age of menopause is reached. Women whose symptoms do not improve continue NSAID treatment and are offered a different hormonal combination (eg, other estrogen-progestin contraceptive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69223\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69223 \">table 2</a>), oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> acetate 5 mg taken once daily, gestrinone 2.5 mg orally twice weekly [not available in the United States]) or depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> 150 mg intramuscularly every three months. There are no data supporting superiority of one therapy over another. Again, drug selection is based on patient preference, availability, and cost. If the alternative hormonal treatment resolves symptoms, then this regimen is continued until pregnancy is desired or the patient reaches the average age of menopause. While we believe this approach of hormonal suppression and NSAID therapy is the preferred first-line treatment for women with mild to moderate symptoms, it is important to note that initial treatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is a reasonable alternative used by some experts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progestin-only-pills-pops-for-contraception#H15275506\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Progestin-only pills (POPs) for contraception&quot;, section on 'Norethindrone'</a> and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists'</a> below.)</p><p>Women with severe symptoms (eg, regularly missing school or work because of pain), symptoms that do not respond to the above therapies, or recurrent symptoms are offered a trial of GnRH agonist with add-back hormonal therapy or laparoscopy for diagnosis and treatment (if they have not already done so). Add-back hormonal therapy limits hypoestrogenic side effects (eg, hot flashes, vaginal dryness) and preserves bone density. GnRH agonist with add-back therapy can be used long-term. Similar to society recommendations, we start the GnRH therapy and the add-back simultaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. This strategy limits bone loss, improves vasomotor symptoms, and improves compliance without reducing efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/1,7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7-10</a>].</p><p>We reserve treatment with aromatase inhibitors for women who continue to have refractory symptoms despite GnRH agonist treatment because there is less data on long-term use of these agents for endometriosis treatment. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-long-term-treatment-with-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-agonists#H207353414\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Long-term treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists&quot;, section on 'GnRH with add-back therapy'</a> and <a href=\"#H56701837\" class=\"local\">'Aromatase inhibitors'</a> below.)</p><p>Women whose pain does not respond to the above medical treatment are offered laparoscopy for diagnosis and treatment. Excision of endometrial implants, endometriomas, and adhesions is performed at the time of surgery. Surgical intervention may be conservative (retain uterus and ovarian tissue) or definitive (removal of the uterus and possibly the ovaries in women who have completed childbearing), depending on the woman's child-bearing plans and age. After surgery, hormonal suppression (usually with continuous oral contraceptives) is started to prevent recurrence of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H11364317\" class=\"local\">'Surgical treatment options'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-surgical-management-of-pelvic-pain#H29195228\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Surgical management of pelvic pain&quot;, section on 'Postoperative care'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL TREATMENT OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical treatment options include nonsteroidal analgesics, hormonal contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, and aromatase inhibitors. As there are no data supporting one treatment or treatment combination over another, the treatment choice is based upon symptom severity, patient preferences, medication side effects, treatment efficacy, contraceptive needs, costs, and availability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H402664116\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p>The general advantages and disadvantages of medical treatment of endometriosis-related pelvic pain are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69477\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69477 \">table 3</a>). Of note, medical interventions do not improve fertility, diminish endometriomas, or treat complications of deep endometriosis such as ureteral obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/5,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11</a>]. Women with these problems proceed with therapy targeted at the specific problem. (See <a href=\"#H58293678\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of special populations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) effectively treat primary dysmenorrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71912\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71912 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. NSAIDs are be considered the first-line treatment for pelvic pain, including endometriosis-related pain. However, there are no high-quality data reporting NSAID efficacy in treating pain due to endometriosis, nor have NSAIDs been shown to be superior to other agents or to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Use of NSAIDs is based on their ready availability, low cost, acceptable side-effect profile, and trial data consistently demonstrating effective reduction of primary dysmenorrhea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-primary-dysmenorrhea-in-adult-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of primary dysmenorrhea in adult women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While NSAIDs are commonly combined with a contraceptive hormonal therapy, women who desire conception can use NSAIDs alone. For women attempting conception, we avoid selective COX-2 inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>, rofecoxib, and valdecoxib) as some studies indicate these drugs can prevent or delay ovulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Estrogen-progestin contraceptives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combined (estrogen and progestin) contraceptives are the first-line treatment for most women with endometriosis-related pain because they can be used long-term, are well-tolerated, are relatively inexpensive and easy to use, and provide contraception and additional benefits including decreasing the risk of ovarian and endometrial cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Combined estrogen-progestin treatments include combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs), transdermal patches, and vaginal rings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69223\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69223 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/5,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,15,16</a>].</p><p>As no formulation has demonstrated superiority, we typically begin with a COC containing 20 mcg of ethinyl <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> given in a continuous dose fashion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69223\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69223 \">table 2</a>). While both cyclic and continuous-dose hormonal regimens appear to be effective at reducing endometriosis-related pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], two systematic reviews (one with meta-analysis) reported that continuous COC regimens were more effective at reducing pain symptoms than cyclic COC regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19</a>]. Additionally, one trial reported that the efficacy of COC treatment was equivalent to GnRH treatment (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=goserelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">goserelin</a>) at reducing pelvic pain, but the trial was limited by small sample size (57 women) and relatively short duration (12 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraceptive-counseling-and-selection#H12170197\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraceptive counseling and selection&quot;, section on 'Method selection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hormonal contraception for suppression of menstruation&quot;, section on 'Extended and continuous use of contraceptive pills'</a>.)</p><p>Estrogen-progestin contraceptives are thought to suppress ovarian function and thereby reduce endometriosis disease activity and pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The purported therapeutic mechanism is decidualization and subsequent atrophy of endometrial tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In addition, estrogen-progestin contraceptives may slow progression of disease, although evidence is conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/17,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,23</a>].</p><p>Risks and side effects of estrogen-progestin contraceptives are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-and-side-effects-associated-with-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks and side effects associated with estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57629772\"><span class=\"h2\">Progestins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with endometriosis-related pain who are unable to take or prefer to avoid combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives, progestin-only therapy is another treatment option. The progestins most commonly used for the treatment of endometriosis-related pain include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> (MPA) or the 19-nortestosterone derivatives <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> acetate and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dienogest-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dienogest</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. In systematic reviews of progestin therapy for pain associated with endometriosis, MPA and dienogest were superior to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. To treat endometriosis-related pain, depot MPA can be given as 150 mg intramuscular injection every three months or as a 104 mg subcutaneous injection every three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Dienogest can be prescribed as a 2 mg oral pill taken daily or combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estradiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">estradiol</a> valerate as part of a multi-phasic oral contraceptive pill (commercial name Natazia, only formulation available in United States, and cannot be used in women with contraindications to estrogen treatment) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A commonly used regimen of norethindrone acetate is 5 mg by mouth daily, but the dose can range from 2.5 mg to 15 mg daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In our practice, we reserve dienogest for women who do not tolerate norethindrone acetate because the treatment outcomes appear to be similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] but norethindrone acetate is less expensive.</p><p>Progestins (synthetic progestogens) inhibit endometrial tissue growth by causing initial decidualization and then atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Additional proposed mechanisms of action include suppression of matrix metalloproteinases, a class of enzymes important in the growth and implantation of ectopic endometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and inhibition of angiogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The choice of progestin depends upon the contraceptive needs of the patient, side-effect profile of the various drugs, and patient preference. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progestin-only-pills-pops-for-contraception\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Progestin-only pills (POPs) for contraception&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate for contraception&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Progestin-only treatments have several advantages compared with other medical therapies. Progestin-only treatment avoids the estrogen-related thromboembolic risk seen with estrogen-containing contraceptives. Compared with the GnRH agonists, high-dose oral progestin treatment is not associated with bone loss and is less expensive. Compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a>, progestins are better tolerated, have no androgenic side effects, and have a less detrimental impact on lipids. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1694486511\" class=\"local\">'Danazol'</a> below.)</p><p>Side effects of progestin treatment can include irregular uterine <span class=\"nowrap\">bleeding/spotting,</span> amenorrhea (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=dienogest-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dienogest</a>), weight gain, mood changes (eg, depression), and bone loss (specific to long-term use of depot MPA). Additionally, long-term use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> acetate can lead to a significant reduction in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and significant increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides; lipid levels are monitored in patients on long-term therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Unlike GnRH agonists, these agents are effective immediately, do not cause an initial surge in luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone, and do not require 7 to 14 days for GnRH suppression. They are available in both oral and injectable forms. The GnRH antagonist induces a dose-dependent hypoestrogenic state to inhibit endometriotic cell proliferation. Symptom relief and adverse events such as vasomotor phenomena, vaginal atrophy, and bone loss are also dose-dependent. GnRH antagonists provide a treatment option for women who do not respond to NSAIDs, estrogen-progestin contraceptives, or progestins, and they are easier to dose than GnRH agonists (oral versus intramuscular). </p><p>In two phase-three trials comparing two different doses of the oral GnRH antagonist elagolix (150 mg once daily or 200 mg twice daily) with placebo on endometriosis-related dysmenorrhea and non-cyclic pelvic pain, women in both elagolix groups reported significantly reduced symptoms at three months of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In both trials, at three months, meaningful reductions in dysmenorrhea pain were reported by about 44 percent of the low-dose elagolix group, 74 percent of the high-dose elagolix group, and 21 percent of the placebo group. Nonmenstrual pelvic pain was decreased in 50, 56, and 36 percent of women in the low-dose, high-dose, and placebo groups, respectively. At six months, these responses persisted compared with placebo. Also at six months, mean changes from baseline in lumbar spine bone density were about -0.5, -2.6, and +0.5 percent in the low-dose, high-dose, and placebo groups, respectively. The improvement in dysmenorrhea in the low-dose elagolix group is modest compared with the approved GnRH agonist, depot-leuprolide acetate. While 72 percent or more of women in all three groups noted an adverse event, the side effect-driven discontinuation rates were 10 percent in both treatment and placebo groups. Women in the treatment groups reported significantly more hot flushes (mostly mild to moderate), headache, and insomnia and had higher serum lipids levels (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides) compared with women receiving placebo. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1694486511\"><span class=\"h2\">Danazol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danazol</a> is effective at treating endometriosis-related pain, it is not commonly used because of androgenic side effects. In a systematic review of five trials, all of which included women with surgically diagnosed endometriosis, six months of danazol treatment was more effective than placebo in relieving endometriosis-related pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on &quot;patient info&quot; and the keyword(s) of interest.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basics topic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Endometriosis (The Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beyond the Basics topic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Endometriosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endometriosis is a chronic disease that requires a lifelong management plan that maximizes medical treatment and avoids repeat surgical intervention. Each treatment plan takes into account the clinical presentation, symptom severity, disease extent and location, reproductive desires, patient age, medication side effects, surgical complication rates, and cost. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our approach to treating endometriosis-related pain treatment is based on the severity of symptoms. Other causes of pelvic pain are excluded prior to treatment. (See <a href=\"#H402664116\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with mild to moderate pain, we suggest nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71912\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71912 \">table 1</a>) and continuous hormonal contraceptives (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69223\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69223 \">table 2</a>) rather than either agent alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). These therapies are low-risk, have few side effects, are low-cost, and are generally well-tolerated compared with other medical therapies. Women who wish to conceive can use the NSAID alone. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Estrogen-progestin contraceptives'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women with adequate symptom improvement continue the hormonal <span class=\"nowrap\">therapy/NSAID</span> regimen until pregnancy is desired or the average age of menopause is reached. Women whose symptoms do not improve continue NSAID treatment and are offered an alternate hormonal combination (eg, change to a different estrogen-progestin contraceptive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69223\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69223 \">table 2</a>) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> acetate). (See <a href=\"#H402664116\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For women with severe symptoms, symptoms that do not respond to the above therapies, or recurrent symptoms, we suggest a trial of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist with add-back hormonal therapy rather than surgical resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). GnRH agonist treatment has demonstrated efficacy without the risks or negative impact on ovarian reserve of surgery. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women who continue to have refractory symptoms despite GnRH agonist treatment are offered medical therapy with an aromatase inhibitor. (See <a href=\"#H56701837\" class=\"local\">'Aromatase inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women whose pain does not respond to the above treatments are offered laparoscopy for confirmation of the diagnosis and surgical resection. (See <a href=\"#H402664116\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H698359140\" class=\"local\">'Surgical resection of endometriosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with endometriosis-associated infertility, treatment involves a combination of expectant management, surgery, and assisted reproduction techniques. Medical therapy is ineffective. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Infertility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with symptomatic or expanding endometriomas, laparoscopic excision is performed to treat the associated pain, confirm the diagnosis, exclude malignancy, and prevent complications, such as rupture or torsion requiring emergency surgery. For women with asymptomatic or small (&le;5 cm) endometriomas, the lesions are left in place because surgical excision can decrease ovarian reserve. Medical therapy does not treat endometriomas. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Endometrioma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with bothersome urinary or bowel symptoms (eg, urinary <span class=\"nowrap\">urgency/frequency,</span> dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, or dyschezia) suggestive of deep endometriosis, medical therapy with hormonal suppression is appropriate. Surgery is indicated for women with ureteral or bowel obstruction or women whose symptoms do not improve with medical management. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Deep endometriosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with symptomatic endometriosis of extra-pelvic organs, we prefer ovarian suppression with GnRH analogs because they are highly effective at suppressing ovarian hormone production and inhibiting the growth of endometrial tissue. (See <a href=\"#H1775021786\" class=\"local\">'Lesions of nonreproductive organs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with pain from presumed endometriosis, we begin empiric medical therapy with NSAIDs and hormonal suppression because these treatments are low-risk. However, we prefer to confirm endometriosis with laparoscopy before initiating medication with significant side effects. (See <a href=\"#H3097268873\" class=\"local\">'Presumed endometriosis'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
