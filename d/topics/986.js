However, prenatal depression is not associated with adverse effects upon intelligence in the children. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2525203056\"><span class=\"h2\">General cognitive functioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A review found that prenatal depression is associated with diminished general cognitive performance in the children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antenatal-depression-risks-of-cognitive-impairment-and-psychopathology-in-the-offspring/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As an example, a prospective study reported that high levels of antenatal depressive symptoms were associated with decreased cognitive performance in children at age 18 months (n = 223), and the effect appeared to be independent of postnatal depressive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antenatal-depression-risks-of-cognitive-impairment-and-psychopathology-in-the-offspring/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>However, the review also concluded that the magnitude of the association between antenatal depression and diminished cognition in the offspring is small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antenatal-depression-risks-of-cognitive-impairment-and-psychopathology-in-the-offspring/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, mild to moderate antenatal depression, which is often not treated with pharmacotherapy, may not be associated with cognitive impairment in the children. One prospective study included offspring (n = 27) of women with antenatal major depression who were not treated with antidepressants, and offspring (n = 98) of women without antenatal depression or exposure to antidepressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antenatal-depression-risks-of-cognitive-impairment-and-psychopathology-in-the-offspring/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

As an example, a prospective study followed a community cohort of mother-child dyads (nearly 8000) for up to 14 years, and controlled for potential confounding factors (such as obstetric outcomes [eg, birth weight and gestational age], parenting behavior, and postnatal depression) in the analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antenatal-depression-risks-of-cognitive-impairment-and-psychopathology-in-the-offspring/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

In addition, the adverse effects persisted at age 13 years.
