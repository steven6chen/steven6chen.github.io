Unfortunately, there are many myths and misconceptions about what may or may not be ethical and legal in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In the United States, fear of litigation may prompt unnecessary interventions or hinder clinicians from acting completely ethically when they are faced with a patient with life-threatening illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. One study found that as many as 93 percent of clinicians in high-risk medical specialties (ie, emergency medicine, general surgery, orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, <span class=\"nowrap\">obstetrics/gynecology,</span> and radiology) report practicing defensive medicine in that they did testing beyond what they felt was clinically necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Acting in a manner that does not comply with the law can have serious consequences for both the patient and physician. Negative consequences for patients include receiving unwanted treatment or not receiving treatment that is wanted. Both scenarios could potentially result in civil and criminal sanctions for physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Importantly, the mere absence of explicit legal authorization for an action does not mean that action is prohibited. Medicine remains a largely self-regulated profession. There is comparatively more law regarding end of life care. But, the law does not and cannot directly address all interventions and procedures.</p><p>Understanding the legal aspects of end of life care should give the practicing clinician the confidence and freedom to act ethically and reasonably. Some of the legal standards regarding end of life care in the United States vary by state, but there are specific legal precedents surrounding end of life care that generalize. When in doubt, clinicians should consider an ethics consultation, seek legal counsel, or seek assistance from risk management.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Different hospitals will have different structures and roles for these different departments. Most hospitals have an ethics consultation service available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This service helps clinicians navigate conflict and uncertainty and helps determine which actions should or should not be taken. Many of the issues most frequently handled by ethics consultants are end of life issues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethical-issues-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethical issues in palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care: Medically futile and potentially inappropriate therapies of questionable benefit&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethical-issues-in-the-care-of-the-patient-with-end-stage-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethical issues in the care of the patient with end-stage renal disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethics-in-the-intensive-care-unit-responding-to-requests-for-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethics in the intensive care unit: Responding to requests for potentially inappropriate therapies in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The legal department exists to ensure that the hospital operates in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Most hospital lawyers focus on issues other than patient care. For example, business attorneys are responsible for the negotiation of business transactions and the preparation of documents and agreements related to business, corporate, and real estate matters. Other attorneys focus on matters such as labor and employment, litigation, and privacy. Typically, at least one attorney specializes in matters directly related to patient care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast to the legal department, risk management is more focused on patient care and ethics issues. Risk management may be an independent department, or it may be part of the legal department. Like ethics consultants, risk managers frequently are not attorneys. Because risk management is responsible for identifying, evaluating, and addressing not only actual but also potential risk, they are eager to proactively learn of situations that might present conflict or patient safety issues.</p><p/><p>This topic review will discuss issues related to legal aspects of end of life care that are specific to the United States. These may not apply outside the United States, although many of the principles are becoming more widely accepted. Ethical issues regarding end of life care, euthanasia, and physician-assisted suicide, ethical issues in the intensive care unit, and topics related to medical futility, advance care planning, and advance directives are discussed separately.

Over centuries, clinicians have developed ethical norms regarding care of the dying, including the withdrawal and withholding of life-sustaining treatments. </p><p>The first suggestion that clinicians should withhold medical interventions from terminally ill patients in some circumstances probably dates to Hippocrates&rsquo; injunction &ldquo;to refuse to treat those (patients) who are overmastered by their disease, realizing that in such cases medicine is powerless&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Subsequently, clinicians and religious leaders also have argued that withholding care from dying patients may be appropriate in some situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 1835, Jacob Bigelow urged fellow members of the Massachusetts Medical Society to withhold &ldquo;therapies,&rdquo; such as cathartics and emetics, from hopelessly ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 1848, John Warren, the surgeon who performed the first operation with ether anesthesia, urged that ether should be used &ldquo;in mitigating the agonies of death&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 1958, Pope Pius XII, in response to questions about resuscitating patients and maintaining comatose patients on respirators, stated that clinicians had no obligation to use such &ldquo;extraordinary&rdquo; means to forestall death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">THE RIGHT TO REFUSE MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to 1976, legal cases in the United States involving the refusal of life-sustaining medical care usually involved Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses. These decisions were justified based upon the First Amendment&rsquo;s right of religious freedom.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3198409630\"><span class=\"h2\">The Quinlan case</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1976, this changed with the Quinlan case. In that case, 21-year-old Karen Ann Quinlan suffered two 15-minute-long apneic periods, probably related to intoxication with alcohol and drugs. While her friends had attempted resuscitation, she was comatose when she arrived at the hospital and, one year later, was in a persistent vegetative state requiring respiratory support and artificial feedings. After consulting with his priest, Quinlan&rsquo;s father wanted her to be taken off the ventilator. Initially, his request was denied. But, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the right to privacy includes a right to refuse medical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]; this right extends to incompetent patients, and the right can be exercised on their behalf by their legal guardian. Importantly, the court held that decisions to withdraw medical treatments, at least when there is consensus among clinician and families, does not require going to court but can be handled by hospital ethics committees, clinicians, and families.</p><p>Karen Ann Quinlan was taken off the ventilator and was able to breathe on her own. She was kept alive for nine more years with artificial nutrition and hydration.</p><p>The Quinlan case changed the focus in cases of treatment refusal from a right of religious freedom to a person&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;right to die.&rdquo; Throughout the last part of the 1970s and 1980s, many state courts, particularly in California, Florida, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, established the legal norms for terminating life-sustaining treatment. Nearly 15 years of rulings at the state level were solidified when the United States Supreme Court decided the Cruzan case in 1990; this case was very similar to the Quinlan case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2708593347\"><span class=\"h2\">The Cruzan case</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nancy Beth Cruzan was 31 years old when she was in an automobile accident; this resulted in severe brain damage that placed her in a persistent vegetative state dependent upon a feeding tube. After four years without improvement in her cognitive function, her family asked to have her artificial feeding and hydration stopped. In its decision, the United States Supreme Court recognized that competent patients have a constitutional right to refuse medical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Using the Fifth Amendment&rsquo;s guarantee that no person shall &ldquo;be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law&rdquo; the Supreme Court affirmed patients&rsquo; rights to refuse medical treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The court declared that artificial hydration or nutrition is no different from other medical interventions. Although mentally incapacitated patients have the same right, the Supreme Court allowed states to impose restrictions on how explicit and specific the patient&rsquo;s prior wishes had to be [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>After this court ruling, some of Cruzan&rsquo;s friends provided evidence that she had previously expressed wishes that she would not want artificial feedings to be continued in such a scenario. As a result of this testimony, her feedings were terminated.</p><p>Mentally competent patients need not be terminally ill to exercise this right to refuse interventions; they have the right regardless of health status. In addition, the right applies equally to withholding proposed treatments and to discontinuing initiated treatments. Of note, this right to refuse medical care does not imply a correlative right to demand treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>The Cruzan case established a constitutionally protected liberty interest in refusing medical treatment, which has been referenced in more recent appellate court decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In theory, as noted by the Cruzan case, the right of patients to refuse medical therapy can be limited by four countervailing state interests in [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preservation of life</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of suicide</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protection of third parties such as children</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preserving the integrity of the medical profession</p><p/><p>In practice, these interests almost never override the right of competent patients and incompetent terminally ill patients who have left explicit advance directives.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1895465206\"><span class=\"h2\">The Schiavo case</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1990, 27-year-old Theresa Marie &ldquo;Terri&rdquo; Schiavo suffered cardiopulmonary arrest in her home, leading to a persistent vegetative state requiring artificial nutrition and hydration by feeding tube. After eight years without neurologic recovery, her husband and guardian requested that her feeding tube be removed, but her parents objected, and the case went to court. In 2000, a Florida circuit judge determined that there was &ldquo;clear and convincing evidence&rdquo; that she would not have wanted to be kept alive in this state. Therefore, clinicians should honor the request of Schiavo&rsquo;s husband to remove her feeding tube.</p><p>Despite several additional attempts on the part of Schiavo&rsquo;s parents to prevent removal of her feeding tube, including claims that she could recover, in 2004 the Florida Supreme Court affirmed that her husband could exercise her right and discontinue treatments, since that was consistent with her wishes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The United States Supreme Court stood by the lower court&rsquo;s decision and refused to hear the case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>This consistent refusal to intervene on behalf of Schiavo&rsquo;s parents&rsquo; desire to continue nutrition and hydration is reaffirmation of the right to refuse medical care, even for mentally incapacitated patients, and reaffirmation that artificial nutrition and hydration are medical treatments.</p><p>The right to refuse medical care is a right explicitly granted to patients by health care decisions acts in almost every state. Incapacitated patients can refuse nutrition and hydration through an instructional advance directive (a living will), through a Physician Order for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST), or by the direction of their surrogate. But, with respect to those surrogates not appointed by the patient him or herself, some states impose some limitations on the surrogate&rsquo;s authority to withhold or withdraw nutrition and hydration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN BE STOPPED</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Every medical intervention, including artificial nutrition and hydration, may be terminated at the patient&rsquo;s request. Specific legal cases have sanctioned the withholding or withdrawal of respirators, chemotherapy, blood transfusions, hemodialysis, and major surgical operations. In the Cruzan case, the United States Supreme Court definitively stated that artificial nutrition and hydration are medical interventions that can be withheld or withdrawn under the guidelines that apply to other medical treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Many patients who want to hasten their death are neither eligible for physician-assisted dying (PAD, also known as medical assistance in dying [MAID]) nor dependent upon any life-sustaining treatment. These patients have increasingly turned to voluntarily stopping eating and drinking (VSED). While patients have a right to refuse even interventions that do not constitute health care, some clinicians are reluctant to support VSED without direct, clear, and authoritative permission. Again, the absence of express legal permission is not the same as legal prohibition. Still, uncertainty remains. No statute, appellate case, agency regulation, or even medical society policy statement provides authorization or guidance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life#H2443404\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stopping nutrition and hydration at the end of life&quot;, section on 'Voluntary stopping of eating and drinking'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3466130925\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED DYING AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO WITHHOLDING TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physician-assisted dying (PAD, also referred to as medical aid in dying [MAID]) refers to the physician&rsquo;s act of providing medication, a prescription, or other interventions to a patient with the understanding that the patient intends to use them to hasten their death. Literature and practice also refer to PAD as physician-assisted death and, increasingly less commonly, physician-assisted suicide. &#160; </p><p>Outside of the United States, PAD is legal in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Luxemburg, Columbia, and Canada (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F101012\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101012 \">table 1</a>).

The court ruled in all three cases that decisions about PAD are properly left to the &ldquo;laboratory of the states.&rdquo; The court declined to rule that PAD was either required or prohibited by federal law:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the 1997 case Washington versus Glucksberg, several physicians counseling patients at the end of life challenged a state law banning PAD on the grounds that the Constitution guarantees the liberty of a consenting, terminally ill adult to PAD. The Supreme Court ruled that a state could ban PAD because such a ban is &ldquo;rationally related to a legitimate government interest,&rdquo; namely preserving human life and upholding the integrity and ethics of the medical profession. Thus, the court held that individuals do not have a constitutional right to PAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The majority view, written by Chief Justice Rehnquist, drew a distinction between the right to withdraw or withhold life-sustaining treatments as a liberty interest in being free of unwanted bodily invasion versus the right to PAD, which does not contain a liberty interest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/10,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the 1997 case Vacco versus Quill, the court maintained that there is a rational basis for a distinction between laws allowing doctors to withhold medical treatment and laws permitting PAD. As stated by the decision, &ldquo;The law has long used actors&rsquo; intent or purpose to distinguish between two acts that may have the same result&hellip;a physician who withdraws, or honors a patient&rsquo;s refusal to begin, life-sustaining medical treatment purposefully intends or may so intend, only to respect his patient's wishes&hellip;A doctor who assists a suicide, however, &lsquo;must, necessarily and indubitably, intend primarily that the patient be made dead&rsquo;&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While the court has not held that individuals have a constitutional right to PAD, it has not overturned state laws allowing this practice.

Even in cases where the patient&rsquo;s wishes may conflict with those of his or her family, the patient&rsquo;s right to refuse care is determinative. For mentally incapacitated patients who left living wills or other advance care documents, the wishes in these directives are also definitive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H312990922\"><span class=\"h2\">Distinguishing capacity and competence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are presumed to have capacity until that presumption is rebutted. Determining that a patient lacks capacity requires neither a formal legal proceeding nor a psychiatric evaluation. Instead, it can be done by clinicians.

Even though a patient may lack capacity to make some decisions, he or she may still retain the capacity to make others.</p><p>In contrast, competence is distinct in two ways.

In this situation, the first step is trying to determine if the patient is able to make some decisions for him or herself. A patient may have the capacity to express <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> values and preferences and make decisions regarding treatment even if <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> is unable to carry out other functions of higher reasoning, such as balancing <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> checkbook or living independently. On the other hand, a patient without capacity may seem intact in superficial conversation but be unable to make decisions regarding <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> medical care on <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> own preferences and values. If not, the next step would be to determine whether <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> made any previous instructions for their care. If a patient does not have the mental capacity to make medical decisions and there are no prior instructions, a surrogate decision maker should be identified.

Of those lacking decision-making capacity, around one-third did not have advance planning directives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Arguably, if patients left sufficiently clear and complete instructional advance directives (living wills), there would be no need for surrogates. Providers could simply consult the patient&rsquo;s own prior instructions for guidance. However, more than three decades of experience shows that it is difficult to effectively implement this form of advance planning and decision-making. Most individuals do not complete advance directives. Most of those that are completed are not available when needed. Even when completed and available, instructional advance directives are almost never sufficiently clear and detailed to obviously apply to the patient&rsquo;s current situation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

If a patient does not have the mental capacity to make medical decisions, a surrogate decision maker should be identified.

This appointment can be made through a legal form typically referred to as an advance directive, or a durable power of attorney for health care (DPAHC). While relatively short and simple, these appointment forms require the strict observation of certain formalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. For example, many states require the individual to sign the form before a notary public or in the presence of two witnesses who are neither related to the individual nor employed at a facility where the individual is a patient or resident.</p><p>The agent&rsquo;s power is often referred to as &ldquo;springing&rdquo; because it is triggered when the patient loses capacity and it vanishes when the patient regains capacity. Whenever authorized to act, the agent typically has the right to make all health care decisions that the patient could have made for him or herself, unless the patient has explicitly limited the agent&rsquo;s authority. Physicians must comply with decisions made in good faith by an agent to the same extent they would have to comply with decisions made by the patient his or herself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

A court-appointed surrogate is typically referred to as a &ldquo;guardian&rdquo; or &ldquo;conservator.&rdquo; After the appointment, the court is supposed to supervise and monitor the guardian&rsquo;s choices on behalf of the patient to ensure that the patient is getting appropriate medical care. Because this entire process can be cumbersome and expensive, comparatively few surrogates are guardians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4019327651\"><span class=\"h3\">Default surrogates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While some surrogates are patient appointed and some are court appointed, most surrogates are designated by clinicians pursuant to statutory priority lists that typically proceed in this sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/23,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,27</a>] (though the precise order varies from state to state):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spouse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adult child</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adult sibling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nearest living relative</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close friend</p><p/><p>Many states impose limitations on these categories.

Consequently, some states have developed special mechanisms for authorizing treatment decisions on behalf of these &ldquo;unbefriended&rdquo; or &ldquo;unrepresented&rdquo; patients. But, such mechanisms are available in only a few states and often for only certain treatment decisions or certain patient populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1693949920\"><span class=\"h2\">Methods for making decisions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Capacitated patients have the right to refuse medical care and can use whatever criteria they deem acceptable; it is their values, whatever they are, that guide their choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Similarly, for mentally incapacitated patients who left advance directives that specify the interventions they want or do not want, their values determine their choices. Regarding mentally incapacitated patients who either appointed a proxy without specific indications of their wishes or who never completed an advance care directive, this question remains controversial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1535227473\"><span class=\"h3\">Substituted judgment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to court decisions, the substituted judgment criterion holds that the surrogate should try to imagine what the patient would do if the patient were competent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

The decision is subjective in the sense that the proxy tries to figure out what the incompetent person would want. However, in the absence of specific guidance from the patient when competent, substituted judgment becomes more of a guessing game, or as some courts have called it, a &ldquo;cruel charade&rdquo; or &ldquo;a legal fiction at best,&rdquo; than a way of fulfilling the patient&rsquo;s wishes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/12,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,32</a>].</p><p>It may be possible to imagine what the incompetent would want if he or she had left explicit instructions, such as a living will.

When there are no explicit instructions, the attempt to predict what the person would want is unrealistic. Unfortunately, most surrogates, even close family members, cannot accurately predict what the patient would have wanted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. Empirical studies suggest that the preferences of individuals regarding medical treatment may shift over time, meaning that, even if they were accurately informed at one point, surrogates could inaccurately represent a patient&rsquo;s wishes at the time of incapacitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3281972104\"><span class=\"h3\">Best interests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the surrogate cannot apply the substituted judgment standard, then the surrogate should employ the best interests standard.

Legally, this standard is considered &ldquo;objective&rdquo; because it does not rely on imagining what the patient would choose but rather on some externally defined standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The President&rsquo;s Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research endorsed this standard, as have several prominent courts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/11,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,39</a>].</p><p>For the best interests standard to work, there must be some &ldquo;objective, societally shared criteria&rdquo; about what constitutes benefits and burdens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, as many court cases in which there is conflict between family members or between family members and the medical team (eg, Schiavo case) make clear, there is no objective way of determining benefits and burdens and how they should be balanced. (See <a href=\"#H1895465206\" class=\"local\">'The Schiavo case'</a> above.)</p><p>One court suggested that burden should be determined solely by levels of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, for many people, being in a persistent vegetative state, even if they are not feeling pain, is a serious burden that they would want to avoid. As one dissenting judge put it: &ldquo;A decision to focus exclusively on pain as the single criterion ignores and devalues other important ideals regarding life and death&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Thus, deciding what constitutes a benefit or burden seems to depend on a patient&rsquo;s personal values. The notion of an objective best interests standard also seems illusory. On the other hand, many courts use balance sheets that specify the burdens and benefits of treatments in tables and rows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1692110159\"><span class=\"h3\">Ordinary versus extraordinary care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several other criteria have been proposed to help guide surrogate decision makers. Unfortunately, none is both practically feasible and ethically justified. For example, derived originally from Catholic teachings but used by secular scholars, some advocate a distinction between ordinary and extraordinary care, with ordinary care being mandatory, whereas extraordinary care may be withheld or withdrawn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>However, many ethicists and courts have concluded that the distinction between ordinary and extraordinary care is too vague and has &ldquo;too many conflicting meanings&rdquo; to be helpful in guiding surrogate decision makers and clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/11,12,30,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,30,41</a>]. As one lawyer noted, ordinary and extraordinary are &ldquo;extremely fact-sensitive, relative terms: what is ordinary for one patient under particular circumstances may be extraordinary for the same patient under different circumstances, or for a different patient under the same circumstances&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Importantly, however, the court did not delineate uniform national rules regarding who should decide for mentally incapacitated patients. Instead, the court permitted each state to make the rules it deemed best. The court also endorsed, as legally acceptable but not required, Missouri&rsquo;s contention that the &ldquo;evidence of the incompetent&rsquo;s wishes as to the withdrawal of treatment be provided by clear and convincing evidence.&rdquo;</p><p>Since then, several state supreme courts have limited the rights of families to decide for incompetent patients when there is no advance care directive or formal appointment of a proxy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. These courts have accepted that, when a patient who is mentally incapacitated is in a persistent vegetative state, comatose, or terminally ill, family members (even if not formally appointed as proxy decision makers) can withdraw life-sustaining treatments based on prior conversations with the patient or on their understanding of the patient&rsquo;s values. </p><p>However, these courts have refused to permit families not formally appointed as proxies to terminate life-sustaining treatments for mentally incapacitated but conscious patients, patients who can interact minimally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

A few months prior to his accident, he had explicitly stated that he would not want to live like his father-in-law, who was dying of gangrene and had his ventilator withdrawn at the family&rsquo;s request. Similarly, he explicitly stated to his brother just days before his accident that his brother should not let him be kept alive in a vegetative state. </p><p>But, the California Supreme Court ruled that, when the patient is conscious and not terminally ill, and there is no advance care directive, there must be &ldquo;clear and convincing&rdquo; evidence of the patient&rsquo;s view [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Families and patients were fighting for the right to stop life-sustaining treatment. But since the 1990s, the focus has been just the opposite. Patients and families are fighting for the right to continue life-sustaining treatment. Increasingly, families want clinicians to maintain life-sustaining treatments for patients who are comatose, in a persistent vegetative state, anencephalic, or otherwise catastrophically critically ill. But, the treating clinicians object to providing such treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. </p><p>In difficult cases, clinicians, nurses, and other care providers should come to an agreement on how they think it is best to care for the patient and whether withdrawal of medical interventions is appropriate. This will typically use the best interest standard informed by whatever knowledge the team has of the patient&rsquo;s previous wishes. This shared understanding among the caregiving team is critical; any dissent makes it harder to approach the family and will frequently become a focus of discussion with the family. Once an agreed upon approach is developed, there should be a discussion with the family to present the reasons why the recommended approach is considered best.

Some hospitals have enacted &ldquo;unilateral DNR&rdquo; policies to allow clinicians to provide a do-not-resuscitate order in cases where consensus cannot be reached with families and there is medical opinion that resuscitation would be futile if attempted. Indeed, some states have enacted so-called medical futility laws to protect clinicians from liability if they terminate life-sustaining treatments against family wishes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

As of 2007, according to data from Baylor University Medical Center on 16 Texas hospitals, there had been 974 ethics committee consultations on medical futility cases, 65 in which committees ruled against families and gave notice that treatment would be terminated.
