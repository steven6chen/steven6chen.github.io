NAFLD may progress to cirrhosis and is likely an important cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the natural history and treatment of NAFLD. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of NAFLD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H244507317\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53583253\"><span class=\"h2\">NAFL versus NASH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is subdivided into nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In NAFL, hepatic steatosis is present without evidence of inflammation, whereas in NASH, hepatic steatosis is associated with hepatic inflammation that histologically is indistinguishable from alcoholic steatohepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Other terms that have been used to describe NASH include pseudoalcoholic hepatitis, alcohol-like hepatitis, fatty liver hepatitis, steatonecrosis, and diabetic hepatitis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53583246\"><span class=\"h2\">NAFLD activity score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The NAFLD activity score (NAS) is a validated score that is used to grade disease activity in patients with NAFLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The NAS is the sum of the biopsy's individual scores for steatosis (0 to 3), lobular inflammation (0 to 3), and hepatocellular ballooning (0 to 2). Fibrosis is not included in the NAS. In the study that derived the NAS, scores of 0 to 2 occurred in cases largely considered not diagnostic of NASH; scores of 3 to 4 were evenly divided among those considered not diagnostic, borderline, or positive for NASH; and scores of 5 to 8 occurred in cases that were largely considered diagnostic of NASH (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histologic-scoring-systems-for-chronic-liver-disease#H2349826112\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Histologic scoring systems for chronic liver disease&quot;, section on 'Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may eventually develop cirrhosis. Cirrhosis develops when simple steatosis progresses to steatohepatitis and then fibrosis. Among patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, up to 70 percent have risk factors for NAFLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. While the risk of disease progression among patients with NAFLD has been evaluated in multiple studies, the results have been variable, and the risk of developing advanced fibrosis among patients with NAFLD is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/3,4,8-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,8-19</a>]. A meta-analysis that included 11 studies looked at fibrosis progression in 366 patients with NAFLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Overall, fibrosis progressed in 132 (36 percent), remained stable in 158 (46 percent), and improved in 76 (21 percent). It appears that patients with simple steatosis on biopsy are at low risk for developing significant fibrosis, whereas those with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis are at higher risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, some patients with fibrosis show regression of their disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H243002537\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors for progression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of risk factors for liver disease progression have been identified in patients with NAFLD. One of the most important risk factors is histologic evidence of hepatic inflammation. </p><p>This was examined in a meta-analysis that included six studies that looked at 133 patients with NAFL who had paired biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Fibrosis progressed in 52 (39 percent), remained stable in 70 (53 percent), and improved in 11 (8 percent). Overall, the average annual fibrosis progression rate (number of stages of fibrosis progression over a year) was 0.07 stages, and at the end of the study 12 patients (9 percent) had stage 3 fibrosis and two patients (1.5 percent) had stage 4 fibrosis. The meta-analysis also included seven studies that looked at 116 patients with NASH. Progressive fibrosis was seen in 40 (35 percent), stable fibrosis in 45 (39 percent), and improvement in fibrosis in 31 (27 percent). The annual fibrosis progression rate among patients with NASH was 0.14 stages, and at the end of the study 13 patients (11 percent) had stage 3 fibrosis and 16 patients (14 percent) had stage 4 fibrosis. In a systematic review that included 187 patients with paired biopsies, the median time to develop advanced fibrosis among those with inflammation on the initial biopsy was 4.2 years, compared with 13.4 years for those without inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. After adjusting for potential confounders, the presence of any inflammation on the initial biopsy increased the chance of progressing to advanced fibrosis 2.5-fold compared with patients who did not have inflammation.</p><p>In a retrospective study with 619 patients with NAFLD, biopsy features associated with liver transplantation or death included fibrosis stage (hazard ratio [HR] 1.8 to 6.4, with a dose-response relationship), diabetes (HR 1.6), smoking (HR 2.6), and statin use, which was protective (HR 0.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

As an example, in a study of 71 patients with NAFLD followed for a mean of 14 years, 17 patients (24 percent) had fibrosis progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Heavy (more than 60 g of alcohol on one occasion for men or 48 g for women) episodic drinking was more common in those with fibrosis progression than in those without progression (47 versus 11 percent). </p><p>Some studies suggest that the consumption of as little as two drinks per day in those who are overweight (and one drink per day in those who are obese) is associated in hepatic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, other data suggest that light or moderate alcohol consumption may have beneficial effects on the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].

Modest drinkers had lower odds for fibrosis (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.41-0.77) and ballooning hepatocellular injury (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.48-0.92).

In a systematic review of 61 studies and case series of patients with NAFLD or NASH, the risk of HCC among those with cirrhosis ranged from 2.4 percent over seven years to 12.8 percent over three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

In a series of 622 liver transplants, eight patients, all female, had features consistent with NASH pre-transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 1999 to 2012 included 6000 adults in whom rates of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis, as determined by the NAFLD activity score, were 30 and 10.3 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Overall mortality was lower in NAFLD participants without fibrosis (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.22-0.76), and mortality was higher in NAFLD participants with advanced fibrosis (HR 3.13, 95% CI 1.93-5.08). </p><p>Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death among patients with NAFLD. A previous study (NHANES III), which showed similar trends in mortality, found that the increase in mortality in NAFLD patients with fibrosis (as measured by the NAFLD fibrosis score) was due almost exclusively to cardiovascular causes (HR 3.46, 95% CI 1.91-6.25) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The association with cardiovascular disease suggests that there should be a reduced threshold for surveillance for cardiovascular disease in patients with NAFLD or NASH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-management-of-nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

A general approach to the management of patients with cirrhosis is presented elsewhere.

In patients who have never had a liver biopsy, or who had a liver biopsy that showed steatosis but not steatohepatitis, we obtain a liver biopsy if the physical examination or laboratory findings suggest progressive liver disease.

In a prospective study of 120 patients with biopsy proven NAFLD, VCTE correctly identified 74 patients (45 percent) as having low risk for advanced fibrosis. This approach would avoid the need for liver biopsy in these low-risk patients while those at high risk for fibrosis generally require confirmatory biopsy or further imaging. VCTE is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-assessment-of-hepatic-fibrosis-ultrasound-based-elastography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis: Ultrasound-based elastography&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In patients who had a baseline liver biopsy that showed NASH and who have stable or improved clinical findings, we obtain liver biopsy or VCTE in five to seven years to monitor for disease progression.

In addition to its other health benefits, weight loss, either through lifestyle modifications or bariatric surgery, has been associated with histologic improvement in patients with NAFLD. A reasonable goal for many patients is to lose 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/week</span> (1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">lb/week)</span>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orlistat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Orlistat</a> can be used to aid with weight loss in patients who fail to achieve weight loss goals through diet and exercise alone.

Heavy alcohol use is associated with alcoholic liver disease and numerous other adverse consequences, including cancers of the mouth and esophagus and injuries due to accidents. In patients with or at risk for NAFLD, heavy alcohol use is associated with hepatic steatosis, hepatic injury, and fibrosis progression.

Management of patients with NAFLD includes optimization of blood glucose control in patients with diabetes and treatment of hyperlipidemia.
