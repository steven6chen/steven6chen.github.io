In our practice, active management consists of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> administration, delayed cord clamping (if medically appropriate for mother and infant, otherwise immediate cord clamping), and controlled cord traction.</p><p>In the past, active management has generally consisted of prophylactic administration of an uterotonic agent prior to placental separation, early cord clamping, and controlled cord traction; uterine massage also may have been performed. The uterotonic agent is the most important component of this combination of interventions and cord traction has been associated with some benefits. Uterine massage has been insufficiently studied, but evidence so far does not show benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-third-stage-of-labor-drug-therapy-to-minimize-hemorrhage/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Early cord clamping in vigorous infants is generally avoided in contemporary obstetrics because of potential neonatal benefits from prolonging the duration of placental transfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of normal labor and delivery&quot;, section on 'Cord clamping'</a>.)</p><p>In cases when uterotonic agents are not available or are declined by the patient, breast feeding might reduce the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-third-stage-of-labor-drug-therapy-to-minimize-hemorrhage/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The benefits and risks of active management were illustrated in a 2015 systematic review of randomized trials comparing active versus expectant management or a mixture of managements of the third stage of labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-third-stage-of-labor-drug-therapy-to-minimize-hemorrhage/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Active management was defined as administration of a prophylactic uterotonic agent before delivery of the placenta; typically with early cord <span class=\"nowrap\">clamping/cutting</span> and controlled traction of the umbilical cord. Expectant or physiologic management was spontaneous delivery of the placenta without the use of uterotonic agents or cord traction. Major findings were:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In general obstetrical populations, active management reduced the risk of maternal hemorrhage &gt;1000 mL (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14-0.87; <span class=\"nowrap\">8/1000</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">24/1000;</span> three trials, 4636 women) and postpartum maternal hemoglobin &lt;9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30-0.83; <span class=\"nowrap\">36/1000</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">71/1000;</span> two trials, 1572 women) compared with expectant management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Active management also reduced the risk of primary blood loss &gt;500 mL (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.27-0.44), maternal blood transfusion (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.22-0.55), and use of therapeutic uterotonics during the third stage or within the first 24 hours, or both (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.15-0.23) compared with expectant management. Mean maternal blood loss at birth was also reduced (-79 mL, 95% CI -96 to -62 mL).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>However, there were also statistical increases in maternal diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg (RR 4.10), after-pains and use of analgesia (RR 2.53), and number of women returning to the hospital because of bleeding (RR 2.21) compared with expectant management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The length of the third stage was similar for both active and expectant management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In women at low risk of postpartum bleeding, the benefits of active management were less robust. Rates of hemorrhage &gt;500 mLs, blood transfusion, and use of therapeutic uterotonics were reduced with active management, but reductions in hemorrhage &gt;1000 mLs and maternal hemoglobin &lt;9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> at 24 to 72 hours were no longer statistically significant.</p><p/><p>Despite this and other evidence supporting active management of the third stage, this approach has been underutilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-third-stage-of-labor-drug-therapy-to-minimize-hemorrhage/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

The value of oxytocin was shown in a 2013 systematic review that compared prophylactic administration of oxytocin to no uterotonic agents in the third stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-third-stage-of-labor-drug-therapy-to-minimize-hemorrhage/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients treated with oxytocin demonstrated a significant reduction in postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) (blood loss &gt;500 mL: relative risk [RR] 0.53, 95% CI 0.38-0.74; six trials, n = 4203 women) and need for therapeutic uterotonic drugs (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.36-0.87; 4 trials, n = 3174 women).</p><p>The benefits of prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> need to be balanced against the adverse effects, which are dose related and include hypotension, tachycardia, increased cardiac output, myocardial ischemia, flushing, nausea, vomiting, and mild antidiuresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-third-stage-of-labor-drug-therapy-to-minimize-hemorrhage/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Rarely, large doses of oxytocin given for a prolonged period of time have caused water retention, leading to hyponatremia and its sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-third-stage-of-labor-drug-therapy-to-minimize-hemorrhage/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

It should not be given before delivery of the anterior fetal shoulder to ensure that shoulder dystocia, if present, is not exacerbated. We give oxytocin before placental separation to expedite the process and continue it after placental expulsion to enhance contraction of the uterus and reduce the volume of blood loss. In a systematic review, administration of oxytocin before versus after the expulsion of placenta did not significantly impact important clinical outcomes, such as the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.62-1.04), rate of placental retention (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.76-3.11), length of the third stage of labor (mean difference -0.30 minutes, 95% CI -0.95 to 0.36), postpartum blood loss (mean difference 22.32 mLs, 95% CI -58.21 to 102.86) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-third-stage-of-labor-drug-therapy-to-minimize-hemorrhage/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, a modest benefit in reduction of postpartum hemorrhage cannot be excluded.</p><p>A survey of Canadian obstetricians reported 52 percent of respondents administered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> prior to delivery of the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-third-stage-of-labor-drug-therapy-to-minimize-hemorrhage/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A similar questionnaire given to 1500 obstetricians in Texas found that only 15 percent administered oxytocics prior to delivery of the placenta, whereas 92 percent did so after placental expulsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-third-stage-of-labor-drug-therapy-to-minimize-hemorrhage/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

The dose and duration of intravenous oxytocin infusion as a prophylactic agent vary widely among institutions. A commonly used dose is 10 to 40 units of oxytocin per 500 mL 0.9 percent saline, with the rate of infusion adjusted, as needed, to prevent uterine atony. Higher doses have been studied, but did not demonstrate a clear benefit. In a randomized trial comparing two oxytocin doses (80 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/500</span> mL versus 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/500</span> mL infused over one hour), there was no significant difference between the doses in the composite outcome of atony or hemorrhage requiring treatment (uterotonic drugs, transfusion, tamponade, embolization, surgery) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-third-stage-of-labor-drug-therapy-to-minimize-hemorrhage/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>In the absence of strong evidence favoring one dose over another, it is the authors&rsquo; practice to infuse 20 units of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> in 500 mL 0.9 percent saline over the first hour following delivery of the placenta. We subsequently infuse an additional 20 units of oxytocin in 1 L of fluid at a rate of 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>. This is generally continued for eight hours to complete the 1 L infusion.

In our practice, active management consists of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> administration, delayed cord clamping (if medically appropriate for mother and infant, otherwise immediate cord clamping), and controlled cord traction. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Active management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oxytocin</a> or the combined ergometrine-oxytocin preparation (ie, Syntometrine, not available in the United States) are the uterotonic drugs most commonly used for management of the third stage &#160; We suggest oxytocin rather than ergometrine-oxytocin (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). When compared with oxytocin alone, ergometrine-oxytocin appears to be associated with a small reduction in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage &ge;500 to 1000 mL, but an increase in side effects (vomiting, hypertension). Prophylactic oxytocin administration in the third stage reduces the risk of postpartum hemorrhage by 50 percent. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Oxytocin'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Ergometrine-oxytocin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> infusion rather than bolus intravenous injection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), as the latter can cause ischemic electrocardiogram changes, cardiovascular collapse, and cardiac arrest. In the absence of intravenous access, intramuscular injection (up to 10 units) is reasonable. Intraumbilical vein injection is not effective.

This is generally continued for eight hours to complete the 1 L infusion. Oxytocin doses of 10 to 40 units are commonly used.

There are insufficient data to determine whether administration of the uterotonic agent is more effective if given before separation of the placenta or immediately upon expulsion of the placenta.

These drugs are contraindicated in women with hypertension, history of migraine, or Raynaud phenomenon.
