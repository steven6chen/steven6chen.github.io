These proteins build up in different organs, which can lead to problems.</p><p>There are different types of amyloidosis depending on which protein is abnormal. This type involves a type of protein called &quot;light chains.&quot; In AL amyloidosis, the &quot;A&quot; is for amyloidosis and the &quot;L&quot; is for light chains. Doctors also call it &quot;immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis.&quot; Normal light chains are used to make antibodies, which help the body fight infections. In AL amyloidosis, cells in the bone marrow (the tissue inside your bones that makes blood cells) make abnormal light chains. These abnormal light chains can build up in the kidneys, heart, liver, and other organs.</p><p>AL amyloidosis mostly affects older adults, and is more common in men than in women.</p><p>Sometimes, AL amyloidosis is related to another problem, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple myeloma, which is a cancer of a type of white blood cell called &quot;plasma cells&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia, which is a problem with another type of cell made in the bone marrow</p><p/><p>Not everyone with AL amyloidosis has one of these other problems. Your doctor will do tests to check for them.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H852695225\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of AL amyloidosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different people get different symptoms. They might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling very tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight without trying</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling in the feet, ankles, legs, or belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large tongue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin that bruises easily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Purple or bruised-looking skin around the eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding more than usual, for example, after an injury</p><p/><p>AL amyloidosis can affect multiple organs. But in some people, it only affects 1 organ. Commonly affected organs include the:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidneys &ndash; Problems with the kidneys can lead to too much protein in the urine. Kidney problems can also cause fluid to build up in your body, which leads to swelling. Your kidneys might not work as well as they should, which can lead to kidney failure (when they stop working completely).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart &ndash; Your heart might have trouble pumping blood normally. This can lead to symptoms of heart failure, such as swelling or trouble breathing. Some people also have an abnormal heartbeat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver &ndash; Your liver might be larger than normal.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1745528122\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for AL amyloidosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have symptoms of AL amyloidosis, your doctor or nurse will do an exam and tests. Some tests look for the abnormal protein people with AL amyloidosis have. Other tests check for problems with your organs.</p><p>Tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy &ndash; For this test, a doctor takes a small sample of tissue and then looks at it with a microscope. Your doctor might do a biopsy of your bone marrow plus a biopsy from your belly area. In some cases, he or she will do a biopsy from a different organ.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body. Your doctor might suggest imaging tests to look at your internal organs. For example, you might get an echocardiogram (also called an &quot;echo&quot;) to check your heart or an ultrasound to check your liver.</p><p/><p>Your doctor might suggest other tests, too, depending on your symptoms. This might seem like a lot of tests. But it's important for your doctor to know for sure if you have amyloidosis, and which type you have. That's because AL amyloidosis is treated differently from other types.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3762630211\"><span class=\"h1\">How is AL amyloidosis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for AL amyloidosis includes chemotherapy, bone marrow transplant, or both. There is no cure for AL amyloidosis. But treatment can help reduce symptoms, and help you to live longer.</p><p>Before starting treatment, you will need tests. In addition to the tests above, which can tell your doctor that you have AL amyloidosis, you will get other tests. These are so your doctor can see which of your organs are affected, and how much damage there is. They can also check for other problems that might need treatment.</p><p>Your treatment might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; This is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. These medicines can also stop growth of the cells that make the abnormal protein in AL amyloidosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow transplant &ndash; This procedure replaces the abnormal cells in your bone marrow with healthy cells. It is also called a &quot;stem cell transplant.&quot; When this is done to treat AL amyloidosis, the &quot;donor cells&quot; come from your own body. Stem cells are removed from your blood, then you get chemotherapy to kill the abnormal cells in your bone marrow. After that, your stem cells are returned to your body through a vein. The new stem cells help replace the cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy and grow into healthy bone marrow.</p><p/><p>Your doctor or nurse might also talk with you about being in a clinical trial. A clinical trial is a research study that uses volunteers to test new treatments.</p><p>After treatment, your doctor will do regular tests to see if the amount of abnormal protein in your body has gone down. He or she will also do tests to check if the problems with your organs have gotten better. If not, your doctor might suggest trying a different medicine or combination of medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3014560104\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=monoclonal-gammopathy-of-undetermined-significance-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-myeloma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Multiple myeloma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
