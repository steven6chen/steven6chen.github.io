Although some patients present with relatively mild renal insufficiency, this disorder is typically associated with severe renal injury that, if untreated, progresses quickly to end-stage renal failure.</p><p>An important determinant of the response to therapy and long-term prognosis is <strong>early diagnosis</strong> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. There is a direct correlation between the initial plasma creatinine concentration and the percent of glomeruli with crescents; in particular, crescents are present in more than 75 percent of glomeruli when the plasma creatinine concentration is above 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (442 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span>. Avoidance of maintenance dialysis is rare in patients who require dialysis within 72 hours of presentation, particularly in those who have crescents involving all glomeruli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. By comparison, prevention of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) can usually be achieved in less severe cases, although some do progress. The proportion of preserved glomeruli and the presence of oligoanuria may be the best determinants of prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Selection of patients to be treated'</a> below.)</p><p>The treatment of anti-GBM antibody disease is discussed in this review. The pathogenesis, prognosis and clinical manifestations of this disorder are discussed elsewhere.

Reviews of available reports suggest that approximately 40 to 45 percent of patients will benefit by not progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or death, when treated with plasmapheresis in combination with immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/4,5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,8</a>]. However, recovery is much more likely in patients who begin treatment before oligoanuria ensues, and is rare in patients who require dialysis or who have 100 percent crescents on biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Plasmapheresis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only available randomized trial evaluated outcomes among 17 patients who were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> alone, or with plasmapheresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. After the end of treatment, two of eight patients who received plasmapheresis, compared with six of nine in the immunosuppression alone group, became dialysis dependent. The authors concluded that, although there may have been some benefit from plasmapheresis, the percent of crescents on initial renal biopsy and entry plasma creatinine correlated better with outcome.</p><p>Regardless of therapy, patients with less than 30 percent crescents and a plasma creatinine below 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (265 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> did well, while those with severe crescentic involvement and a plasma creatinine above 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (354 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> did poorly.</p><p>The trial results are consistent with a large retrospective study of 221 patients from China that reported better patient and renal survival among those treated with plasmapheresis, glucocorticoids, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> compared with those who received glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Despite the absence of definitive evidence of benefit, plasmapheresis is generally recommended for the treatment of patients with anti-GBM disease. Two factors are considered by many experts to justify this recommendation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improved morbidity and mortality in the era of plasmapheresis compared to historic rates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-diagnosis-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and diagnosis of anti-GBM antibody (Goodpasture's) disease&quot;, section on 'Prognosis of untreated patients'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biological plausibility of greater amelioration of the consequences of disease with rapid removal of anti-GBM antibody, compared with a slower reduction in levels seen with immunosuppressive agents alone.</p><p/><p>The recommended initial plasmapheresis prescription is either daily or alternate-day 4 liter exchanges for two to three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/1,3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,6</a>]. In general, albumin is given as the replacement fluid. If, however, the patient has had a recent renal biopsy or has pulmonary hemorrhage, then one to two liters of fresh frozen plasma should be substituted for albumin at the end of the procedure to reverse plasmapheresis-induced depletion of coagulation factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>A potential complication with fresh frozen plasma (14 percent citrate by volume) is the development of metabolic alkalosis. Metabolism of the administered citrate generates bicarbonate, the excretion of which may be limited by concurrent renal failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic apheresis (plasma exchange or cytapheresis): Complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The patient should be reassessed at the end of this two- to three-week regimen. Further plasmapheresis may be unnecessary if the patient has improved and there is a marked decline in serum anti-GBM antibody titers. By comparison, continued plasmapheresis may be required if the patient still has active pulmonary disease (eg, hemoptysis) or if antibody titers are not declining substantially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunosuppressive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasmapheresis must be accompanied by glucocorticoids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Most patients are given pulse <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> (15 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> to a maximum of dose of 1000 mg intravenously over 20 minutes) daily for three doses followed by daily oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day to a maximum of 60 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> which can be tapered once remission is induced. However, some patients have been treated with oral glucocorticoids without an intravenous pulse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The initial cyclophosphamide dose is 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day orally. It has been suggested that the dose should not exceed 100 mg per day in patients over the age of 60 years to limit toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Although we recommend oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, the relative efficacy of oral and intravenous cyclophosphamide in anti-GBM disease is not known. Intravenous therapy may be used in patients who cannot take oral medications, who are unreliable, or who have severe renal failure and oliguria, a setting in which the bladder toxicity of oral cyclophosphamide may be increased. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-the-use-of-cyclophosphamide-in-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of the use of cyclophosphamide in rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This aggressive regimen is warranted because anti-GBM antibody disease may be fatal and has a high risk of permanent renal failure.</p><p>Patients who either refuse or, because of severe side effects, need to discontinue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> may receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> therapy or, alternatively, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil. Several reported cases have documented successful treatment of anti-GBM antibody disease with these agents; however, evidence in the form of controlled trials is lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. If the patient is receiving daily plasma exchange, the first of the two rituximab doses can be given after the initial seven consecutive days of plasma exchange and glucocorticoids (because concurrent rituximab and plasma exchange will result in removal of rituximab from the circulation). After a 48-hour period has elapsed, another seven days of plasma exchange can be performed, after which the second of the two doses of rituximab is given. If the patient is receiving alternate-day plasma exchange, rituximab should be given immediately after the exchange, which will permit time for binding of rituximab to B cells prior to the next plasma exchange treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal duration of therapy is unknown.

This observation led to the suggestion that, after remission is induced, maintenance therapy with less toxic drugs, such as low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> should be given for six to nine months.</p><p>However, most patients in a large series were treated successfully with two to three weeks of plasmapheresis (daily when possible), approximately three months of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, and prednisone alone for the subsequent six to nine months (which was slowly tapered) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. These results and the low risk of recurrent disease, led some experts to suggest that the duration of therapy may be as short as two to three months, if anti-GBM antibody titers (which should be monitored regularly) are persistently negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p>Anti-GBM antibody levels should be monitored every one to two weeks until they are negative on two occasions. We periodically monitor anti-GBM levels for up to six months to confirm that remission is maintained or at any time if there are clinical signs suggestive of recurrence. Recurrent clinical signs, in the presence of positive anti-GBM antibody, should prompt a further course of plasmapheresis.</p><p>If antibody levels remain elevated, the immunosuppressive regimen above should be continued.

Smoking is the most common cause of underlying pulmonary disease, although pneumonia and smoke or hydrocarbon inhalation have also been implicated in selected cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with renal involvement (including those with plasma creatinine concentrations above 5 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [442 to 616 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> who do not require immediate renal replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal therapy in patients who present with less severe disease (variably described as less than 30 to 50 percent crescents on renal biopsy) is uncertain.

In this retrospective study of 27 double-positive patients with both anti-GBM antibody and ANCA, renal biopsy showed extensive glomerular cellular crescents in most patients; among the 17 who were dialysis dependent at presentation, none recovered renal function despite immunosuppression.

In one such individual, for example, the combined use of immunosuppression and immunoadsorption using a sepharose-coupled sheep-antihuman IgG column for 25 cycles resulted in the recovery of renal function, with a stable creatinine concentration of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

This observation provides the rationale for attempting to suppress T cell involvement. The effect of blockade of CD28-B7, a costimulatory pathway for T cell activation, by the fusion protein CTLA4Ig was evaluated in a rat model of anti-GBM antibody disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The development of crescentic glomerulonephritis was completely prevented.

As previously delineated, renal and patient survival correlates closely with the degree of renal impairment at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/3,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,37</a>]. Patients with moderate to severe disease who do not require dialysis upon presentation generally respond to therapy, with recovery being maintained during long-term follow-up. By comparison, few who require immediate dialysis escape the need for maintenance dialysis. A report of a large series of Asian patients from China confirms the earlier findings seen in Caucasian patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Other clinical and pathologic features have also been shown to predict renal outcomes among patients with anti-GBM antibody disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large, multicenter series of 123 patients diagnosed with anti-GBM antibody disease between 1986 and 2015, five-year renal and patient survival rates were 34 and 83 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Patients who were diagnosed after 2007 had twice the renal survival rate (50 percent) compared with those who were diagnosed before 2007. This improved outcome may have been due, at least in part, to milder disease and more intensive treatment among the patients diagnosed more recently. In a multivariable analysis, dialysis dependency at presentation (hazard ratio [HR] 3.17, 95% CI 1.59-6.32) was the strongest predictor of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) during follow-up. In addition, certain histopathologic features, such as the percentage of normal glomeruli (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95-0.99) and the extent of interstitial infiltrate on kidney biopsy (HR 2.02, 95% CI 1.17-3.50), were also identified as independent predictors of ESRD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study of 43 patients with anti-GBM antibody disease, oligoanuria at diagnosis was the strongest predictor of patient mortality, and both oligoanuria and the percentage of glomerular crescents seen on biopsy were the best predictors of a poor renal outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p>Relapses are uncommon (around two percent in one center's experience), but data are not sufficient to determine reliably how often this occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/3,39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,39-42</a>]. Clinical relapses are more common in patients who are also ANCA-positive, in whom it is the vasculitis and not the anti-GBM antibody disease that is reactivated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>There may be a higher rate of recurrence in the patient who is a smoker or has exposure to hydrocarbon in his occupation.

Early diagnosis is critical for achieving the best response to therapy since the percent of crescents on initial kidney biopsy and the pretherapy plasma creatinine concentration correlate best with outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Recovery of kidney function is rare if dialysis is required at initiation of treatment.</p><p>The treatment of choice is plasmapheresis in conjunction with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>. Plasmapheresis removes circulating anti-GBM antibodies and other mediators of inflammation, and the immunosuppressive agents minimize new antibody formation.

However, given the inability to consistently and accurately identify patients who may recover renal function, a short trial of therapy (two to three weeks) should be considered. The patient should be informed that the likelihood of regaining significant kidney function in this setting is small (8 percent at one year in the study cited above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-anti-gbm-antibody-goodpastures-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend concurrent treatment with plasmapheresis and immunosuppression (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).</p><p>Duration of therapy is largely determined by attainment of clinical remission and disappearance of anti-GBM antibody, which occurs in two to three weeks in most patients (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Plasmapheresis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest daily (if possible) or alternate-day 4 liter exchanges with albumin given as the replacement fluid.
