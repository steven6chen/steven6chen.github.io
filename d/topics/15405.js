Examples of positive symptoms include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hallucinations &ndash; Hallucinations are when you hear, see, feel, smell, or taste things that aren't there. For example, people with schizophrenia often hear voices in their head telling them to do things when there isn't really anyone talking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Delusions &ndash; Delusions are when you believe things that are not true. For example, people with schizophrenia sometimes believe they are a famous person who is dead.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Disorganized thinking or speech &ndash; People with schizophrenia have trouble thinking in an organized way. They can talk and talk about a lot of things before getting to the point. Sometimes they make up words or say things that do not make any sense.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Negative symptoms</strong> &ndash; In this case, &quot;negative&quot; does not mean &quot;bad.&quot; Negative symptoms are <strong>normal behaviors that stop</strong> because of schizophrenia. Examples of negative symptoms include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Not showing much emotion and not changing your facial expression </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Not moving or talking much</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Not taking showers or keeping clean</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Not having much interest in spending time with people or having fun</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cognitive symptoms</strong> &ndash; Cognitive symptoms are symptoms that affect your ability to think clearly. People with schizophrenia have trouble:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Learning and remembering</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Understanding speech or other forms of communication</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Making sense of new information</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Solving problems</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Emotional symptoms</strong> &ndash; People with schizophrenia often also have symptoms of anxiety or depression.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5394133\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for schizophrenia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is no test. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam. Your doctor might need to do tests to make sure your symptoms are not caused by a different medical problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5394140\"><span class=\"h1\">How is schizophrenia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Schizophrenia is treated with medicines that help control symptoms and with different types of counseling and support.</p><p>The medicines for schizophrenia often reduce symptoms, but they take some getting used to. Sometimes people need to try a few different medicines before finding the ones that work best and cause the fewest problems.</p><p>The medicines used to treat schizophrenia can cause uncomfortable side effects. If your medicines cause side effects, talk to your doctor about them. He or she might be able to lower your dose, switch you to a different medicine, or help manage the side effects in other ways.</p><p>To keep schizophrenia under control, you usually must take medicines for the rest of your life. It's important to take them exactly as directed. Otherwise, your symptoms could get worse.</p><p>It can also be useful for you and your family to take part in a type of therapy called &quot;family psychoeducation.&quot; This program can teach you and your loved ones some important concepts and skills, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>That schizophrenia is a biological illness and not anyone's fault</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ways to keep your condition from getting worse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ways to deal with your symptoms so that they are less stressful</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5394147\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, talk to your doctor before you start trying to get pregnant. Most women with schizophrenia need to keep taking medicines before and during pregnancy. But some women need to switch to medicines that are less likely to cause problems for the baby.</p><p>You might be tempted to go off medicines to protect your baby. But be aware that doing that could actually do more harm than good. Women who stop their medicines before or during pregnancy often get severe schizophrenia symptoms and end up needing more medicines than they would have if they had stayed on medicines in the first place.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5394228\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tardive-dyskinesia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tardive dyskinesia (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
