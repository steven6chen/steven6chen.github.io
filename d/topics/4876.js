Even when optimal treatment is provided, however, approximately 10 percent of patients remain severely affected with treatment-refractory OCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-brain-stimulation-for-treatment-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Deep brain stimulation (DBS), a treatment in which implanted electrodes send electrical pulses to specific locations in the brain, may be useful for a small proportion of patients with severe, incapacitating OCD that is refractory to other treatments.</p><p>Deep brain stimulation for OCD is discussed here.

A widely accepted hypothesis is that OCD is associated with hyperactivity of the cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic-cortical (CSTC) network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-brain-stimulation-for-treatment-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It is plausible that DBS inhibits or functionally overrides this pathological network hyperactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-brain-stimulation-for-treatment-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It is most likely that the therapeutic effects of DBS are caused by a combination of direct and indirect effects dependent on the specific cytoarchitecture of the stimulated brain area. Because the field intensity of the electrode decreases exponentially with distance, neurons are influenced in various ways. Although studies demonstrating the inhibitory characteristics of DBS are sparse, research combining imaging and DBS suggests that hyperactivity in the OFC correlates with the severity of OCD, and that OFC activity normalizes following DBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-brain-stimulation-for-treatment-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

The electrical impulses are generated by the IPG, which includes a battery, and is surgically implanted in the chest. An extension cable runs from the IPG, under the skin of the neck and scalp, through a burr hole in the skull, and connects to an electrode surgically implanted in the brain. The precise anatomic position of implantation is calculated beforehand on the basis of magnetic resonance and computer tomography scans. The lead is placed in the brain using a stereotactic head frame attached to the patient's skull under local anesthetic. </p><p>In bilateral DBS (most widely <span class=\"nowrap\">performed/studied</span> in OCD), a single pulse generator is placed in the chest with two extension cable outputs. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2440185\"><span class=\"h1\">ADMINISTRATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The implanted pulse generator used for DBS contains a microchip, allowing the neurostimulation to be modified. The activity of the electrode can be programmed externally with a portable appliance communicating with the pulse generator through telemetry. These adjustments are usually made by a senior psychiatrist with expertise of the phenomenology of OCD.</p><p>Adjustments can be made to the frequency, intensity, pulse width, and location of neurostimulation. Location is adjusted by activating different electrodes on the lead. Each electrode (usually four) can be stimulated separately. Research suggests that modification of these factors can lead to greater efficacy and fewer side effects in some cases, compared to the results obtained initially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-brain-stimulation-for-treatment-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>This adjustment phase takes on average three to six months, but may last up to 12 months. When adjustment appears to result in a clinical relevant response, the stimulation is maintained continuously. Parameters are typically adjusted on the basis of an individual patient&rsquo;s response and reported side effects such as impulsivity, sleeping problems, or tension. Twelve adjustments are needed, on average, with a two week interval between them before stable settings are arrived at. Among patients who do not appear to respond after adequate adjustment, modification continues until the best outcome is achieved. In very rare cases, in the event of absolute non-response and occurrence of side effects, the device is switched off and may eventually be removed.</p><p>Typical stimulation parameters for DBS in OCD can vary within the following ranges:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequency between 2 and 185 Hertz </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current power between 0 and 10 Volts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulse widths between 60 and 150 milliseconds</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18783071\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meta-analysis of small randomized trials suggest that deep brain stimulation (DBS) may reduce symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but larger trials will be needed to confirm these preliminary findings.</p><p>A 2015 meta-analysis identified 31 studies involving 116 subjects with OCD who received DBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-brain-stimulation-for-treatment-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Eighty-three subjects were implanted in striatal areas &ndash; anterior limb of the internal capsule, ventral <span class=\"nowrap\">striatum/ventral</span> capsule, nucleus accumbens &ndash; 27 in the subthalamic nucleus and six in the inferior thalamic peduncle. Patients experienced an average, estimated symptom reduction on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) of 45.1 percent and a response (&gt;35 percent Y-BOCS reduction) rate of 60 percent. No significant differences were detected in efficacy by target location. Adverse events were generally reported as mild, transient, and reversible. Better response was associated with older age at OCD onset and presence of <span class=\"nowrap\">religious/sexual</span> obsessions and compulsions. (See <a href=\"#H18783078\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> below.) </p><p>A 2011 review, which included case reports as well as clinical trials, found that 34 of 63 patients with OCD showed an improvement of 35 percent or more on the Y-BOCS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/deep-brain-stimulation-for-treatment-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The mean decrease in Y-BOCS score ranged from 7 to 31 points over a treatment period of 3 to 36 months.

After eight months of active stimulation, reduced performances persisted, except for a significant improvement in verbal fluency.

An effective treatment for selected patients with advanced Parkinson disease, DBS is an investigational treatment for incapacitating, treatment-refractory OCD. (See <a href=\"#H1406544\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Device-assisted and surgical treatments for Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the mechanism of deep brain stimulation (DBS) is unknown, a widely accepted hypothesis is that OCD is associated with hyperactivity of the cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic-cortical (CSTC) network. It is plausible that DBS inhibits or functionally overrides this pathological network hyperactivity. (See <a href=\"#H18783050\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency, intensity, pulse width and location of the neurostimulation can be adjusted over the course of treatment; this may increase effectiveness and reduce side effects of DBS treatment. (See <a href=\"#H2440185\" class=\"local\">'Administration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The efficacy of DBS for OCD has not been established, but preliminary trials, either uncontrolled or inadequately controlled, have shown promising results. Of 63 patients with treatment refractory OCD who have received DBS, 34 experienced a reduction of symptoms of 35 percent or more. (See <a href=\"#H18783071\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DBS implantation is an invasive procedure that can cause infection, hemorrhage, confusion, or seizures. Severe adverse effects are uncommon; the mortality rate has been estimated at 0.6 percent. Hardware malfunctions, which can generally be corrected, are more common. Stimulation-related complications are usually reversible by adjusting the stimulation. Large randomized trials are needed to determine the treatment&rsquo;s efficacy and safety. (See <a href=\"#H18783078\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DBS is an experimental procedure that has been used to treat incapacitating and treatment-refractory OCD. Given the invasive nature of DBS and the lack of efficacy data, we suggest that patients with OCD only be treated with DBS in the context of a clinical trial (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
