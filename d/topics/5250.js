CAP is a common and potentially serious illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. It is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, particularly in older adult patients and those with significant comorbidities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis of community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnostic approach to CAP in immunocompetent adults will be reviewed here. A variety of other important issues related to CAP are discussed separately. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The epidemiology and microbiology of CAP (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and microbiology of community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of sputum cultures for the evaluation of bacterial pneumonia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sputum-cultures-for-the-evaluation-of-bacterial-pneumonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sputum cultures for the evaluation of bacterial pneumonia&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to patients with nonresolving pneumonia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonresolving-pneumonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonresolving pneumonia&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment recommendations for CAP in patients treated in the outpatient setting (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-in-the-outpatient-setting\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adults in the outpatient setting&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment recommendations for CAP in patients requiring hospitalization (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-who-require-hospitalization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adults who require hospitalization&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evidence for efficacy of different antibiotic medications in the empiric treatment of CAP and issues related to drug resistance (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antibiotic-studies-for-the-treatment-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antibiotic studies for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumonia in special populations, such as aspiration pneumonia and immunocompromised patients (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspiration-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspiration pneumonia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-infections-in-immunocompromised-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary infections in immunocompromised patients&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3261777362\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of CAP generally requires the demonstration of an infiltrate on chest radiograph in a patient with a clinically compatible syndrome (eg, fever, dyspnea, cough, and sputum production).</p><p>Microbiologic testing is reserved for hospitalized patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77432\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77432 \">table 1</a>) and for selected outpatients in whom test results would change management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common clinical features of CAP include cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and sputum production. Mucopurulent sputum production is most frequently found in association with bacterial pneumonia, while scant or watery sputum production is more suggestive of an atypical pathogen. Although there are classic descriptions of certain types of sputum production and particular pathogens (eg, pneumococcal pneumonia and rust-colored sputum), these clinical descriptions do not help in clinical decision-making regarding treatment because they are rarely seen.</p><p>Other common features are gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) and mental status changes. Chest pain occurs in 30 percent of cases, chills in 40 to 50 percent, and rigors in 15 percent. Because of the rapid onset of symptoms, most individuals seek medical care within the first few days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>On physical examination, approximately 80 percent are febrile, although this finding is frequently absent in older patients, and temperature may be deceptively low in the morning due to normal diurnal variation. A respiratory rate above 24 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/minute</span> is noted in 45 to 70 percent of patients and may be the most sensitive sign in older adult patients; tachycardia is also common. Chest examination reveals audible crackles in most patients. Signs of consolidation, such as decreased or bronchial breath sounds, dullness to percussion, tactile fremitus, and egophony are present in approximately one-third.</p><p>The major blood test abnormality is leukocytosis (typically between 15,000 and 30,000 per mm<sup>3</sup>) with a leftward shift. Leukopenia can occur and generally connotes a poor prognosis.</p><p>While the clinical features outlined above support the diagnosis of pneumonia, no clear constellation of symptoms and signs has been found to accurately predict whether or not the patient has pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As an example, the sensitivity of the combination of fever, cough, tachycardia, and crackles was less than 50 percent when chest radiograph was used as a reference standard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOLOGIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of an infiltrate on plain chest radiograph is considered the gold standard for diagnosing pneumonia when clinical and microbiologic features are supportive. A chest radiograph should be obtained in patients with suspected pneumonia when possible; a demonstrable infiltrate by chest radiograph or other imaging technique is required for the diagnosis of pneumonia, according to the 2007 consensus guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Recommendations are less clear in the patient with what appears to be a viral infection with nasal congestion and cough; one approach in these cases is to obtain a chest radiograph when there is an abnormal vital sign with particular emphasis on a respiratory rate &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/minute</span> or a fever. This recommendation is relatively insensitive in older adult patients.</p><p>The radiographic appearance of CAP may include lobar consolidation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65658\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65658 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64692\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64692 \">image 2</a>), interstitial infiltrates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F51752\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51752 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62313\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62313 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61559\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61559 \">image 5</a>), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cavitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53664\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53664 \">image 6</a>). It has been taught that lobar consolidation is due to the &quot;typical&quot; bacteria, and interstitial infiltrates are due to <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> (formerly <em>P. carinii</em>) and viruses. However, radiologists cannot reliably differentiate bacterial from nonbacterial pneumonia on the basis of the radiographic appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. There is also substantial interobserver variation in the interpretation of chest radiographs in patients with possible pneumonia between different radiologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>] and between emergency room physicians and radiologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. It is also clear that high-resolution computed tomography (CT) is superior to chest radiography in detecting lesions and defining anatomical changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Nevertheless, chest radiograph (posteroanterior and lateral) is generally adequate for clinical care of most patients with CAP.</p><p>If the clinical evaluation does not support pneumonia in a patient with an abnormal chest radiograph, other causes for the radiographic abnormalities must be considered, such as malignancy, hemorrhage, pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, and inflammation secondary to noninfectious causes. On the other hand, if the clinical syndrome favors pneumonia but the radiograph is negative, the radiograph may represent a false-negative result. In some cases, this can be clarified with a CT scan, which, as noted above, has higher sensitivity and accuracy than chest radiographs for detecting CAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>There are case reports and animal experiments favoring the hypothesis that volume depletion may produce an initially negative radiograph, which &quot;blossoms&quot; into infiltrates following rehydration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In support of this hypothesis, one population-based cohort study of suspected CAP found that 7 percent of patients with negative initial radiographs developed changes consistent with CAP on repeat chest radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>For hospitalized patients with suspected pneumonia and a negative chest radiograph, the 2007 <span class=\"nowrap\">IDSA/ATS</span> consensus guidelines consider it reasonable to initiate empiric presumptive antibiotic therapy and repeat the chest radiograph in 24 to 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The basis for this recommendation is from the classic studies of pneumococcal pneumonia, which found that the absence of infiltrate at 24 hours after onset of symptoms indicated the diagnosis needed to be questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Alternatively, a CT scan could be performed in patients with a negative chest radiograph when there is a high clinical suspicion for pneumonia. CT scan, especially high-resolution CT (HRCT), is more sensitive than plain films for the evaluation of interstitial disease, bilateral disease, cavitation, empyema, and hilar adenopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16</a>].</p><p>CT scanning is not generally recommended for routine use because the data for its use in CAP are limited, the cost is high, and there is no evidence that it improves outcome. Thus, a chest radiograph is the preferred method for initial imaging, with CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reserved for further anatomical definition (eg, detecting cavitation, adenopathy, or mass lesions).</p><p>There is interest in using lung ultrasound to diagnose pneumonia, particularly in unstable patients in the emergency department or intensive care unit in whom it is difficult to obtain a good-quality chest radiograph. In two large meta-analyses, the sensitivity of lung ultrasound was approximately 80 to 90 percent and the specificity approximately 70 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. It is reasonable for those with experience performing lung ultrasounds to use this modality when a chest radiograph is not likely to be a good-quality study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC TESTING FOR MICROBIAL ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is agreement that treatment is best when it is pathogen directed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/1-3,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,19</a>], but there is little consensus on the practicality of achieving this goal due to controversies in the value of diagnostic tests.</p><p>The 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America <span class=\"nowrap\">(IDSA)/American</span> Thoracic Society (ATS) consensus guidelines recommend diagnostic testing for a specific organism when, based on clinical or epidemiologic data, pathogens that would not respond to usual empiric antibiotic regimens are suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Critical microbes'</a> below). These guidelines otherwise support the following testing strategy, based on patient characteristics and severity of illness:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For outpatients with CAP, routine diagnostic tests are optional.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospitalized patients with specific indications should have blood cultures and sputum Gram stain and culture <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other tests as outlined in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77432\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77432 \">table 1</a>); some experts consider diagnostic tests to be optional for hospitalized patients without severe CAP.

In one study of over 700 ambulatory patients treated for CAP, empiric antibiotics (a macrolide or fluoroquinolone in &gt;95 percent) were almost universally effective; only 1 percent required hospitalization due to failure of the outpatient regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The 2007 <span class=\"nowrap\">IDSA/ATS</span> consensus guidelines suggest that routine tests to identify an etiology for CAP are optional for patients who do not require hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. An exception is in clinical or epidemiologic settings suggesting a critical microbe is the etiologic agent, in which tests for a microbial diagnosis are important. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Critical microbes'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sputum-cultures-for-the-evaluation-of-bacterial-pneumonia#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sputum cultures for the evaluation of bacterial pneumonia&quot;, section on 'Community-acquired pneumonia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hospitalized patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most hospitalized patients with CAP in the United States are treated empirically with no etiologic diagnosis. A review of the experience of Medicare for 17,340 patients hospitalized for CAP in 2009 showed a microbial diagnosis was made in only 7.6 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Several reasons for this include the distancing of the laboratory from the site of care, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA; a ruling that rid hospitals of house-staff labs in 1988), a perception that the quality of microbiology as applied to sputum Gram stain and culture was variable but generally poor, the Medicare Performance Indicator policy that required administration of antibiotics within six hours of registration in emergency rooms (a requirement that has been discontinued), and a randomized trial showing that medical care outcomes were as good with empiric decisions based on guidelines as they were with pathogen-directed antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Despite these observations and realities, there is interest in increasing diagnostic microbiologic studies in CAP patients along with increased emphasis on better quality in the traditional tests and use of newer molecular techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The emphasis on pathogen-directed treatment is motivated by a desire to reduce unnecessary complications (including <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]), to limit antibiotic overuse, to reduce resistance, and to improve care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>A prospective study published in 2005 evaluated the diagnostic yield of traditional microbiologic tests in 262 hospitalized patients with CAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Clinical samples included sputum for Gram staining, culture, and detection of pneumococcal antigen, blood for culture and serologic tests, urine for <em>Legionella </em>and pneumococcal antigens, and specimens obtained by bronchoscopy.

Potential advantages are speed and enhanced sensitivity and specificity.

Among patients with a definite diagnosis of pneumococcal CAP, the sensitivity of urinary antigen testing was 78 percent compared with 57 percent in those with a probable diagnosis. A definite diagnosis was defined as <em>S. pneumoniae</em> isolated from a blood culture or pleural fluid culture or detected by PCR from pleural fluid, whereas a probable diagnosis required <em>S. pneumoniae</em> to be the predominant organism in a good quality sputum sample with an accompanying positive Gram stain. Pneumococcal CAP was diagnosed exclusively by the urinary antigen test in 75 cases (44 percent). The results of the urinary antigen test led clinicians to reduce the spectrum of antibiotics in 41 of 474 patients with CAP (9 percent).

Procalcitonin is detectable in the serum within 4 hours, and peak levels occur between 12 and 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].</p><p>Procalcitonin has been studied prospectively to facilitate the decision of whether to use antibacterial agents in patients with pneumonia and when antibiotics can be safely stopped. We consider procalcitonin a useful adjunct to the antibiotic decisions in CAP, but other observations and clinical judgment are also important.

Most patients with a diagnosis of CAP supported by imaging showing a pulmonary infiltrate will be treated with an antibiotic, but a low procalcitonin may support the impression of a viral or other nonbacterial cause. The procalcitonin may also facilitate the decision to stop antibiotics since the levels reflect bacterial replication. Other studies have shown that procalcitonin levels correlate with the severity of pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>]. In one small study, procalcitonin levels increased over time in non-survivors but decreased in survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].
