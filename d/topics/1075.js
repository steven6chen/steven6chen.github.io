The frequency of serious complications depends upon the valve type and position, and other clinical risk factors. Complications include embolic events, bleeding, valve obstruction (due to thrombosis or pannus), infective endocarditis, structural deterioration (particularly for bioprosthetic valves), paravalvular regurgitation, hemolytic anemia, and patient-prosthesis mismatch.</p><p>Thromboembolic and anticoagulation-related problems are by far the most frequent complications of mechanical valves. The long-term risk of thromboembolism is generally lower with bioprosthetic valves, though there is an increased risk of thromboembolism for bioprosthetic as well as mechanical valves early after valve implantation. </p><p>This topic will review indications for antithrombotic therapy to reduce the risk of prosthetic valve thrombosis and thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-for-prosthetic-heart-valves-indications/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].

The intensity of therapy varies with the type of valve (the risk of valve thrombosis and thromboembolism is much greater with mechanical valves), the site of valve replacement (the risk is greater with mitral than aortic valves), the presence or absence of underlying risk factors for thrombus formation, and certain clinical settings, such as pregnancy and surgical procedures. </p><p>The management of antithrombotic therapy for prosthetic valves during pregnancy is discussed separately.

Possible mechanisms for increased sensitivity include a reduction in plasma albumin, a decrease in the binding capacity of warfarin, and the use of antibiotics after surgery. Patients often require measurement of the INR two to three times per week as therapy is initiated.

The ninth ACCP guidelines suggest either subcutaneous prophylactic dose UFH or subcutaneous prophylactic or therapeutic dose LMWH for post-valve replacement bridging (rather than intravenous therapeutic UFH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76851\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76851 \">table 2</a>), based upon the results of observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-for-prosthetic-heart-valves-indications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The 2014 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACC)</span> valvular guidelines note that subcutaneous LMWH or subcutaneous or intravenous UFH are used by various centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-for-prosthetic-heart-valves-indications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the 2012 ESC guidelines, intravenous UFH or subcutaneous LMWH is suggested, the latter with anti-factor Xa monitoring to ensure therapeutic anticoagulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54908\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54908 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-for-prosthetic-heart-valves-indications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>The rationale for early bridging anticoagulation is that there is a substantial risk of thromboembolism early after valve replacement and at least five days of VKA therapy is usually required to achieve a therapeutic effect. It has been estimated that as many as one-third of patients leave the cardiac surgery unit before VKA therapy is fully effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-for-prosthetic-heart-valves-indications/abstract/6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13</a>]. Therefore, short-term bridging treatment may be indicated. On the other hand, after valve surgery, patients are susceptible to bleeding complications and to excessively high INRs because of increased sensitivity to VKA therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-for-prosthetic-heart-valves-indications/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-mechanical-prosthetic-valve-thrombosis-or-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of mechanical prosthetic valve thrombosis or obstruction&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In the early postoperative period, intravenous UFH can be readily administered because the patient is already hospitalized. However, there is concern of initial underdosing as well as potential increased bleeding at therapeutic or above therapeutic levels. Therefore, there is interest in the use of subcutaneous LMWH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-for-prosthetic-heart-valves-indications/abstract/6,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13,14</a>]. However, concerns about subcutaneous LMWH include: the effect of SQ LMWH cannot be as easily reversed as that of intravenous UFH should bleeding develop, and fixed-dose SQ LMWH may not ensure adequate anticoagulation in patients with mechanical valves, so monitoring of anti-factor Xa levels may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-for-prosthetic-heart-valves-indications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Of note, there is a substantial risk of thromboembolic events immediately following mechanical valve replacement (particularly mitral) even when bridging anticoagulation is initiated early postoperatively. In an observational study of patients who received intravenous UFH following mechanical valve replacement with early effective anticoagulation (by median day three for mitral and day four for aortic valve replacement), the rate of clinical thromboembolic events within 30 days was 0.7 percent for aortic valve replacement and 5 percent for mitral valve replacement (alone or combined with aortic valve replacement) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antithrombotic-therapy-for-prosthetic-heart-valves-indications/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Risk factors for thromboembolism included temporary cessation of anticoagulation for pacemaker implantation, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and diabetes mellitus.</p><p>Use of LMWH or UFH for bridging should be distinguished from long-term use, particularly in pregnancy, which is discussed separately.
