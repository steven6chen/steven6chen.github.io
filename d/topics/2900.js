Beginning early in the 21<sup>st </sup>century, there has also been an expansion in the indications for cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED, a term which includes PPMs and ICDs), resulting in device therapy becoming more complex and more prolonged over the patient's lifetime. As such, therapy with a CIED frequently involves multiple leads and multiple pulse generators per patient over each patient's lifetime with the device, exposing the patient to greater operative risk as well as ongoing risk related to the CIED.</p><p>There are a variety of potential complications associated with CIED use, both at and around the time of implantation as well as long-term over the life of the patient and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Procedural and peri-procedural complications associated with CIED implantation will be reviewed here. The long-term complications associated with a CIED, as well as basic principles associated with both PPMs and ICDs, are discussed separately.

However, following the establishment of the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) ICD Registry by the American College of Cardiology, information is now available for all ICDs implanted in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Unfortunately, there is no contemporary nationwide registry of pacemaker implants, although some pacemaker complications can be estimated from ICD data, such as pneumothorax rates in single and dual lead systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. </p><p>Major complications requiring reoperation or hospitalization were analyzed in a cohort of 114,484 patients aged 65 years or greater (mean age 74.8 years, 72 percent male) who were enrolled in the NCDR ICD registry and received a first ICD between 2006 and 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Rates of complications were significantly higher in women (7.2 percent compared with 4.8 percent in men; adjusted OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.3-1.5).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective review of more than 3.7 million CIED implantations over the period from 1998 to 2013, a post-procedure pneumothorax developed in 1.3 percent of patients and was more common in patients &gt;80 years old, women, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and dual-chamber CIEDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. An earlier systematic review, which included less than 5000 patients, reported a slightly lower incidence of 0.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The risk of pneumothorax is likely dependent on the implant technique used, but no data are available comparing rates of pneumothorax with different techniques.</p><p/><p>Complications can also occur during generator replacement procedures, lead revision procedures (changing or adding a lead), or lead extraction procedures. The rate of complications associated with these procedures, including infections, is an important issue for patients as well as for clinicians and patients considering early generator change due to a device advisory or recall. The reported rates of device failure in the case of an advisory or recall are usually very low, often well under one percent. As an example, in one study of 2915 patients with an ICD subject to an advisory, of whom 533 patients had a device replaced and were followed for an average of 2.7 months, 8 percent of the patients who underwent replacement had a complication, including major complications requiring reoperation in 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In comparison, during the study period, three of the devices subject to advisories experienced a malfunction (0.1 percent), with none of these malfunctions resulting in adverse clinical sequelae. Thus, even low procedure-related complication rates could outweigh the benefit of changing the device. On the other hand, several studies have shown that proactive management of these advisory components can lead to improved outcomes. As such, these types of decisions are best approached on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the individual patient scenario and the patient's preference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

Modern CIED lead systems are most commonly placed via the axillary, subclavian, or cephalic vein. Alternatively, permanent pacemaker (PPM) or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) leads may be placed on the epicardial surface (via thoracotomy). Both transvenous and epicardial leads are generally attached to a pulse generator in the pectoral region, although some pacemakers and ICDs implanted at the time of surgery are implanted in an abdominal position (with tunneled epicardial leads). </p><p>In addition to transvenous and epicardial systems, a subcutaneous ICD is also available in which the pulse generator is placed in the mid-axillary region with the lead tunneled subcutaneously and placed along the left parasternal region. Leadless pacemakers, in which a pulse generator is placed in direct contact with the right ventricular endocardium without external leads, have their own unique risks which are different than standard transvenous devices and will be discussed below.</p><p>Each option for pulse generator and lead placement carries its own set of unique potential complications. The discussion in this topic will focus on CIED systems with transvenous and epicardial leads, while information on subcutaneous ICDs and leadless pacemakers is presented separately.

Reported complication rates range from 3 to 6 percent, with up to one-half of these complications considered serious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Complications associated with transvenous CIED lead implantation include bleeding, infections, lead dislodgement, pneumothorax, air embolism, cardiac perforation, thrombosis of the implant vein, and rarely death. Most lead dislodgements and infections occur in the first three months, while lead fractures continue to occur during follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The risk of pneumothorax is a function of the venous access method; traditional subclavian access has a higher pneumothorax risk than the extrathoracic axillary vein micropuncture technique or cephalic vein access. The use of periprocedural venography to guide access can reduce the risk of complications. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1341585426\"><span class=\"h4\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perioperative mortality with transvenous CIED implantation is rare but does occasionally occur. Estimates of peri-procedural mortality have ranged from 0.2 to 0.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/4,9,14,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,14,18,19</a>]. Higher in-hospital mortality rates were observed in a cohort of 26,887 heart failure patients undergoing ICD <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) implantation. Complications were more common in older adults with rates ranging from 0.7 to 1.2 to 2.2 percent in patients aged &lt;80, 80 to 85, and &gt;85 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. When compared with those receiving a single-chamber ICD, patients receiving a dual-chamber ICD have a greater risk of complications (3.2 versus 2.1 percent, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.40, 95% CI 1.28-1.52) and in-hospital mortality (0.4 versus 0.23 percent, adjusted OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.20-1.74) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Using data from the REPLACE Registry, a prospective multicenter study of patients undergoing CIED reimplantation with two distinct cohorts (patients undergoing generator change only and patients undergoing generator change plus the placement of at least one additional lead), no significant association was identified between the rate of complications and risk of death during the initial six months post-procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, several patient characteristics (admission for heart failure within preceding 12 months, NYHA class III or IV status, antiarrhythmic drug use, chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, and advancing age) were identified that predicted mortality. Using these risk markers, the investigators created the <a href=\"http://depts.washington.edu/replace/ReplaceCalc.html&amp;token=zabqurEZHkal7+CWLysn7E+yTt1J+NWQ/uaMA9hvDsVQMwBNqOP4B784ST5/qoDy029fKKTq9MqzFZFncVh1wg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=108919\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">REPLACE DARE Mortality Risk Score</a> to predict mortality, with increasingly higher scores associated with greater risk of mortality. It is notable that in the REPLACE registry, replacement of a CRT device was associated with the highest risk of complications (19 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3645831982\"><span class=\"h4\">Cardiac perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac perforation at the time of CIED implantation, a rare complication with most estimates ranging between 0.1 and 0.4 percent of CIED procedures, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Among 440,251 first-time ICD recipients enrolled in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry between January 2006 and September 2011, only 625 cardiac perforations (0.14 percent) were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, patients with cardiac perforation had a significantly greater risk of other major complications (OR 27.5, 95% CI 19-9-38.0) and in-hospital mortality (OR 17.7, 95% CI 12.2-25.6).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1146324120\"><span class=\"h4\">Bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While most patients who undergo CIED insertion have minimal blood loss or post-operative bleeding, serious bleeding can sometimes occur. Reported bleeding rates have varied widely depending on the presence or absence of concomitant antithrombotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/14,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,25,26</a>]. In patients who are taking dual antiplatelet therapy, bleeding complications are more frequent (7.2 versus 1.6 percent in those on no antiplatelet therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. To minimize the risk of bleeding at the time of CIED insertion, we proceed as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients requiring CIED insertion who have the highest risk of thromboembolic events (greater than 5 percent per year), in whom the risk of discontinuing antithrombotic therapy is thought to exceed the risks of post-procedural bleeding, [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] we recommend continuation of chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> therapy rather than a bridging strategy using heparin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a lower risk of thromboembolic events (5 percent per year or less) who require CIED insertion, there are no outcomes data to guide the decision to continue or temporarily suspend antithrombotic therapy at the time of the procedure. Based on individualized assessment of risks and benefits, some of our experts feel that it is reasonable to discontinue antithrombotic therapy two days prior to the procedure and, in the absence of any post-procedure bleeding, resume antithrombotic therapy on the day following the procedure. Other experts feel that it is reasonable to continue antithrombotic therapy without interruption in selected patients. Either approach should be taken without any bridging anticoagulation. Until outcomes data are available regarding strategies for management of anticoagulation management in low-risk patients, clinicians should make individualized decisions with the patient based on the estimated risk of post-procedural bleeding on antithrombotic therapy versus risk of a thromboembolic event during a short period of time off of antithrombotic therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who are taking a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), the optimal management strategy is not yet defined. While some operators attempt these procedures without interruption of NOAC, most clinicians stop the NOAC 24 to 48 hours before and resume therapy 24 to 72 hours after the procedure. Given the short half-lives of NOAC agents, there is no rationale for bridging therapy.</p><p/><p>The BRUISE CONTROL investigators performed the largest randomized trial of antithrombotic treatment strategies in patients undergoing CIED insertion. Among 681 patients with an annualized risk of thromboembolic events of 5 percent or greater and taking long-term <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, those randomized to device insertion while on continued warfarin therapy had a significantly lower incidence of the primary outcome (clinically significant pocket hematoma requiring prolonged hospital stay, interruption of anticoagulation therapy, or surgery for hematoma removal) compared with those whose warfarin was stopped and heparin-bridging therapy used (3.5 versus 16 percent; relative risk 0.19; 95% CI 0.10-0.36) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Two subsequent meta-analyses have shown findings consistent with BRUISE CONTROL, including a 2014 meta-analysis that included 3744 patients from 14 studies (including BRUISE CONTROL and four other prospective randomized trials) and found that heparin bridging was associated with a significantly higher risk of bleeding compared with continuation of anticoagulation (hazard ratio 3.1; 95% CI 2.0-4.8) with no significant reduction in thromboembolic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Based on this, we recommend continuation of chronic warfarin therapy rather than a bridging strategy using heparin for patients at high risk of thromboembolic events who undergo CIED insertion.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dabigatran</a>, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a>, a factor Xa inhibitor, have limited data available regarding bleeding risk during CIED insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective, single-center, observational study of 48 patients undergoing CIED implantation or revision while taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a> (25 new system implants, 14 generator replacements, 9 generator replacements with associated lead revisions), bleeding complications were reported in only 1 of 48 patients (2.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Also of note, the incidence of bleeding complications was not significantly different from a second group of 195 patients who underwent CIED implantation or revision while taking uninterrupted <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (nine bleeding complications [4.6 percent]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective, single-center, observational study of 176 patients undergoing CIED implantation while taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a> (93 patients) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a> (83 patients), bleeding complications were infrequent, with only two complications (2 percent; two pocket hematomas) in patients taking dabigatran and only four complications (5 percent; three pocket hematomas and one pericardial effusion) in patients taking rivaroxaban [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p/><p>While these data are promising that CIED implantation can be performed with uninterrupted direct thrombin or factor Xa inhibitors, additional studies are needed prior to routinely recommending this in practice. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1169290489\"><span class=\"h4\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection of the generator pocket or leads can occur at the time of CIED implantation or at any subsequent time. Because infection of a CIED can be a life-threatening problem, complete removal of the CIED pulse generator and all leads, along with antibiotic therapy, are strongly recommended for essentially all patients. In very rare instances, a patient may elect to proceed with antibiotic therapy without hardware removal. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infections involving cardiac implantable electronic devices&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac implantable electronic device lead removal&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among a cohort of 200,909 patients enrolled in an ICD registry with implant between 2006 and 2009, 1.7 percent (3390 patients) developed an infection within six months post-implantation, with a higher incidence in pulse generator replacements than in initial implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The rate of CIED infection appears to be significantly higher among patients on dialysis, estimated at 8 percent of all patients with an indwelling CIED (including pacemakers and ICDs) who were receiving dialysis between 2005 and 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The incidence of early CIED infection appears to be lower with perioperative antibiotics, with the transvenous rather than the epicardial approach, and with pectoral implantation rather than abdominal implantation. There are several additional prophylactic interventions being tested in clinical trials, including the use of an absorbable antibiotic pouch that is placed around the device in the pacemaker or ICD pocket [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1363395450\"><span class=\"h3\">Epicardial lead systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the vast majority of patients, transvenous CIED leads can be placed quickly, without general anesthesia, and with relatively little morbidity. Because of this, transvenous lead placement has largely replaced epicardial lead placement, which requires a thoracotomy, general anesthesia, and a longer recovery. However, epicardial leads remain an option for patients with complicated vascular access or active bloodstream infection in which the placement of transvenous leads may be contraindicated.</p><p>Given the relative infrequency with which epicardial leads are placed, there are no data available on the frequency of complications from epicardial lead placement with modern devices. Epicardial lead placement is associated with appreciable mortality and with complications that are unique to thoracotomy and epicardial lead systems, such as the postpericardiotomy syndrome (postcardiac injury syndrome), pleural effusion, erosion of epicardial patches, constrictive pericarditis, and atrial arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

These complaints, more common with sub-pectoral CIED placement rather than subcutaneous CIED placement, usually do not require additional intervention or surgical revision and often abate by 12 months after insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Furthermore, the smaller size of modern pulse generators has made device-related shoulder problems extremely rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1835412329\"><span class=\"h2\">Operator characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As indications for CIED implantation expand and more patients are receiving CIEDs during their lifetimes, devices are being implanted by larger numbers of clinicians with a wide range of procedural volumes and with different board certifications. In general, complications and mortality decrease as the implanting provider's volume of implantations increases, regardless of specialty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cohort of 9854 Medicare patients who underwent ICDs implantation by 1672 clinicians, the annual implant volume ranged from 1 to 87 devices (median seven implants per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. While there was no correlation between operator volume and periprocedural mortality, 90-day rates of mechanical complications (7 versus 4.4 percent) and ICD infection (1.3 versus 0.6 percent) were significantly higher among clinicians in the lowest quartile of implant volume compared with those in the highest. However, once a threshold of 11 implants per year was reached, the overall complication rate was no longer dependent upon volume.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective cohort study using data from a national ICD registry, which included 111,293 patients who underwent initial transvenous ICD placement by 2128 clinicians in 1062 hospitals between January 2006 and June 2007, implanting providers were classified according to one of four categories of board certification: electrophysiologists, non-electrophysiologist cardiologists, thoracic surgeons, and other specialists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Notably, patients were excluded if their clinician submitted fewer than 10 ICD procedures, if they were 18 years old or younger, if they had a prior ICD implantation, or if they had an epicardial lead placed. Clinicians who were board certified in electrophysiology placed 71 percent of ICDs and had the lowest rates of overall and major complications (3.5 and 1.3 percent, respectively), while thoracic surgeons placed 1.7 percent of ICDs and had significantly higher rates of overall and major complications (5.8 and 2.5 percent). Some of the higher rates of complications in the surgical cases may be due to the tendency of surgical cases to be sicker patients.

For patients in whom placement of a new lead is not required, lead related complications are uncommon. Infections are more common following generator change than initial implant. (See <a href=\"#H1169290489\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> above.)</p><p>The REPLACE Registry was a prospective multicenter study of patients undergoing CIED reimplantation with two distinct cohorts, patients undergoing generator change only (1031 patients) and patients undergoing generator change plus the placement of at least one additional lead (713 patients), who were followed for six months post-procedure to assess for complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Major complications occurred in only 41 patients (4 percent) of the generator-only cohort as compared with 109 patients (15 percent) of the generator plus lead cohort.</p><p>Subsequently, investigators reevaluated the patients from the REPLACE Registry in an effort to identify risk factors related to mortality within the six months post-procedure, ultimately identifying several patient characteristics (admission for heart failure within preceding 12 months, NYHA class III or IV status, antiarrhythmic drug use, chronic kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, and advancing age) were identified that predicted mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-peri-procedural-complications/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H750089083\"><span class=\"h1\">PERI-PROCEDURAL MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients who undergo CIED implantation will have the device placed using local anesthesia at the site of the pulse generator insertion, with procedural sedation provided for patients in whom anxiety or pain control is needed.

Reported implant complication rates range from 3 to 6 percent, although the exact incidence of peri-procedural CIED complications is difficult to determine due to inconsistent definitions and the lack of mandatory reporting. (See <a href=\"#H322239850\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications associated with transvenous CIED lead implantation include bleeding, infections, lead dislodgement, pneumothorax, cardiac perforation, and rarely death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Perioperative mortality with transvenous CIED implantation is rare, but does occasionally occur, with estimates of peri-procedural mortality ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 percent. (See <a href=\"#H1341585426\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cardiac perforation at the time of CIED implantation is rare, occurring in only 0.1 to 0.2 percent of patients, but is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"#H3645831982\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac perforation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>While most patients who undergo cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) insertion have minimal blood loss or post-operative bleeding, serious bleeding can sometimes occur. To minimize the risk of bleeding, chronic antithrombotic therapy should be discontinued prior to device insertion whenever possible, although this may not be an option for those at the highest risk of thromboembolic events. (See <a href=\"#H1146324120\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients requiring CIED insertion who have the highest risk of thromboembolic events (greater than 5 percent per year), in whom the risk of discontinuing antithrombotic therapy is thought to exceed the risks of post-procedural bleeding, we recommend continuation of chronic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> therapy rather than a bridging strategy using heparin (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients with a lower risk of thromboembolic events (5 percent per year or less) who require CIED insertion, some of our experts feel that it is reasonable to discontinue antithrombotic therapy two days prior to the procedure and, in the absence of any post-procedure bleeding, resume antithrombotic therapy on the day following the procedure. Other experts feel that it is reasonable to continue antithrombotic therapy without interruption in selected patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>In patients who are taking a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), the optimal management strategy is not yet defined. While some operators attempt these procedures without interruption of NOAC, most clinicians stop the NOAC 24 to 48 hours before and resume therapy 24 to 72 hours after the procedure. Given the short half-lives of NOAC agents, there is no rationale for bridging therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infection of the generator pocket or leads can occur at the time of CIED implantation or at any subsequent time, having been reported in up to 2 percent of patients within six months post-procedure. The incidence of early CIED infection appears to be lower with perioperative antibiotics, with the transvenous rather than the epicardial approach, and with pectoral implantation, and higher in patients on hemodialysis. (See <a href=\"#H1169290489\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following CIED implantation, a PA and lateral chest radiograph should be obtained to establish the position of the pulse generator and the associated lead(s) and to exclude any apparent complications, including pneumothorax and lead dislodgment.
