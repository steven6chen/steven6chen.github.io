Long-term survivors are at risk for developing second malignancies, cardiovascular disease (eg, due to anthracycline toxicity or mediastinal radiation), pulmonary disease (eg, due to radiation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>), thyroid dysfunction, sterility, and other complications.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the second malignancies that are commonly seen in patients who have been treated for HL.

These second cancers have a significant impact on survival from HL. The relative risk of developing a second malignancy has varied greatly among studies and is dependent upon a number of patient and treatment factors, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation dose and fields</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy agents and doses administered</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient age at treatment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Length of time after treatment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking history</p><p/><p>In addition to these factors, certain patients may have a genetic predisposition towards developing second malignancies after treatment of HL. As an example, a genome-wide association study in survivors of HL treated with radiotherapy reported that patients with certain single nucleotide polymorphisms at chromosome 6q21 were more likely to develop a second malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Further study of candidate genes in this region may reveal new data regarding the pathogenesis of second malignancies in this population. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Relative and absolute risks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Solid tumors account for the majority of second cancers in HL survivors, with breast, lung, and gastrointestinal cancer being the most frequent. NHL is less common, but occurs much more frequently in this population when compared with the general population (ie, high relative risk). With modern chemotherapy regimens, the risk of acute myelogenous leukemia is lower.</p><p>The estimated overall relative risks in 11 large cohort studies were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukemia &ndash; 10 to 80-fold</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma &ndash; 3- to 35-fold</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Solid tumors (lung, breast, bone, stomach, colon, thyroid, melanoma) &ndash; Over twofold</p><p/><p>Leukemia and NHL are diseases with a low incidence in the general population; as a result, an increase in their relative risk following the treatment of HL (ie, up to 80-fold) does not translate into a high likelihood of developing leukemia or NHL. In addition, the risk of leukemia in this study reflects the use of chemotherapy regimens, such as MOPP and <span class=\"nowrap\">MOPP/ABVD,</span> which are no longer the standard of care. On the other hand, even though the relative risk of developing a solid tumor is lower (ie, twofold), the cumulative number of solid tumors that develop over the entire follow-up period is much higher than the number of cases of leukemia or NHL, because the incidence of solid tumors in the general population is so much higher (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57099 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The absolute number of second cancers in patients with HL that may be attributable to treatment (ie, excess cases) is 40 to 90 malignancies per 10,000 patients per year (0.4 to 0.7 percent per year) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57099 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/6-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-12</a>]. Several retrospective case series have reported an actuarial risk of second cancer of 11 to 18 percent at 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]; 20 percent at 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]; 28 percent at 25 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]; and 33 percent at 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>A combined analysis of three large studies including 6292 patients showed that, in the period of 10 or more years after first treatment, lung cancer contributed most to the absolute excess cancer risk, with 34 excess cases per 10,000 HL patients per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/7,8,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,13</a>]. NHL <span class=\"nowrap\">(28/10,000</span> per year) was second, and leukemia <span class=\"nowrap\">(10/10,000</span> per year) third. In women, breast cancer accounted for the largest absolute excess risk <span class=\"nowrap\">(40/10,000</span> per year) in 10-year survivors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of elapsed time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The elapsed time from initial treatment affects both the risk of death due to Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and the risk of developing a second cancer.</p><p>Most deaths due to HL occur in the first 5 to 10 years, while most of the later deaths are due to other causes (eg, cardiac, second malignancy). The cumulative incidence of mortality from HL is exceeded by all other causes after 14 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F71648\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71648 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Although death from HL abates with time, the absolute excess risk of mortality from other causes remains elevated, with no apparent diminution of the excess risk beyond 20 to 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/4,11,15,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11,15,17,18</a>]. Of importance, the risk of death from HL varies according to the stage of HL at presentation with death from HL increasing with increased stage disease. As such, the time point at which death due to treatment-related complications exceeds that of death due to HL varies by stage at diagnosis.</p><p>Different tumor types demonstrate distinct temporal patterns of development with respect to the elapsed time from initial treatment of HL. In patients receiving alkylator based regimens such as escalated BEACOPP or second line chemotherapy and high dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (rescue) in patients with recurrent disease, the risk of developing leukemia peaks at five to nine years post treatment, whereas solid tumors typically develop after a latency period of at least 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In one series, the median time to onset of acute leukemia, NHL, and solid tumors was 5, 7.3 and 12.2 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Because of this the relative and absolute excess risks in survivors at a particular time point since therapy differ greatly from those observed in the entire patient population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of treatment given</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of developing a second cancer differs greatly depending upon the treatment administered. As an example, ABVD chemotherapy is not associated with the development of secondary leukemia. In contrast, the German regimen escalated BEACOPP and second-line chemotherapy and high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant are associated with increased risk, primarily due to the use of chemotherapy that includes alkylating agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procarbazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>). In contrast, the development of secondary lung cancer appears to be related to the use of radiotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy.</p><p>Efforts have been made to shift treatment practice to chemotherapy regimens that are less carcinogenic and radiation fields and doses that limit exposure. As an example, radiation therapy fields used for HL have decreased over the years from total lymphoid irradiation to involved-field irradiation to involved-nodal irradiation.</p><p>However, retrospective series have noted a decrease in long-term toxicities and non-HL related deaths as treatment patterns have changed to reduce the exposure of patients to radiation and certain chemotherapy agents.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 2498 patients treated at Stanford between 1960 and 1995, the absolute excess risk of death from causes other than HL was lower in patients treated between 1980 and 1995 compared with those treated earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In our series of 1319 patients with HL, the relative risk for development of a second malignancy was significantly higher with combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RR 6.1) than with radiation therapy alone (RR 4.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This risk increased with increasing radiation field size in patients who received combined modality therapy, suggesting that the risk may be reduced with smaller radiation fields, as are used in current trials of abbreviated chemotherapy and limited-field radiation therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another series of 5798 patients with HL treated in Britain between 1963 and 2001, the relative risk of developing a second malignancy was higher with combined chemotherapy plus radiation therapy (RR 3.9) than with chemotherapy alone (RR 2.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Among patients treated with chemotherapy alone, the excess second malignancies were leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and lung cancer. In this population, the excess risk peaked five to nine years after chemotherapy administration and was close to baseline by 15 years. In contrast, combine chemotherapy plus radiation therapy was associated with several other types of second malignancy and the excess risk remained for 25 years or longer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective analysis of 3905 patients with HL treated in the Netherlands between 1965 and 2000 and followed for a median of 19 years, 1055 second cancers were diagnosed in 908 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Unlike in the studies above, the cumulative incidence of second solid tumor did not differ by treatment period. The risk of breast cancer was lower following supradiaphragmatic field radiotherapy not including the axilla when compared with complete mantle-field radiotherapy (hazard ratio 0.37) and was lower with higher cumulative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procarbazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procarbazine</a> dose. In contrast, less extensive supradiaphragmatic field radiotherapy was not associated with lower lung cancer rates. However, the standardization of much smaller radiation fields (ie, involved site and involved node radiation) and doses did not occur until after the patients in this study were treated. As such, this study did not assess whether or not modern techniques associated with less radiation exposure result in lower cancer risks. &#160; &#160; &#160;</p><p/><p>This decrease in long-term toxicities with changes in treatment patterns has also been supported by studies that suggest that multivariate modeling may allow for the development of an individual risk assessment of second tumor risk after HL treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient survival after the diagnosis of a second cancer is generally poor. In our series, the five-year survival rate after the development of a second malignancy was 38 percent, with the worst prognosis seen in those developing acute leukemia or lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients who develop acute leukemia or a myelodysplastic syndrome have a two-year survival rate of approximately 10 percent, while those who develop NHL or a solid tumor have five- and 10-year survival rates of approximately 32 and 23 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Similarly, in another study, the median survival from diagnosis of second tumor was approximately 42 months and was especially poor in patients developing a second cancer following a HL diagnosis at the age of 40 years or older (median survival: approximately one year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Second cancers have a significant impact upon survival from HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/6,9,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,22</a>]. The range of findings can be illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 20-year follow-up study of almost 1300 patients (median follow-up 9.2 years) who were treated between 1966 and 1986, the cumulative risk of dying from HL or acute treatment toxicity was 33 percent, while the risk of dying from a second cancer was 14 percent and that from all other causes was 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Virtually identical findings were noted in a report from the International Database on Hodgkin's Disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The overall probability of 20-year survival in 14,315 patients with HL who were treated between 1960 and 1987 (average follow-up 6.7 years) was 50 percent; 37 percent died from HL or acute treatment toxicity, and 10 percent died from a second cancer.</p><p/><p>Patients who develop a second cancer are also at risk of developing a third cancer. In one series of 3122 Dutch patients treated for HL between 1965 and 1995 and followed for a median of 23 years, 832 developed a second malignancy and 126 developed a third [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The median time from HL to second malignancy was 19 years and from second to third was four years. Cancer screening in long-term survivors of HL is discussed separately.

The reported incidence of NHL in large series of HL survivors has ranged from 0.9 percent at an average follow-up of 6.7 years (0.6 percent in the subset in continuous complete remission) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/9,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,24</a>] to 1.6 percent at 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The relative risk for NHL progressively increased with follow-up time in most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/6,8,9,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,9,25</a>] but not all studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/7,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,26</a>]. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma is the most common histology, accounting for 78 percent of the cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The largest experience comes from the International Database on Hodgkin's Disease, which evaluated the course of 12,411 patients with an average follow-up of 6.7 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. One hundred-six cases of NHL were observed with a continuous increase in relative risk with follow up in males (from 28.2 during the five- to nine-year period, to 120 during the 15- to 19-year period). In females, the risk increase was confined to the first 15 years, with a peak relative risk of 45.4 during the five- to nine-year observation period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is little agreement on definitive risk factors for NHL in patients treated for HL. It is possible that differences among studies represent differences in the patient populations examined. It is also possible that pathologic misclassification may confound the results, with recurrent HL being misdiagnosed as NHL or NHL being initially misdiagnosed as HL. This issue is of lesser concern when modern histopathologic techniques are used. Only a few studies have included expert review of the original tissue diagnosis as part of the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/7,13,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13,24</a>]. The risk of NHL appears to have declined over the past decade, perhaps related to the use of less immunosuppressive chemotherapy regimens in the initial treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma. In our experience, second NHLs seen after modern treatment regimens for HL are more likely to be low grade subtypes; a greater frequency of high grade NHL was seen previously when more immunosuppressive regimens were used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment modality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are conflicting data concerning the impact of initial treatment modality on the risk of subsequent NHL. Several studies have found no apparent differences in increased risk between patients treated with chemotherapy alone, radiotherapy alone, or a combination modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/7,8,10,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,10,26</a>]. However, other reports suggested an increased risk with combined modality treatment and treatment for relapse. A large International Database study included 106 patients who developed NHL; combined modality treatment and any type of treatment for relapse were associated with increased risk for NHL with relative risks of 2.2 to 4.5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Host factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are also conflicting data on the importance of host factors such as gender and age on the risk for NHL. Some studies noted no relationship between these factors and NHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], while the International Database and report from the Netherlands Cancer Institute found that increasing age over 30 and, to a lesser degree, male sex were risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Tumor factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of NHL may be related in part to the diagnosis of HL itself rather than its treatment. In particular, the histologic subtype of HL and the immunosuppressive effects of HL may influence the risk of NHL.</p><p>The risk of developing NHL differs among patients with different HL histologies, with the greatest risk for NHL occurring in patients with nodular lymphocyte predominant disease (NLPHL) and the lowest risk in patients with nodular sclerosis (NSHL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/9,13,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13,27,28</a>]. In one study, for example, the relative risk of NHL among HL survivors compared with the general population was 55.6 with NLPHL compared with 9.8 with NSHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In another report, NHL occurred in 22 of 3033 patients with HL randomized into clinical trials by the British National Lymphoma Investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The frequency of NHL ranged from 3.8 percent in NLPHL to 0.3 percent in NSHL. It has been suggested that the transformation to NHL may be part of the natural history of NLPHL, rather than being related to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Alternatively, it is often difficult to distinguish NLPHL from NHL, and in some cases the &quot;secondary NHL&quot; may simply be a recurrence of the initial disease.</p><p>In addition, HL may be associated with a general state of immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], which can predispose to the development of NHL as in transplant recipients. Support for this hypothesis comes from a detailed study of 14 patients who developed NHL within a median of 136 months from the diagnosis of HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The high prevalence of extranodal sites, histology of either intermediate- or high-grade lymphomas, and immunophenotypic findings typical of NHL of B cell lineage patients were similar to those of NHL arising in immunosuppressed patients.

Taken together, these results suggest that hormonal stimulation may promote tumorigenesis in patients with HL after RT has produced an initiating event. These results also suggest that treatment with preventative agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> might provide a strategy to reduce breast cancer incidence in high risk patients. An ongoing randomized trial comparing low dose tamoxifen versus placebo is evaluating this question (NCT00165308).</p><p>There are few data available on the effects of reproductive history, hormone supplementation, or genotype on the radiotherapy-related risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. The risk for developing breast cancer was nearly doubled in women treated for HL who had a first-degree relative with breast cancer, compared to those without a positive family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Patients with second cancers appear to be younger with a higher incidence of bilateral disease than women with primary breast cancer. The median age at diagnosis is 30 to 40 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/50,69,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,69,79</a>], while 20 to 25 percent have bilateral disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,80</a>].</p><p>Breast cancer that develops after treatment for HL may display more aggressive biologic characteristics when compared with sporadic cases of breast cancer. There have been several small hospital-based case-control and case-series evaluating the pathologic features of breast cancer in HL survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/79-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-84</a>].</p><p>The largest study was an analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database which included 2645 female patients who were diagnosed with HL before age 35, treated with radiation therapy as part of their initial therapy between 1973 and 2000, and survived at least five years from initial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. When compared with the general population, these patients had a sixfold increased risk of developing invasive breast cancer. The majority was ductal adenocarcinoma (79 percent) and developed in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. When compared with sporadic breast cancers, these tumors were more likely to display features associated with poor outcome such as estrogen and progesterone receptor negativity and high grade. Other studies have not seen these differences. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis of patients who develop breast cancer after treatment of HL is variable, but appears to be worse overall than that of patients who develop breast cancer de novo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. However, because of the heightened awareness of the breast cancer risk, some studies have shown that these tumors are picked up at an early stage, and have a good prognosis despite the presence of poor prognostic features. The prognosis is dependent upon nodal status at presentations, as in patients with primary breast cancer. As an example, a study at Harvard Medical School evaluating MRI versus mammography has detected 16 breast cancers; only one patient had node positive disease suggesting a relatively good prognosis for patients who develop breast cancer that is detected by careful surveillance after treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma.</p><p>In one series, for example, the five-year disease-free survival rates were much higher for patients with node-negative tumors compared with those with axillary involvement (85 versus 33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

In addition, the tumor aggressiveness appears to vary.

One prospective trial for patients who were under 35 at treatment demonstrated that the use of MRI, in addition to screening mammograms in this high risk population, identified additional breast cancers when compared with mammography alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p>Small prospective trials and retrospective analyses have demonstrated that screening programs can detect breast cancers in this population at an early stage. As an example, a prospective study of 90 female long-term survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, all of whom had been treated with mantle irradiation, included patient questionnaires concerning awareness of the increased risk for breast cancer, written recommendations for breast examination and mammography, and annual follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Ten women developed 12 breast cancers during the study.

The median age at the time of primary cancer diagnosis and presumed age at mediastinal radiation was 24 years. A total of 247 screening MRI examinations were performed over nine years. Suspicious lesions were detected on 27 MRI images (11 percent) among 21 patients, 30 of which were biopsied. Ten breast cancers were diagnosed; of these, four were detected by MRI alone, three were identifiable on MRI and mammography, while three were detected with mammography alone. These results suggest that MRI may provide additional information to that obtained by mammography, but cannot be used in place of screening mammography in this population.</p><p>A prospective trial at Harvard Medical School performed annual breast MRI and mammogram over a three-year period in 148 women who had been treated with chest irradiation for HL at age 35 years or younger and were greater than eight years beyond therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Of 63 biopsies performed in 45 women, 18 (29 percent) detected a malignancy, all but one of which were preinvasive or subcentimeter node-negative disease. MRI detected five breast cancers that were missed by mammography, while mammography detected six breast cancers missed by MRI. MRI was associated with a higher false positive rate and led to more negative biopsies than mammography. Screening with MRI, mammogram, or both was associated with sensitivities of 67, 68, and 94 percent and specificities of 94, 93, and 90 percent, respectively, for the detection of breast cancer.</p><p>Outside of a clinical trial, our practice is to perform annual mammography in women treated with mantle irradiation starting 8 to 10 years after treatment or at age 40, whichever is first [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. For patients who were 30 or younger at treatment, we recommend an annual breast MRI as an adjunct to mammography. The American Cancer Society and American College of Radiology and the Society for Breast Imaging have recommended magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening in Hodgkin lymphoma survivors at high risk for breast cancer, such as those who received radiation to the chest between the ages of 10 and 35 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78361\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78361 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-malignancies-after-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/96-98\" class=\"abstract_t\">96-98</a>].

Either of these more intensive screening methods would be expected to increase the rate of false positives. However, earlier detection by such intense screening may also allow a subgroup to avoid cytotoxic drugs and further exposure to radiation.
