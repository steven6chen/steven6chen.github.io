Advances in computer technology and technical refinements have enabled the development of more sophisticated electrodiagnostic methods, which are providing information on the motor nerve and its function in health and disease. Motor unit number estimation (MUNE) is a technique that can be used to determine the approximate number of motor neurons in a muscle or group of muscles. In addition, MUNE methods provide a means of measuring motor unit size, enabling tracking of both loss of motor units and the compensatory phenomenon of collateral reinnervation. MUNE is used most often in neuromuscular disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy.</p><p>This topic will review the methodology and utility of MUNE. Other electrodiagnostic methods are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nerve conduction studies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electromyography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electromyography&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14704712\"><span class=\"h1\">BASIC PRINCIPLES OF MOTOR NERVE FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The peripheral nerve is a collection of individual fibers, or axons, bundled together in much the same fashion as individual telephone lines within a telephone cable. Most peripheral nerves are mixed nerves, containing both sensory axons (carrying information from peripheral sensory receptors to the sensory ganglions) and motor axons (carrying commands for muscle contraction from the spinal cord to the muscle). Routine nerve conduction studies (NCS) can selectively test both the sensory axons (sensory NCS) and motor axons (motor NCS). Sensory NCS enable relatively selective stimulation and recording of sensory action potentials in a peripheral nerve, but, although they are a critical part of routine electrodiagnosis, they have little relevance to the assessment of motor function.</p><p>Each spinal motor neuron and the axon it supplies, with all of its branches and their innervated muscle fibers, is known as a motor unit. When the healthy motor axon is depolarized, all of its branches and muscle fibers are activated in an all-or-none fashion. Most peripheral nerves contain hundreds of motor axons, each of which supplies a small percentage of the total number of muscle fibers within a muscle. For full contraction of that muscle and full strength, all of the motor units in that muscle must be activated together. When minimal force is needed for a delicate task, only one or a few motor units are activated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14704719\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES OF MOTOR NERVE FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During standard motor nerve conduction studies (NCS), bipolar electrodes at the skin surface stimulate the nerve strongly enough to activate all of the motor axons within it, resulting in full depolarization and contraction of the muscle, which corresponds with activation of all of its motor units and component muscle fibers. The electrical impulse generated by this muscle activity is recorded by electrodes placed over the muscle on the skin surface. In a healthy muscle, all the motor units and all their muscle fibers are activated simultaneously during this test, generating the compound motor action potential (CMAP), which is the maximum motor response. The amplitude of the CMAP corresponds to the total number of motor units and muscle fibers activated. The time required for transmission from the stimulation site to the recording site and generation of a waveform is measured, and the conduction velocity can be calculated.</p><p>Since the size of the CMAP during maximal stimulation is determined by the electrical activity generated by all of the functional motor units within a given nerve, the approximate number of individual motor units within that nerve (MUNE) may be calculated if the average size of a single motor unit in that population is known. As an example, it is possible to calculate the number of identical wooden blocks stacked in a large square pile without removing any blocks from the pile if a single block identical to the blocks in the pile is available for examination. By measuring the height, width, and depth of the pile as a whole, and then measuring the same parameters in the sample block, the areas for both the pile and the block can be calculated. The total number of blocks in the pile can then be derived by dividing the total pile area by the area for the individual block. Similarly, if the pile consists of blocks of different sizes, the same equation can be used to estimate the number of blocks in the pile if a range of sample blocks (corresponding to the true range of the blocks in the pile) can be examined. In this case, the area of each of the individual sample blocks is determined and then averaged to yield a representative average block size. The total pile area is then divided by this value to obtain the approximate number of blocks in the pile. Other parameters, such as amplitude, can be used (in place of area) to yield similar results. </p><p>To calculate a MUNE, a waveform or value representing the average size of a single motor unit within that nerve is needed in addition to the CMAP. Different methods have been devised to calculate this single motor unit size data. One method uses selective stimulation of individual axons to generate an average single motor unit action potential (SMUAP) waveform for measure, while others use more or less complex approaches. Once the CMAP and average single motor unit data are obtained, the MUNE is calculated by the following formula:</p><p>MUNE = Maximum motor response <span class=\"nowrap\">/Average</span> single motor unit response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14704726\"><span class=\"h1\">MUNE METHODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Standard electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies provide valuable data regarding disease type, severity, and localization at a given point in time, but are less effective at measuring motor unit loss over time once a disease process has been identified. MUNE techniques provide a reproducible measure of the number of functional motor axons in the nerves of a living subject, yielding important information for the study of many neuromuscular diseases. For use in clinical practice, MUNE techniques need to be practical in terms of data collection and applicable to stages of diseases that affect motor nerves. The MUNE methods generally are most practical in assessing small strap muscles such as intrinsic foot or hand muscles. However, investigators have expanded the technique to study larger, more proximal muscles such as trapezius [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and biceps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Virtually all MUNE methods measure the action potentials associated with both the maximum motor response and the single motor unit response. The available MUNE techniques differ principally in the way they derive the average single motor unit action potential (SMUAP) size. Numerous methods for MUNE have been devised, and the major active techniques include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incremental stimulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple point stimulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multipoint incremental stimulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Statistical methods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor unit number index (MUNIX)</p><p/><p>Earlier MUNE methods include the analysis of F-waves and the use of the electromyographic signal in a technique called spike-triggered averaging (STA), which can be enhanced using a program called decomposition MUNE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Newer methods such as high-density surface EMG may have potential for widespread applicability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The major active MUNE methods are described in the sections that follow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14704735\"><span class=\"h2\">Incremental stimulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incremental stimulation method was the first described technique for MUNE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and remains the most widely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. With routine motor nerve conduction studies (NCS), if nerve stimulation is very gradually increased from the threshold stimulation until maximal stimulation is achieved (ie, depolarization of all axons), the size of the compound motor action potential (CMAP) will gradually increase in small incremental steps, until the maximal CMAP waveform is generated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F51481\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51481 \">figure 1</a>). The incremental method assumes that each small incremental increase in waveform size (incremental step) represents the activation and addition of another single motor unit to the growing waveform. Under this assumption, the amplitude of each of these waveform increments corresponds to a single motor unit action potential (SMUAP) in size. The amplitude of these increments is then averaged to yield an average SMUAP size for use in the MUNE equation. The incremental MUNE technique was soon applied to upper extremity muscles supplied by the median, ulnar, and radial nerves with motor unit counts averaging between approximately 250 and 420 in young subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p>A problem for the incremental stimulation method occurs when two motor axons in the stimulated nerve have such similar activation stimulation thresholds that they are alternately activated as stimulus intensity increases, rather than summating. This alternation between the two units, rather than sequential summation (ie, activation of SMUAP 1 alone at a lower stimulus level, followed by alternate activation of SMUAP 2 without also activating SMUAP 1 at a slightly higher stimulus level, as opposed to sequential activation of SMUAP 1, then SMUAP 1 and SMUAP 2 together), results in changes in incremental CMAP waveform amplitude that are not representative of a single motor unit discharge. In these cases, the CMAP amplitude change that occurs with increasing stimulus intensity is artifactually low and may even be negative.</p><p>This technical problem of alternation has motivated the creation of the multiple point stimulation and statistical MUNE methods to derive SMUAP size, as discussed in next sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14704742\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiple point stimulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The multiple point (or multipoint) stimulation (MPS) method was initially devised as a means of overcoming the problem of alternation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/10-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-17</a>]. In this method, the nerve is stimulated at several different sites at low-enough intensity to activate single motor axons, allowing direct recording of waveforms generated by single motor units. The amplitude or area of a group of these single motor unit action potential (SMUAP) waveforms is then averaged to provide an average SMUAP size for calculation of MUNE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60164\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60164 \">figure 2</a>). A number of modifications of this method have been proposed and tested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. A potential limitation of this technique is that it may be biased towards the most easily stimulated motor units, limiting its ability to sample the full range of motor unit within the population of a given muscle. However, this remains controversial, and MPS MUNE has proven reproducible as a technique in both normal patients and those with neuromuscular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. A major drawback of MPS MUNE is that it cannot assess larger proximal muscles such as the biceps brachii or tibialis anterior because the proximal nerves provide an inadequate number of stimulation sites to collect an adequate sample of SMUAPs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H764616\"><span class=\"h2\">Multipoint incremental method</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The multipoint incremental method is a simple combination of both incremental and multiple point MUNE methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. For each muscle, nerves are stimulated at three locations, with three increments obtained at each location. The average single motor unit action potential (SMUAP) is obtained by adding the amplitude of the third increment at each location and dividing by nine, while the MUNE is determined by dividing the SMUAP in the maximum compound muscle action potential (CMAP). &#160;</p><p>The main advantages of multipoint incremental method are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It reduces the subjectivity inherent in both incremental and multiple point methods</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The predefined stimulus positions improve test-retest variability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It can be performed using any electromyography machine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is performed rapidly with good patient acceptability</p><p/><p>When this method was employed in a multicenter natural history study of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the rate of MUNE decline and the test-retest variability compared favorably with previously described MUNE methods, making the multipoint incremental method a potentially powerful assessment tool for use in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14704749\"><span class=\"h2\">Statistical methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The statistical techniques were developed as a means of sampling motor units over a wider stimulus range than other methods, theoretically providing a more complete representation of motor units of differing sizes and stimulus thresholds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Statistical MUNE methods are the most complex of MUNE methods, requiring proprietary software packages to control either nerve stimulation or data analysis.</p><p>In the Poisson statistical method with its subsequent modifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>], a stimulus-response curve is generated, somewhat analogous to the incremental compound motor action potential (CMAP) of the original incremental method (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70888\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70888 \">figure 3</a>). A stimulus intensity producing specific range of CMAP amplitudes is chosen, and the nerve is then stimulated repeatedly at that level, such that motor axons with activation thresholds near this stimulus level will fire in variable combinations with each stimulus. Because only a small number of axons will have similar activation thresholds, this variation produces slight variation in CMAP amplitude from stimulus to stimulus. This variation is sufficient to enable Poisson statistical analysis, providing an estimate of the size of the motor units at that stimulus level. The process is repeated at several different levels of stimulus intensity (from low to intermediate to high), providing different samples for use in deriving an average motor unit size.</p><p>A number of technical pitfalls affecting the Poisson statistical MUNE method have been identified, such that it is now rarely used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. As an example, certain diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are associated with motor unit instability, meaning that single motor units display excessive amplitude variability when undergoing repeated stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This instability is particularly problematic for the Poisson statistical method, which assumes that the probability of a given motor unit firing does not vary from stimulus to stimulus and that any response variability is due only to the number of motor units that respond in an intermittent manner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. As ALS progresses and only individual large motor units are firing, the Poisson calculation can no longer be applied.</p><p>The Bayesian statistical MUNE method attempted to account for some of the various unknown factors that complicate the calculation of MUNE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. These included uncertainties regarding motor unit numbers, firing thresholds, and sizes, as well as the variability between and within motor units. Each of these uncertainties is expressed as a probability. The Bayesian method uses standard motor nerve conduction techniques where 500 to 1000 stimuli are given from the threshold stimulus to the stimulus that evokes the maximal response. This generates a stimulus response curve, which is also called a CMAP scan (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70888\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70888 \">figure 3</a>). In the Bayesian analysis, the entire stimulus response curve is analyzed such that sampling of motor unit sizes is not required. The motor unit number is expressed as a probability that a certain number of motor units represents the true value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Unlike the Poisson statistical method, the Bayesian method makes no assumptions about the number, firing threshold, or size of motor units, and values for all of the unknown parameters are generated. The utility of this method is limited by the number of stimuli that need to be given and the processing power needed to perform the data analysis; one study currently takes many hours of computer time to be completed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H764551\"><span class=\"h2\">Motor unit number index (MUNIX)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The motor unit number index (MUNIX) method is a noninvasive way to estimate the number of motor units using the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) recorded by standard motor nerve conduction techniques and the electromyographic surface interference pattern (SIP) recorded during voluntary contraction at increasing force levels against resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. The CMAP and SIP area and power values are used to compute the &quot;ideal case motor unit count&quot; (ICMUC), which is then plotted against the SIP area (a measure of force). The SIP area at the arbitrary value of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mV/ms</span> is used to select the MUNIX value. The MUNIX method produces an index (without any units) related to the number of motor units but not the absolute value.</p><p>The motor unit size index (MUSIX) is calculated by dividing MUNIX into the CMAP amplitude. MUSIX is expressed in microvolts but is an index of motor unit size and not the absolute value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The reproducibility of the MUNIX method appears comparable to other methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>An advantage of MUNIX is that there is no need to obtain the average single motor unit action potential (SMUAP), a factor that can shorten the test procedure and reduce patient discomfort compared with most other MUNE methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. MUNIX is faster than other methods and does not require electrical stimulation. The fact that the index obtained has no direct relationship to the number of motor units actually present in a muscle is a limiting factor. However, the use of the MUNIX method has continued, particularly in Europe. MUNIX has been compared with the incremental method, with a normal MUNIX of approximately 150 to 200 obtained for the abductor digiti minimi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14704756\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison of major MUNE methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comparisons of MUNE methods are hindered by the lack of a clear gold standard (ie, no other clear methods exist to estimate motor unit numbers). Anatomic studies (ie, autopsy data), which attempt to count motor axons in cross sections of the peripheral nerve on the basis of axon diameter, are of questionable value because there is no established histologic marker for motor axons, and an assumption is required for the proportion of motor axons in a mixed nerve. Consequently, most of the limited numbers of anatomic studies have yielded higher motor unit counts than the physiologic methods, likely due to the inadvertent inclusion of large diameter sensory axons in the estimate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. In contrast, a few anatomic studies have shown motor unit counts similar to those estimated by statistical MUNE electrophysiologic methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Without a clear external gold standard, the accuracy of different MUNE methods cannot be definitively measured. Therefore, MUNE techniques used in assessing disease must be evaluated through comparisons with normative control data and by studies assessing validity and reproducibility in the context of mild and severe motor unit loss. The applicability of the MUNE method to different stages of disease is important; the method should be sensitive to unstable motor units that occur with active denervation in diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and to the presence of small or large motor unit counts.</p><p>Normative values have been reported for several MUNE techniques, particularly in the thenar musculature. Average thenar MUNE counts on young subjects utilizing the incremental and multiple point stimulation techniques are remarkably similar at 258 and 228 motor units, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/19,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,42</a>]. The close concordance of average MUNE values reported with these methods suggests that the theoretical limitations of these techniques do not critically alter the results of these tests. Statistical methods in general calculate smaller MUNE values; it is uncertain whether this represents an index or the true number of motor units.</p><p>Because absolute MUNE values vary from person to person, MUNE is most useful for tracking motor unit loss over time, using repeated studies in the same muscle of a given subject. Since the rate and degree of motor unit loss are especially important parameters in diseases which rapidly destroy motor neurons, such as ALS, it is critically important to ensure that the MUNE methods used in serial studies yield highly reproducible results. Methods with poor reproducibility cannot be used to reliably track changes over time. The multipoint incremental method appears highly reproducible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], and the computerized multiple point stimulation method has been tested by numerous investigators, demonstrating high reproducibility in normal subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/17,20,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20,43</a>] and in patients with ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/20,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,44</a>]. Reproducibility of the Poisson statistical method has also been assessed on normal subjects using a variety of modifications to the original method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/24,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26,27</a>], and there are limited data regarding reproducibility of the Bayesian statistical and MUNIX methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/31,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,33</a>].</p><p>A variety of diseases can injure or destroy the anterior horn cell <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> motor axon. When a motor axon dies, the muscle fibers it supplies are orphaned and are no longer activated, since central commands from the corticospinal pathway can no longer reach them. When a sufficient number of motor units are lost, clinical weakness and atrophy of the muscle appears. However, a compensatory mechanism known as collateral reinnervation can preserve or restore strength, despite substantial motor unit loss. In this process, surviving motor axons branch to reinnervate orphaned muscle fibers, bringing them back into service. Such motor units become larger by the adoption of these fibers, but at least two to three months is required for reinnervation to become established.</p><p>Appropriate interpretation of changes in the MUNE for a given muscle necessitates concurrent measures of reinnervation. Reinnervation can be estimated from the average single motor unit action potential (SMUAP) size, as motor units enlarge with reinnervation. The multiple point stimulation method yields the most detailed data regarding individual motor units by providing a group of SMUAP waveforms for analysis. However, changes in average SMUAP size can be tracked over time during MUNE studies using all of the above methods, providing a means of simultaneously following both MUNE and the extent and progression of reinnervation. </p><p>Finally, practical factors, such as comfort, duration of study, and technical difficulty are important in determining which MUNE method to employ. Methods that can be employed on multiple electromyography platforms are most likely to be employed in multicenter clinical trials. Those that require the least number of stimuli at the lowest intensity are the most likely to be well tolerated by patients. It is still a matter of debate as to which MUNE technique produces the most reliable data with the best generalizability and patient tolerability. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14704763\"><span class=\"h1\">MUNE IN AGING AND DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MUNE has been used to evaluate motor unit loss in normal aging and in a number of neuromuscular diseases, providing unique insights into normal senescence and the pathophysiology of illness. MUNE is one of the most sensitive measures of disease progression for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and has been used successfully as a surrogate marker of deterioration in ALS clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14704772\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal aging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early incremental MUNE studies revealed a dramatic decline in thenar MUNE with advancing age, with 50 percent or greater reductions in MUNE from age 20 to age 70 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>], while multiple point stimulation MUNE studies revealed an approximate 50 percent decline in MUNE between ages 30 and 70 years.

Symptomatically, such injury results in progressive quadriparesis and loss of speech, swallowing and respiratory function, with death occurring on average in three to five years after the onset of the first symptoms.

Other methods of assessing motor neurons, such as assessment of muscle strength, are confounded by the compensatory effect of collateral reinnervation, despite ongoing loss of motor units. Consequently, more MUNE studies have been performed in ALS than in any other disorder, substantially increasing our knowledge of the pathophysiology of motor neuron death in ALS. These studies have shown that disease progression in ALS is associated with both a considerable loss of motor units and a substantial compensatory increase in motor unit size, the latter a consequence of collateral reinnervation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an early study, incremental MUNE was applied to the intrinsic foot muscles of normal subjects and to patients with ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Compared with normal subjects, the number of motor units in patients with ALS was reduced by an average of 62 percent compared with controls, while individual motor unit action potential (MUAP) amplitudes were 145 percent higher. In another report, incremental MUNE was followed longitudinally in 74 ALS patients, demonstrating an average 50 percent loss of motor units for every six months of disease progression throughout the three year duration of the study (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50926\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50926 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In addition, the MUAPs showed progressive enlargement in most patients with ALS, consistent with collateral reinnervation and increased motor unit size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65950\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65950 \">figure 5</a>). Incremental MUNE studies have also been employed to calculate a linear estimate of rate of disease progression, and subsequent time to death or tracheostomy. One such study found that MUNE was a better predictor of survival time than measures of forced vital capacity or isometric muscle strength, while linear estimates of disease progression using MUNE correlated with time of survival from disease onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple point stimulation (MPS) MUNE studies in ALS have also revealed motor unit loss of &gt;80 percent below the normal range by the time the diagnosis is first made and increases in average MUAP size exceeding 600 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Because of this substantial compensatory increase in motor unit size, a consequence of collateral reinnervation, compound motor action potential (CMAP) amplitude remained within normal limits until the MUNE dropped to &lt;10 percent of normal, when clinical atrophy also began to appear. Longitudinal MPS MUNE was also superior to the Medical Research Council manual muscle testing score and to forced vital capacity measurements in demonstrating monthly rates of change in subjects with ALS, particularly those with slower progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Other studies using MPS MUNE have found statistically significant correlations with muscle strength and respiratory muscle function, and confirmed that MPS MUNE is a sensitive and reliable method for following the loss of lower motor neurons over time in patients with ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poisson statistical MUNE confirmed average 50 percent declines in MUNE for each six months of disease progression in ALS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], consistent with earlier studies. This figure has been remarkably consistent across MUNE methods and across studies since first reported in the early 1990s. In contrast, fiber density studies (another means of quantifying the extent of reinnervation) supported 40 to 50 percent increases in collateral reinnervation on average, while CMAP and grip strength did not change significantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. More rapid declines in MUNE correlated with shorter survival, while greater increases in fiber density correlated with longer survival, supporting a more aggressive degree of reinnervation in those patients with a slower clinical decline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In eight ALS centers, 71 subjects with ALS were followed with repeated multipoint incremental MUNE studies for up to one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Test-retest reliability was higher than any other previously used method, and MUNE declined by approximately 9 percent per month. The behavior of this measure compared favorably with many other physiologic and nonphysiologic outcome measures commonly employed in ALS studies.</p><p/><p>MUNE studies are unique in their ability to gauge the effectiveness of experimental therapies in both preventing motor neuron loss (by tracking MUNE over time) and supporting collateral reinnervation (by tracking single MUAP size over time) in living patients with ALS. Consequently MUNE is useful as a measure of disease progression for ALS and has been used successfully as a surrogate marker of deterioration in ALS clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/45,57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,57,58</a>]. Early stratification of patients according to rate of progression and projected survival is another potential advantage of MUNE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/52,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,59,60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14704786\"><span class=\"h3\">MUNE in animal models of ALS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MUNE has proven to be valuable in studies of transgenic animal models of ALS as a marker of early disease progression and response to treatment. Transgenic mice with point mutations in the gene encoding <span class=\"nowrap\">Cu/Zn</span> superoxide dismutase (a mutation responsible for some forms of familial ALS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>] develop a syndrome resembling human ALS. Incremental MUNE in these animals detects motor neuron loss beginning well before clinical signs appear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>], a process that continues throughout the course of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. A single MUNE evaluation performed close to the onset of behavioral abnormalities predicts disease onset, while the change in MUNE with serial evaluation predicts survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. MUNE has been used to distinguish between motor neuron disease associated with overexpression of the mutant gene, and that associated with complete absence of the gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/62,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,65</a>]. These studies demonstrate MUNE can provide insight into the pathophysiology of novel genetic abnormalities in transgenic models of human disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14704793\"><span class=\"h2\">MUNE in other neuromuscular diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to its utility in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, MUNE may be useful in other diseases affecting lower motor neurons such as poliomyelitis, spinal muscular atrophy, and spinobulbar muscular atrophy (Kennedy syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/66-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-69</a>]. For example, MUNE has been used in an open label study of valproic acid in spinal muscular atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polio and infectious diseases of the anterior horn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-polio-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-polio syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-muscular-atrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal muscular atrophy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>MUNE has also been studied in a variety of diseases that cause damage to the motor nerves. These diseases, primarily the axonal neuropathies, result in motor unit loss and collateral reinnervation. A study of secondary axonal involvement in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1a) showed little age-dependent difference in the loss of motor units between patients and normal controls, suggesting that the loss of motor units in adult CMT1A is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. MUNE is reduced in both diabetic and uremic neuropathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/15,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,72</a>], as well as in alcoholic neuropathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. The predominately demyelinating neuropathies have been less intensively studied. Dramatic early reductions in MUNE were demonstrated in acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-unit-number-estimation-mune/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>], most likely due to high degrees of conduction block secondary to demyelination, causing functional loss of motor units. However, &quot;axonal&quot; AIDP with early acute axon loss also may account for some of these cases.

Thus, to calculate the MUNE, a waveform or value representing the average single motor unit size within that nerve is needed in addition to the CMAP.
