These enzymatic defects may involve carbohydrate, amino acid, or fat metabolism and are individually rare; almost all are inherited as autosomal recessive traits. Because of the interactions of fat, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism in the maintenance of normal fuel homeostasis, abnormalities in the metabolism of a single substrate can have primary and secondary effects on other metabolic pathways. A common expression of these derangements is the development of biochemical or symptomatic hypoglycemia. If hypoglycemia is not promptly recognized in children, they may develop symptoms and suffer permanent neurologic sequelae.</p><p>The etiology of hypoglycemia in infants and children will be presented here. The approach to hypoglycemia in infants and children and to hypoglycemia in neonates is discussed separately.

This can be due to defective glucose production, increased glucose utilization, or some combination of the two. In many cases of hypoglycemia, a clear pathophysiologic mechanism cannot be assigned. However, we would encourage the reader to envision mechanisms that would lead to an imbalance in the rate of glucose production <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> glucose utilization based on known physiologic principles that we believe are fundamental to glucose homeostasis in infants, children, and young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DISORDERS OF CARBOHYDRATE METABOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disorders of carbohydrate metabolism that can lead to hypoglycemia include deficiencies of hepatic enzymes in the pathways of the metabolism of glycogen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51949\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51949 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71999\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71999 \">table 3</a>), galactose, and fructose.</p><p>The time of onset of hypoglycemia in relation to the last meal may provide a clue to the diagnosis.

Hepatomegaly is absent. Hypoglycemia in neonates may be severe. Morning fatigue, relieved by eating, may be the presenting symptom in older children.

There are two subtypes of GSD type I: Ia and Ib. Type Ia (von Gierke disease, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/232200&amp;token=ODIqmPyH03K5IrNHL4ootvp3ssM86wOnxIOFqyKtC9OG0f9chwuj/8li5/4Tuw3o&amp;TOPIC_ID=5801\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MIM #232200</a>) accounts for 80 percent of cases and is caused by deficiency in glucose 6-phosphate hydrolase activity.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucose-6-phosphatase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-i-von-gierke-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency (glycogen storage disease I, von Gierke disease)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency usually results in severe hypoglycemia after a brief fast or in the usual interval between meals. It is associated with marked lactic acidosis (from the metabolism of glucose-6-phosphate) and mild to moderate ketosis. Additional clinical features include hepatomegaly, growth retardation, delayed puberty, hyperuricemia, platelet dysfunction, and hyperlipidemia (particularly hypertriglyceridemia, which can lead to xanthoma formation and pancreatitis). Glycogen accumulation in the kidney causes nephromegaly, and inadequately treated patients may develop progressive renal disease, proteinuria, and hypertension due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucose-6-phosphatase-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-i-von-gierke-disease#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency (glycogen storage disease I, von Gierke disease)&quot;, section on 'Renal'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-classification-and-pathogenesis-of-focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, classification, and pathogenesis of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with GSD type Ib present with identical clinical and biochemical findings, but also have chronic or intermittent neutropenia and neutrophil dysfunction, and are susceptible to recurrent infections.

The first step in confirming the diagnosis is DNA testing for common mutations. If none is identified, one should consider next-generation DNA sequencing techniques (eg, whole exome sequencing), and if no explanatory defect is identified a liver biopsy should be considered.</p><p>The goal of treatment is the maintenance of normal plasma glucose concentrations. Other biochemical parameters, such as lactic acidemia and hypertriglyceridemia, frequently improve in parallel with improved glucose control. Glucose concentrations are maintained with frequent administration of uncooked cornstarch (UCS) or continuous glucose infusion (particularly at night) via a feeding gastrostomy. A high-protein diet is <strong>not</strong> useful in patients with GSD I because glucose-6-phosphate also is required in the final step of gluconeogenesis. The treatment of GSD I is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Fatty acid oxidation disorders include carnitine deficiency, fatty acid transportation defects, and defects of beta-oxidation enzymes. These disorders are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of fatty acid oxidation disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific fatty acid oxidation disorders&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pathophysiology</strong> &ndash; Normally, during periods of fasting or intercurrent illness, free fatty acids (FFA) are mobilized from adipose tissue to be used directly for energy by various body tissues (eg, heart, skeletal muscle, gut, and skin). FFA undergo beta-oxidation in the liver, which produces ketone bodies (acetoacetic acid and beta-hydroxybutyric acid) that can be used as an alternate energy source for the brain. In infants and young children, mobilization of FFA usually begins when the plasma glucose decreases to &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and insulin secretion is suppressed, usually after approximately 12 hours of fasting. In older children, significantly increased mobilization of FFA and generation of ketone bodies typically occurs after 16 to 24 hours of fasting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The generation of ketone bodies by the liver (which is the only organ with the enzymatic capacity to generate acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate) involves mobilization of FFA, activation of fatty acids by acyl-CoA synthetase, transport into the hepatic mitochondrial matrix, and mitochondrial beta-oxidation of the fatty acids and transport of the ketone bodies into the circulation. Enzymes used in this pathway and the known defects in their activities are depicted in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F114663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114663 \">table 4</a>). Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is the most common defect, occurring in 1:10,000 births in a Caucasian population of northern European origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Fatty acid oxidation defects are implicated in a small proportion of cases of sudden infant death syndrome.

The hypoglycemia may be caused by decreased hepatic glucose production, because gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis are intimately linked to the production and utilization of phosphopyridine nucleotides. Alternatively or in addition, the hypoglycemia may be caused by accelerated rates of glucose utilization, because glucose may function as the primary substrate for all tissues in the absence of ketone body availability and defective FFA oxidation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Newborn screening</strong> &ndash; In many developed countries, most fatty acid oxidation disorders are detected through newborn screening, but the specific disorders tested vary among countries. For infants with a positive newborn screen, the preferred tests to confirm the diagnosis of fatty acid oxidation disorder are a plasma acylcarnitine profile and total and free carnitine levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-fatty-acid-oxidation-disorders#H3618243062\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of fatty acid oxidation disorders&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical features</strong> &ndash; Fatty acid oxidation disorders can present at any age, depending on the severity of the defect. The most common form (Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency; MCADD) usually presents in early childhood. The most severe forms, such as the long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders, typically present in the first few days of life. The symptoms usually are induced by prolonged fasting or exercise, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Symptomatic hypoglycemia is typically the first manifestation and usually occurs during an illness in which anorexia or vomiting prevent oral intake for up to 12 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, symptoms may occur after only a brief fast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Episodes of hypoglycemia may be profound (plasma glucose concentration &lt;15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [&le;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> and accompanied by relatively low plasma ketone concentrations, elevated concentrations of free fatty acids, abnormalities in the acylcarnitine profile (often with low plasma carnitine), and sometimes hyperammonemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F114663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114663 \">table 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to hypoglycemia, children with fatty acid oxidation disorders may have severe disturbance of consciousness that does not improve with normalization of plasma glucose. Additional clinical features include hypotonia, hepatomegaly with microvesicular fat accumulation, elevated plasma activities of both liver and muscle enzymes, heart failure, rhabdomyolysis, retinal degeneration, and frequently, cerebral edema.

Neither defects in hepatic gluconeogenesis, nor functional disturbances of insulin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glucagon</a>, or cortisol have been identified. When hypoglycemia occurs, glycogenolysis is stimulated by epinephrine and glucagon. However, glycogen stores can only sustain glycogenolysis for a limited time, after which gluconeogenesis, stimulated by growth hormone (GH) and cortisol ensues. Substrate for gluconeogenesis (alanine, lactate, glycerol) is derived from skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Ketotic hypoglycemia was thought to be caused by decreased availability or impaired mobilization of muscle amino acids and other substrates in children. However, since amino acids contribute little to gluconeogenesis, except in the acidotic condition, there is little direct proof of &quot;substrate limited hypoglycemia.&quot;</p><p>The most likely cause is an imbalance in the suppression of glucose utilization by ketone bodies and a limited rate of hepatic glucose production. This could be caused by rapid depletion of the hepatic glycogen stores, resulting in a decrease in glucose production before the plasma ketone bodies and FFA have reached a concentration to cause an equivalent decrease in glucose utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Alternatively, there may be a failure to appropriately increase renal gluconeogenesis. This proposed functional mechanism is supported by the spontaneous remission of the disorder at a time when the brain to body weight is decreasing, and endogenous substrate availability is increasing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-hypoglycemia-in-infants-and-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to hypoglycemia in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Glucose homeostasis in normal infants and children'</a>.)</p><p>A diagnosis of ketotic hypoglycemia requires exclusion of other causes of hypoglycemia, particularly GH deficiency, hypopituitarism, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) unresponsiveness, and glycogen synthase deficiency, all of which may have similar presentations.
