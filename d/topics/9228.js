The glycated hemoglobin (A1C) value falls to 9.30 percent, and symptomatic insulin reactions become less frequent. However, glucose control remains unsatisfactory based on the A1C level and on continuing lability of blood glucose values, predominantly before supper, when values fluctuate between 41 and 331 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.3 to 18.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p>What do you do now?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Change the patient's NPH insulin doses to a single dose of glargine insulin 14 units <strong>at bedtime</strong> and continue the aspart insulin as before to provide a more stable basal insulin level.
