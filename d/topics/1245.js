The nature of the reaction may not be immediately apparent, because many reactions begin with nonspecific symptoms such as fever or chills. In addition, patients receiving transfusions often have complex underlying clinical conditions, the symptoms of which may mimic a transfusion reaction. Thus, a patient experiencing symptoms or signs consistent with an acute transfusion reaction must be evaluated promptly, with input from the transfusion service, and treated as expeditiously as possible to minimize the impact of the reaction.</p><p>This topic describes our approach to determining the cause of a suspected acute reaction to transfusion of red blood cells, platelets, or plasma. </p><p>Specific acute transfusion reactions and details of their management are discussed more extensively in separate topic reviews.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volume overload &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute lung injury &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Febrile nonhemolytic reactions &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunologic-transfusion-reactions#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunologic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Febrile nonhemolytic reactions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sepsis &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urticaria &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunologic-transfusion-reactions#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunologic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Urticarial (allergic) reactions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anaphylaxis &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunologic-transfusion-reactions#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunologic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Anaphylactic transfusion reactions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute hemolysis &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemolytic-transfusion-reactions#H354742\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemolytic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Acute hemolytic reactions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Air embolism &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=air-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Air embolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Delayed transfusion reactions, which may occur in the days to weeks following a transfusion, are also discussed in detail separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed hemolysis &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemolytic-transfusion-reactions#H354791\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemolytic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Delayed hemolytic reactions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombocytopenia &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunologic-transfusion-reactions#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunologic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Post-transfusion purpura'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Graft-versus-host disease &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Reactions to other plasma-derived products, such as intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG), are presented separately.

Presenting symptoms include fever, chills, flank pain, and oozing from intravenous sites. Immediate communication with the transfusion service is critical to allow for appropriate record checking, which may prevent administration of a wrongly labeled unit to another patient. Treatment involves aggressive hydration and diuresis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemolytic-transfusion-reactions#H354742\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemolytic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Acute hemolytic reactions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6713972\"><span class=\"h2\">Anaphylactic transfusion reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any allergic reaction other than hives constitutes an anaphylactic transfusion reaction. This includes angioedema, wheezing, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypotension. Anaphylactic reactions may occur in IgA-deficient individuals who produce anti-IgA antibodies that react with IgA in the transfused product, or patients who have allergies to another constituent in the transfused product. Management may include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>, antihistamines, and vasopressors, depending on the degree of allergic symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunologic-transfusion-reactions#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunologic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Anaphylactic transfusion reactions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6713978\"><span class=\"h2\">Febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FNHTRs are common; these reactions are characterized by fever, usually accompanied by chills, in the absence of other systemic symptoms. Because the development of other symptoms is not known at the time of the initial fever, FNHTR is a diagnosis of exclusion; the possibility of other febrile transfusion reactions must be eliminated, including AHTR, sepsis, and TRALI. The most common cause of FNHTR is release of cytokines from white blood cells (WBCs) in a product that has not been leukoreduced. In the case of platelet transfusion, a similar reaction characterized by chills <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rigors can occur in the absence of a temperature change. Management is symptomatic. High quality evidence to support the prophylactic use of premedication with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> or antihistamines is lacking; this subject is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunologic-transfusion-reactions#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunologic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Febrile nonhemolytic reactions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3542146459\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary hypotensive reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary hypotensive transfusion reactions are rare transfusion reactions in which there is a drop in blood pressure without other causes of hypotension. Blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, or both) decreases by 30 mmHg or more within minutes of onset of transfusion and returns to baseline once the transfusion is stopped. Other types of transfusion reactions associated with hypotension (eg, acute hemolytic reaction, transfusion-related acute lung injury [TRALI], sepsis, anaphylaxis) must be excluded before a diagnosis of primary hypotensive reaction is made. </p><p>Primary hypotensive reactions have been reported most commonly with platelet transfusion; they have also occurred during apheresis procedures. Predisposing factors include use of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor by the recipient, or filtration through a negatively charged leukocyte reduction filter (which are no longer commonly used) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-acute-transfusion-reaction/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The mechanism is thought to involve vasoactive kinins (eg, bradykinin). The reactions are rapidly reversible and generally do not require specific treatment or prevention, except for possible avoidance of ACE inhibitors prior to planned transfusion or apheresis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6713991\"><span class=\"h2\">Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TACO is a form of pulmonary edema due to volume excess or circulatory overload; it typically occurs in patients who receive a large volume of a transfused product over a short period of time, or in those with underlying cardiovascular disease. Management includes diuresis and supplementary oxygen; ventilatory support may rarely be required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6714054\"><span class=\"h2\">Transfusion-associated sepsis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transfusion-associated sepsis (or bacterial infection) is caused by transfusion of a product that contains a microorganism. Initial findings may include fever, chills, and hypotension. Unlike sepsis from an underlying localized infection, transfusion-associated sepsis may involve a large intravenous inoculum, which in the case of gram negative organisms could include an infusion of endotoxin. Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics and hemodynamic support. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6714004\"><span class=\"h2\">Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TRALI is a life-threatening form of acute lung injury that occurs when recipient neutrophils are activated by the transfused product in an appropriately primed pulmonary vasculature. Presenting findings include fever, chills, and respiratory distress. Therapy is largely supportive and may include intubation and mechanical ventilation. A subsequent evaluation is directed at identifying an implicated donor so that individual does not continue to donate. The patient can receive blood products from other donors without restrictions, but should not receive any remaining untransfused portion of the implicated product or any other products from the implicated donor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6714019\"><span class=\"h2\">Urticarial transfusion reaction (UTR)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urticarial reactions are associated with hives but no other allergic findings (ie, no wheezing, angioedema, hypotension). The most common cause is an antigen-antibody interaction that occurs between patient and the product; commonly implicated antigens include a number of donor serum proteins. UTR is not a contraindication to continuing the transfusion as long as it is clear there are no other allergic symptoms. Antihistamines can be given, but are not indicated prophylactically.

As an example, a review of reactions to over 100,000 transfusions at a single institution found that children had a greater frequency of reactions than adults (0.6 versus 0.2 percent), especially allergic reactions (0.3 versus 0.1 percent) and FNHTRs (0.2 versus 0.05 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-acute-transfusion-reaction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Ratios of the types of components transfused were similar in children and adults.</p><p>The severity of ATRs also varies, although the discomfort of the patient may not always parallel the risk of adverse outcomes. Potentially fatal acute reactions include TRALI, TACO, AHTR, sepsis, and anaphylaxis (see <a href=\"#H3438146981\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> below). Relatively benign reactions include urticaria, hypothermia, hypocalcemia, non-immune hemolysis, and FNHTR. Importantly, early signs and symptoms of an ATR may not distinguish between benign and more serious transfusion reactions; thus, all ATRs must be considered potentially serious and evaluated accordingly until demonstrated to be otherwise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3438146981\"><span class=\"h1\">MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mortality from acute transfusion reactions is a rare event, with rates estimated at approximately 0.6 per million (commonly cited as 1 in 1.8 million) to 2.3 per million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-acute-transfusion-reaction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These data come from various surveillance systems that may not be directly comparable, and mortality rates may differ depending on the patient population and local transfusion practices. </p><p>The reactions associated with the greatest number of deaths in the late 1990s and early 2000s were TRALI and AHTR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-acute-transfusion-reaction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Practices implemented since that time including limiting the use of Fresh Frozen Plasma to male donors and bacterial detection of apheresis platelets may have reduced the overall mortality rates and altered the relative contributions of different types of reactions.</p><p>The acute transfusion reactions most likely to be fatal, in decreasing order of lethality, include TRALI, TACO, AHTR, sepsis, and anaphylaxis. Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (ta-GVHD) is almost uniformly fatal; this presents as a delayed (rather than acute) reaction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5406721\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO SUSPECT AN ACUTE TRANSFUSION REACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential of an acute transfusion reaction (ATR) should be considered in any patient who develops adverse signs and symptoms during or within 24 hours after completion of a transfusion. Many of the most severe reactions occur within the first 15 minutes of transfusion.</p><p>The most common signs and symptoms are fever (a 1&deg;C rise in temperature above baseline), chills, pruritus, and urticaria. Often these resolve promptly without specific treatment or complications. Other findings that may be an indication of a more severe, potentially fatal reaction include respiratory distress, hemoglobinuria, loss of consciousness, hypertension, hypotension, flank or back pain, jaundice, abnormal bleeding, or <span class=\"nowrap\">oliguria/anuria</span>. Disseminated bleeding or oozing from intravenous sites may be the only indication that an anesthetized patient is experiencing an ATR.</p><p>The possibility of an ATR should be considered in any patient receiving a transfusion who develops any of these symptoms, or in patients developing mental status changes, including feelings of anxiety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dread. </p><p>The possibility of a transfusion reaction in an anesthetized patient receiving a transfusion should be considered if the patient develops fever, hypotension, wheezing, hypoxia, <span class=\"nowrap\">hives/angioedema,</span> hemoglobinuria, <span class=\"nowrap\">oliguria/anuria,</span> or disseminated bleeding, including oozing from intravenous sites.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11614097\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (ALL PATIENTS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following steps should be taken without delay in a patient with a suspected ATR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F96323\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96323 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediately <strong>stop the transfusion</strong>; save the remaining bag and tubing for potential analysis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain a <strong>patent intravenous</strong> line with normal saline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Confirm the correct product</strong> was transfused to the intended patient based on product labeling and patient identification; also assess the product for gross color changes or bubbles suggestive of bacterial contamination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assess the patient</strong>, including symptoms of fever, respiratory distress, chest pain, back pain, itching, angioedema; measure vital signs; perform a limited physical examination guided by symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Contact the transfusion service</strong> to discuss the appropriate evaluation and initial management. </p><p/><p>If the clerical check reveals that the patient received a product intended for a different patient, the transfusion service must be notified urgently because another patient may also be at risk of receiving an incorrect product.</p><p>The transfusion service may request return of the remaining (untransfused) component, associated intravenous bags and tubing, and blood and urine testing. (See <a href=\"#H6714340\" class=\"local\">'Initial laboratory testing'</a> below.)</p><p>Additional transfusion of the remaining product or another product is usually deferred until a preliminary evaluation has been conducted. If the symptoms subside and the correct product is confirmed, a decision regarding administration of further transfusions must be reached with input from both the treating physician and transfusion service.</p><p>Reactions in which transfusion of the same product may be possible include urticaria without other allergic symptoms, fever due to an underlying illness rather than the transfusion, and transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) that has resolved with diuresis or other measures. Transfusion of the original product should <strong>not</strong> be continued in cases of suspected acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR), anaphylaxis, sepsis, or transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). </p><p>Decisions regarding the need for additional transfusions of products other than the one associated with the reaction depend on the original indication for the transfusion. As an example, a patient who has already received the majority of the transfusion for a less severe anemia or thrombocytopenia without bleeding may not require additional transfusions; whereas a patient with severe bleeding and thrombocytopenia with suspected transfusional volume overload who is responding to diuresis may benefit from additional transfusions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3609443\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL PATIENT ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial patient assessment and relevant aspects of the clinical history are used to determine the most likely reaction(s). Subsequent laboratory testing and response to management interventions is used to confirm or refute the suspected diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3609493\"><span class=\"h2\">Fever/chills</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fever (ie, increase in temperature of &gt;1&deg;C), with or without a chill, is a critical sign of an ATR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F96323\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96323 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F94399\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94399 \">table 1</a>). <span class=\"nowrap\">Fever/chills</span> suggest an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR), a septic transfusion reaction, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), or a febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR). AHTR, sepsis, and TRALI are potentially fatal; FNHTR is less serious but is for the most part a diagnosis of exclusion; FNHTR is diagnosed when the more consequential etiologies of fever have been excluded by clinical and laboratory investigation.</p><p>Fever may also be a component of the patient's underlying illness. In such cases, consultation between the primary clinician and the transfusion service regarding the likelihood of an ATR is warranted.</p><p>Significant ATRs <strong>not</strong> accompanied by fever include: urticaria, anaphylaxis, primary hypotensive reactions caused by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO). Non-immune hemolysis, air embolus, hypocalcemia, and hypothermia also generally are not associated with fever or chills.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR) often presents with fever as the first sign of the reaction; therefore, hemolysis must be excluded by a clerical check that the transfused product was appropriate for the patient, and by laboratory evaluation for hemolysis; this evaluation may need to occur simultaneously with consideration of other potential transfusion reactions also associated with fever (eg, TRALI, sepsis). (See <a href=\"#H6714480\" class=\"local\">'Moderate to severe reactions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sepsis from a transfused product often presents initially with fever; transfusion-associated sepsis occurs most commonly with platelet transfusion but can also be associated with RBCs or plasma. The transfused product must be inspected for signs of bacterial contamination including cloudiness, and microbiological testing is used to detect if an organism is present and, if so, to identify it. (See <a href=\"#H6714621\" class=\"local\">'Suspected septic reaction'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TRALI is often associated with fever, accompanied by respiratory distress and a new infiltrate on chest radiography. Patients with fever who also have respiratory symptoms should be evaluated for TRALI. (See <a href=\"#H3609500\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory distress'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6714408\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory distress: TACO versus TRALI'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FNHTR is characterized by fever without evidence of other acute transfusion reaction; fever with a chill is often a hallmark of a FNHTR; however, this is a diagnosis of exclusion, and often other evaluations are indicated before fever is attributed to FNHTR. (See <a href=\"#H5406612\" class=\"local\">'Isolated fever/chills'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Patients with a feeling of warmth or chills <strong>without</strong> a &gt;1&deg;C increase in temperature should be observed for 15 to 30 minutes while the intravenous line is kept open with normal saline. If symptoms subside, transfusion may be restarted slowly.</p><p>Hypothermia is occasionally seen in recipients of large volumes of refrigerated blood products. Patients with hypothermia may feel cold but generally do not have shaking chills. Temperature measurements will not show fever. Warming the patient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the blood product is the only intervention needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3609500\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory distress</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory symptomatology characterizes TACO, TRALI, and anaphylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F96323\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef96323 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F94399\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94399 \">table 1</a>).

Anaphylaxis may also be associated with hypotension.</p><p>Respiratory distress can also be seen with an air infusion in the patient's intravenous line, an exceedingly rare occurrence.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=air-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Air embolism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-complications#H546467\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic apheresis (plasma exchange or cytapheresis): Complications&quot;, section on 'Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-related complications'</a>.)</p><p>ACE inhibitor reactions are rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-acute-transfusion-reaction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The mechanism(s), although incompletely understood, may involve concomitant ACE inhibition in combination with increased bradykinin levels in the transfused product (see <a href=\"#H3542146459\" class=\"local\">'Primary hypotensive reactions'</a> above). This has occurred more frequently with certain brands of leukoreduction filters, which are no longer commonly used. Recurrent hypotension with subsequent transfusions is not likely because products from different donors may not have high kinin levels. However, there is a theoretical possibility that withholding the ACE inhibitor for 24 hours prior to transfusion might decrease this risk. This intervention must be weighed against the benefits of ACE inhibition for the individual patient, and the certainty that all other possible explanations for hypotension have been eliminated (eg, atypical allergic transfusion reaction, reduced intravascular volume). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6714340\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to order laboratory testing should be made in discussion between the treating physician, who knows the patient's underlying illness, and transfusion service personnel, who know additional details of the transfused product and the appropriate testing needed.

Causes may include thermal injury to the cells from inappropriate warming or from rapid thawing of frozen products. This condition is less severe than AHTR because the amount of free hemoglobin is limited, and hemolysis is not ongoing; however, if large amounts of free hemoglobin are transfused, symptoms can be significant. Typical findings include pink serum, pink urine, negative DAT, negative IAT, and a compatible crossmatch. Analysis of the remaining (untransfused) product will also reveal a pink supernatant after centrifugation. In this setting, brisk diuresis induced by infusion of 500 mL normal saline per hour or as tolerated is usually adequate.

In severe cases, 0.5 mL of a 1:10,000 aqueous solution may be administered intravenously. Antihistamines are also administered. Other therapies, such as inhaled bronchodilators, may be appropriate in some patients. In addition to managing the reaction, the response to these interventions further supports the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Laboratory testing for an anaphylactic reaction should include quantitative immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels as well as the presence of antibodies to immunoglobulin A (anti-IgA). This testing is not indicated in patients with isolated urticaria.

In such cases, Gram stain should be performed on the returned component, and cultures should be performed on both the remaining component and a post-transfusion blood sample from the patient. A complete blood count (CBC) with white blood cell count (WBC) is also obtained.</p><p>Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy should be administered based on the severity of clinical symptoms or obvious abnormal appearance of the transfused product. Antibiotics may be adjusted based on the results of the gram stain or culture of the product, but should not be withheld while awaiting these results. An infectious disease clinician may be consulted for advice on appropriate antibiotic therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6714408\"><span class=\"h3\">Respiratory distress: TACO versus TRALI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A patient with respiratory distress may be suspected of having transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) or transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F86939\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86939 \">table 2</a>). In some cases the distinction between these reactions is relatively obvious; in others it may be more difficult, or TACO and TRALI may both occur. (See <a href=\"#H3609500\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory distress'</a> above.)</p><p>The initial evaluation includes chest radiography and assessment of oxygenation status using pulse oximetry or arterial blood gas measurement. Patients with hypoxia should receive supplemental oxygen regardless of the underlying cause. Severe respiratory compromise may require transfer to an intensive care unit for possible intubation and mechanical ventilation. A cardiologist or pulmonologist may be consulted for cardiovascular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ventilatory management.</p><p>TACO is more likely in patients who have received a large volume of fluid over a short period of time, elderly individuals, very young individuals, or those with underlying cardiac disease. TACO is also supported by findings of hypertension, heart failure, or elevated pulmonary artery wedge pressure. Hypoxemia and pulmonary edema on chest radiography may be seen with TACO. If the clinical evaluation suggests TACO, the patient should be positioned in a seated posture and diuresis should be initiated, and the patient's response may be helpful in confirming the initial assessment. Patients with apparent TACO who do not respond to diuresis can also be treated with phlebotomy. Laboratory testing for TACO may include an NT-Pro BNP measurement, which is supportive of TACO if elevated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-components-of-therapy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: Components of therapy&quot;, section on 'Initial therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco#H918286530\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>TRALI is more likely in patients who have respiratory distress out of proportion to the volume of fluid received or early on during the transfusion. Other findings in TRALI include respiratory distress of sudden onset; fever; hypotension; and pink frothy airway secretions. Unlike TACO, a diagnosis of TRALI requires hypoxemia and an abnormal chest radiograph. Individuals with underlying acute lung injury or an alternative risk factor for acute lung injury are referred to as having &quot;possible TRALI.&quot; Patients with suspected TRALI should have samples sent for HLA typing and possible testing for HLA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neutrophil antibodies, in consultation with the transfusion service. The blood collection facility should be informed of a suspected TRALI case so that appropriate specimens may be obtained from the donor (or donors) involved; this notification is done by the transfusion service. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Analysis of the pulmonary edema fluid may also be helpful in distinguishing TACO from TRALI in rare cases. The pulmonary edema in TACO is cardiogenic; thus, the fluid in the alveoli is a transudate. The pulmonary edema in TRALI is non-cardiogenic; the fluid in the alveoli is an exudate.</p><p>Importantly, if TACO <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> TRALI do not appear to explain the clinical picture, assessment for other causes of respiratory distress should be pursued, including transfusion reactions such as sepsis and other coincident medical conditions such as pulmonary embolism or myocardial ischemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82700\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82700 \">table 3</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5406606\"><span class=\"h2\">Stable patient, mild reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The challenge when the patient appears to be having a mild reaction is that the ultimate course of the reaction is initially unknown.
