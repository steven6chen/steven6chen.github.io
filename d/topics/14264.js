Medical therapy (and metabolic evaluation) is usually undertaken in individuals who have formed more than one stone. Even if a patient has only passed one stone, it is important to review the imaging studies to determine if other stones are present in the kidney since stone passage does not equal stone formation. At a minimum, those with a single kidney stone are encouraged to increase their fluid intake and should consider undergoing a metabolic evaluation and periodic monitoring (usually by renal ultrasonography) for evidence of new stone formation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F57549\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57549 \">image 1</a>).

The management of patients with other types of stones including those of unknown composition, and risk factors for recurrent calcium stones are discussed separately.

Thus, the 24-hour collections should be performed before dietary modification is attempted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>From the viewpoint of diet, increasing the intake of fluid, dietary calcium, potassium and phytate may be beneficial. In addition, decreasing the intake of oxalate, animal protein, sucrose, fructose, sodium, supplemental <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a>, and supplemental calcium (as opposed to dietary calcium) may reduce the risk of stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for calcium stones in adults&quot;</a>). The role of vitamin D intake in stone formation remains unclear.</p><p>The importance of a possible &quot;stone clinic&quot; effect following dietary recommendations should not be underestimated. One study found that 58 percent of 108 patients evaluated for kidney stones had, over a five-year period, no evidence of active stone disease after a visit to the stone clinic in which minimal advice was given regarding diet and fluid intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Those patients who did not form new stones showed an increase in urine volume at follow-up versus no change in those who continued to form stones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Increase fluid intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasing fluid intake, spread throughout the day (although it is not essential that the patient wake up several times per night to urinate), will increase the urine flow rate and lower the urine solute concentration, both of which protect against stone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In one prospective trial, 199 patients with a first calcium oxalate stone were randomly assigned to no therapy or recommendation of a high fluid intake to produce at least 2 liters of urine per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. At five years, the incidence of new stone formation was significantly lower in the treated patients than in those in the control group (12 versus 27 percent). </p><p>Similar findings were noted in a prospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Stone formers who remained free of stones were noted to have a greater increase in urine volume than those who had recurrent disease (320 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day</span> versus no change). This study emphasizes that even small increases in fluid intake can reduce the risk of new stone formation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H471028491\"><span class=\"h3\">Type of fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of stone formation might be affected by the type of beverage consumed. However, only observational data are principally available and presented in more detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for calcium stones in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Coffee, tea, and alcohol have been reported in prospective observational studies to be associated with a lower risk of stones. Thus, there is no evidence that these beverages should be avoided to prevent stone formation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cranberry juice, advocated as prophylaxis against recurrent urinary tract infections, increased the urinary saturation of calcium oxalate when ingested in large amounts (one liter per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Ingestion of moderate amounts is unlikely to be harmful, and there is no evidence that this beverage is beneficial for stone prevention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Results from one randomized trial suggest that reducing soft drink consumption may reduce the risk of stone recurrence, although it is unclear what fluid replaced the soft drink [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Observational data also suggest that sugar-sweetened beverages are associated with a higher risk of stone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. We suggest that patients avoid calorie-containing beverages, such as sweetened soda, to avoid weight gain with the general increase in fluid intake. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Reduce animal protein intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adverse changes in urinary calcium and citrate excretion can be induced by a high-protein diet since the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids increases the daily acid load by generating sulfuric acid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56597\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56597 \">figure 1</a>). Animal protein is much more likely to induce this effect than vegetable protein since it has a higher sulfur content and therefore generates more acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. How acid loading produces these changes is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for calcium stones in adults&quot;, section on 'Protein'</a>.)</p><p>Thus, lowering animal protein intake will produce favorable changes in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, it has not been proven that this will reduce the incidence of stone formation. In one randomized trial, for example, reduced animal protein in association with higher dietary calcium and lower dietary sodium reduced the risk of stone recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], but the individual impact of animal protein could not be determined. A subsequent randomized trial found that, compared with a high fluid intake plus a diet rich in calcium, a low animal protein intake does not reduce stone recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, observational studies have been inconsistent, suggesting that a high-animal protein diet was a risk factor for renal stones in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], but not in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Based upon the available data, it would be prudent to avoid excessive animal protein intake for all calcium stone formers. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Increase fruit and vegetable intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Foods that are rich in potassium, particularly fruits and vegetables, may be beneficial. Increasing intake of fruits and vegetables, regardless of 24-hour urine values, may reduce the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation, particularly in patients who self-select a diet that is low in fruits and vegetables. This benefit is primarily the result of increasing citrate excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Limit dietary oxalate intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some foods contain very large amounts of oxalate and those should be avoided (eg, spinach, rhubarb, potatoes). In addition, some nuts and legumes are also high in oxalate and the intake should be limited (eg, peanuts, cashews, and almonds). The oxalate content of foods is available at the following website: <a href=\"http://regepi.bwh.harvard.edu/health/nutrition.html&amp;token=8l9XGPU3xIgBIb9kYZuyZT/ZpeGQ23/xYce7e1k600912lu2OphirsULbb2Ia37UzWqsc5hdIaRTTNoNyWEk7w==&amp;TOPIC_ID=7373\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">regepi.bwh.harvard.edu/health/nutrition.html</a>.</p><p>However, there is scant evidence that low-oxalate diets reduce the risk of stone formation. In prospective observational studies of individuals who had never had a stone, higher dietary oxalate only slightly increased the risk of incident stone formation in men and older women; there was no association in younger women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Because of the documented health benefits of many foods that are traditionally considered high in oxalate (but still contain 10 mg or less of oxalate per serving), strict oxalate restriction does not seem to be supported. As noted above, some foods traditionally believed to be high in oxalate, such as tea, do not increase the risk of stone formation. For all calcium oxalate stone formers, foods that are very high in oxalate (eg, spinach, potatoes) should be avoided regardless of urine oxalate since there may be a period of very high urinary oxalate excretion soon after the food is consumed. If a low-oxalate diet is recommended, it should only be continued if there is documented evidence that the urine oxalate excretion has fallen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Limit sodium intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcium is reabsorbed passively in the proximal tubule down the favorable concentration gradient created by the reabsorption of sodium and water. A review of renal calcium handling can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diuretics-and-calcium-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diuretics and calcium balance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thus, a low-sodium diet (to 80 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/day)</span> can enhance proximal sodium and calcium reabsorption, leading to a reduction in calcium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/10,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17</a>]. In one study, for example, lowering sodium intake from 200 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/day</span> diminished calcium excretion by as much as 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Although the independent contribution of lowering dietary sodium intake on actual stone formation is unknown and higher sodium intake may be associated with higher urine volume, it is likely an important component of a regimen that has been demonstrated to reduce recurrent stone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/10,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Limit sucrose and fructose intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sucrose intake increases urine calcium independent of calcium intake and has been associated with an increased risk of stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Fructose intake also is associated with an increased risk of stone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Calcium intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Higher urine calcium is a common finding in stone formers, but restricting dietary calcium intake is not recommended unless it is excessive (more than 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/d)</span>. Although urine calcium excretion may decrease with restriction, the decrease in free intestinal calcium can lead to increased absorption of dietary oxalate and enhanced oxalate excretion, due to decreased binding of oxalate by calcium in the intestinal lumen. The net effect may be increased supersaturation of the urine with respect to calcium oxalate and an enhanced tendency to stone formation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for calcium stones in adults&quot;, section on 'Dietary risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>The ability to help prevent new stone formation with a normal calcium intake was shown in part by a five year study that compared two diets among men with idiopathic hypercalciuria and recurrent calcium oxalate stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In this trial, 120 such men were randomly assigned to either a diet consisting of a normal amount of calcium (1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day])</span> and low amounts of animal protein (52 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> and salt (2900 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day]</span> of sodium chloride) or a diet containing a low amount of calcium (400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day])</span>.</p><p>At five years, a significantly <strong>lower</strong> risk of stone recurrence was observed among the group assigned to the normal calcium, low animal protein, low-salt diet (unadjusted relative risk of 0.49 with a CI of 0.24 to 0.98). This selective benefit likely arose because of a decrease in urinary oxalate excretion compared to an increase with the low-calcium diet; the urine calcium actually decreased in both treatment arms. However, the independent effect of calcium is unclear given that the amounts of animal protein and salt ingested among those in the low-calcium diet differed from that of patients in the normal-calcium diet group. Nonetheless, the low calcium intervention was not beneficial and is not recommended.</p><p>In addition to increasing stone formation, a low-calcium diet may have a second deleterious effect in patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria: development of negative calcium balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/1,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21</a>]. This extra loss of calcium can exacerbate the already diminished bone density in some of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>], a complication that may be due to enhanced bone resorption.</p><p>It should be noted that calcium supplements do not appear to be effective in preventing recurrent stones and may even slightly increase risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/14,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for calcium stones in adults&quot;, section on 'Calcium'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with a history of stones who require calcium supplements (eg, for the treatment of osteoporosis), a suggested approach is to measure urinary calcium excretion before and approximately one month after starting the calcium supplement. If there is a clinically important increase in urinary calcium excretion, then the addition of a thiazide diuretic may be useful to reduce urinary calcium excretion (and to help maintain bone density). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'High urine calcium'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Other factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-dose supplemental <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a> appears to increase urine oxalate excretion in certain individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>] and the risk of stone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]; thus, high dose supplements should be avoided in those with higher urine oxalate excretion. Phytate appears to decrease the risk of stones in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Although not simply a matter of dietary intake, higher body mass index increases the risk of stone formation, particularly in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Therefore, weight control may be helpful in preventing stone recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug therapy is indicated if the stone disease remains active (as evidenced by the formation of new stones, enlargement of old stones, or the passage of gravel) or if there is insufficient improvement in the urine chemistries despite attempted dietary modification over a three- to&nbsp;six-month period. The aim of therapy is to prevent further calcium oxalate precipitation; dissolution of already existing calcium stones is highly unlikely (in comparison to uric acid or cystine stones). Thus, passage of an existing stone does not necessarily reflect a therapeutic failure in a patient known to have a renal stone prior to the institution of therapy.</p><p>Initial drug therapy varies with the metabolic abnormality that is present:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thiazide diuretics to reduce urine calcium</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Allopurinol</a> for high urine uric acid</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potassium citrate for low urine citrate</p><p/><p>Patient adherence to diet or medication may become an important issue over the long term. The trials documenting benefit from these interventions required at least three years before the results were significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In an analysis of over 3000 patients followed in a well-organized stone clinic at the University of Chicago, the reduction in urinary supersaturation remained constant or improved over time in those who adhered to yearly follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, only 15 to 40 percent of patients complied with the follow-up requirements by three years. Adherence to long-term therapy among those who did not follow-up was unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">High urine calcium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with high urine calcium that is not due to hypercalcemia (often referred to as idiopathic hypercalciuria) and persistent active stone disease should be treated with a normal-calcium, reduced-animal protein, and low-salt diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], plus a thiazide diuretic such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> (which has a longer half-life). The definition of high urine calcium is arbitrary and the urinary calcium level at which one should consider treatment is not clear, because the relation between urine calcium and risk of stone formation is continuous; if there is evidence of ongoing stone formation, then the urine calcium should be lowered.</p><p>Thiazide therapy can lower calcium excretion by as much as 50 percent. This is primarily by inducing mild volume depletion, leading to a compensatory rise in the proximal reabsorption of sodium, and therefore of passive calcium reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The net effect may be a 90 percent reduction in the incidence of new stones (although there is also an appreciable improvement of 50 to 65 percent in placebo treated patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. In a meta-analysis of five trials of thiazide diuretics compared with standard treatment, thiazide therapy was associated with a significant reduction in the number of new stone recurrences (relative risk 0.52, 95% CI 0.39-0.69) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The full benefit may not be seen unless sodium intake is also restricted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Chlorthalidone can be given once daily, but hydrochlorothiazide at doses above 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> may need to be given twice daily because of its short half-life. Hypokalemia should be avoided since low potassium levels reduce urinary citrate excretion (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Low urine citrate'</a> below). A low-calcium diet should be avoided because it increases the risk of stone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Calcium intake'</a> above).</p><p>The tendency toward positive calcium balance with a thiazide diuretic may have an additional beneficial effect: increasing bone mineralization and decreasing the incidence of hip fracture in older patients (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drugs-that-affect-bone-metabolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drugs that affect bone metabolism&quot;</a>). This will also be helpful in patients who have mistakenly been on a low-calcium <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> high-sodium diet, both of which can lead to negative calcium balance and osteopenia in patients with higher urine calcium.

A repeat 24-hour urine collection should be performed one to two months after initiating therapy. If the urine calcium remains higher than desired, a high sodium intake may be responsible and efforts should be made to reduce sodium excretion below 100 meq (2300 mg) per day. The potassium-sparing diuretic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a> (5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> can also be added since this drug may increase calcium reabsorption in the cortical collecting tubule, further lowering calcium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diuretics-and-calcium-balance#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diuretics and calcium balance&quot;, section on 'Cortical collecting tubule and potassium-sparing diuretics'</a>).&nbsp;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamterene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Triamterene</a> is typically avoided because of the rare possibility of precipitation.</p><p>There are two alternatives if the urine calcium does not fall as desired or the thiazide is not well tolerated. One option is the administration of 40 to 60 meq of alkali per day as potassium bicarbonate or potassium citrate (citrate is rapidly metabolized to bicarbonate) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. <strong>Caution</strong>: Potassium supplements should not routinely be given with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a> since the combination can lead to potassium retention and hyperkalemia.</p><p>Via an unknown mechanism, raising the plasma bicarbonate concentration increases calcium reabsorption and lowers calcium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. For this to occur, however, the potassium salt must be given; the volume expansion induced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> or sodium citrate will increase sodium and therefore calcium excretion, counteracting the effect of the elevation in the plasma bicarbonate concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. The administration of potassium citrate or potassium bicarbonate may have an additional beneficial effect by increasing the urinary excretion of citrate, a potent inhibitor of calcium stone formation (see below).</p><p>The second option is the administration of neutral phosphate (orthophosphate), which may reduce the excretion of calcium and increase the excretion of inhibitors of crystallization (such as pyrophosphate). However, there are no randomized trials documenting the effectiveness of this strategy in preventing stone recurrence.

Multivariate analyses adjusting for other urinary factors revealed no higher likelihood of being a stone former among those with higher urine uric acid. To the contrary, there was a significant inverse association between 24-hour uric acid excretion and the likelihood of stone formation in men.</p><p>Despite the latter findings, two randomized trials and several observational studies have shown benefit from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a> in calcium stone formers with high urine uric acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/35,41,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,41,44,45</a>]. In one trial, 60 patients with high urine uric acid and normocalciuria were assigned to allopurinol or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Allopurinol therapy significantly reduced the likelihood of calcium oxalate stone recurrence (0.12 versus 0.26 per patient per year with placebo) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80273\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80273 \">figure 2</a>). These two apparently conflicting findings raise the possibility that allopurinol may lower the risk through a mechanism other than reducing uric acid excretion. </p><p>In the past, it was suggested that uric acid may act as a nidus for calcium oxalate stone formation, and alkali therapy with potassium citrate (60 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/day)</span> was proposed to be theoretically beneficial since raising the urine pH above 6.0 will convert insoluble uric acid to the much more soluble urate salt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. However, uric acid is no longer believed to act as a nidus. No trials address the benefits of alkali therapy in preventing recurrent calcium oxalate stone formation among patients with high urine uric acid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Low urine citrate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasing urinary citrate excretion is the goal in patients with low urine citrate since citrate inhibits calcium stone formation by forming a poorly dissociable but soluble complex with calcium, thus reducing the amount of calcium available for binding with oxalate or phosphate. Citrate excretion can be enhanced by alkalinizing the plasma by the daily administration of 30 to 80 meq of potassium citrate or potassium bicarbonate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/46,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,48</a>]. In a controlled study of 57 patients, for example, the incidence of new stone formation was lower in patients with low urine citrate treated with potassium citrate (0.1 versus 1.1 events per patient year in the placebo group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]; this benefit was associated with an approximate doubling of citrate excretion. In a meta-analysis of four trials of citrate therapy compared with placebo or no treatment, citrate significantly reduced the incidence of stone recurrence (relative risk 0.25, 95% CI 0.14-0.44) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>In contrast to the beneficial effect of potassium citrate or potassium bicarbonate, a nonalkalinizing salt such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> does not increase citrate excretion in normokalemic subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Although orange juice is a good source of potassium and citrate, it has some undesirable effects: it does not lower calcium excretion; it modestly raises oxalate excretion; and the increase in caloric intake could lead to weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. By comparison, lemon juice has been proposed to be an effective source of citrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. In one report, for example, the ingestion of 4 ounces of lemon juice concentrate per day (mixed with tap water as lemonade for a total volume of 2 liters) resulted in increased urinary citrate levels in 11 of 12 patients (average increase of 142 to 346 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> although it remained in the low range) who were either noncompliant or intolerant of conventional citrate replacement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Active therapy also decreased urinary calcium excretion and did not alter urinary oxalate excretion. However, other citrate-containing low calorie beverages (particularly diet soft drinks that contain large amounts of citrate such as diet Sunkist, diet 7Up) do not appear to be therapeutically useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. The actual alkali content of these beverages was less than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L,</span> including the lemonade recipe above containing 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Further studies of the impact on actual stone formation are required before this approach can be routinely recommended to prevent stone recurrence.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, cranberry juice does not seem to increase urinary citrate levels. This was demonstrated in a study of 24 individuals (12 of whom had prior calcium oxalate stones), in which urinary citrate excretion was the same during water (the control intervention) and cranberry juice intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A possible explanation for the lack of effect is the low potassium content of cranberry juice.</p><p>Alkalinization raises citrate excretion by diminishing the uptake of filtered citrate by the proximal tubular cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The mechanism by which this occurs is related in part to the chemical form of citrate that is present in the lumen. Citrate can exist at a physiologic pH either as a divalent or trivalent anion. Proximal citrate reabsorption (via a sodium-citrate cotransporter in the luminal membrane) preferentially occurs as the divalent anion. Raising the pH in the tubular lumen converts the divalent form into the less reabsorbable trivalent form:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160; &#160; &#160;Citrate(2-) &#160; + &#160; HCO3- &#160; &#160;&mdash;&gt; &#160; &#160;Citrate(3-) &#160; + &#160; CO2 &#160; + &#160; H2O</p></div></div><p>Increasing the systemic pH may enhance citrate excretion by a second mechanism. The associated intracellular alkalosis will diminish citrate metabolism within the cells. The ensuing elevation in the cell citrate concentration will create a less favorable concentration gradient for passive citrate movement from the tubular lumen into the cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/6,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,55</a>].</p><p>The net effect is decreased citrate uptake and increased citrate excretion. In addition to the effect on pH, some of the administered citrate may be excreted directly before being metabolized to bicarbonate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Thus, potassium citrate has a slightly greater citraturic effect than potassium bicarbonate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/46,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,56</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, metabolic acidosis diminishes citrate excretion due to enhanced citrate reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. This effect is mediated both by conversion of citrate(3-) to the more reabsorbable citrate(2-) and by increased citrate metabolism (due to upregulation of the enzyme ATP citrate lyase) within the cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Hypocitraturia probably contributes to the stone formation that is relatively common in patients with untreated distal renal tubular acidosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrolithiasis in renal tubular acidosis&quot;</a>). Care must be taken when providing alkali supplements in patients with calcium phosphate stones (see below).</p><p>Hypokalemia, as may be produced by a thiazide diuretic for example, has a similar stimulatory effect on citrate reabsorption. Potassium moves out of the cells to repair the extracellular deficit and electroneutrality is maintained in part by the movement of extracellular hydrogen into the cells. The intracellular acidosis will enhance citrate metabolism, thereby lowering the cell citrate concentration and creating a more favorable gradient for citrate reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. It is therefore desirable to correct hypokalemia in recurrent stone formers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">High urine oxalate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High urine oxalate can result from ingestion of a diet high in oxalate or factors that can be converted to oxalate (eg, high-dose supplemental <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a>) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> from increased GI absorption of dietary oxalate (enteric hyperoxaluria).

The initial regimen consists of a high fluid intake, potassium alkali salt to correct metabolic acidosis if present, and oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> or citrate (1 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> with meals to bind oxalate in the intestinal lumen.

Although it is has been postulated that manipulation of enteric flora (as with lactic acid bacteria or Oxalobacter formigenes) may also reduce dietary oxalate absorption and urinary oxalate excretion, a randomized placebo-controlled trial found that lactic acid bacteria failed to reduce urinary oxalate excretion; other bacterial formulations have also not been successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">No metabolic abnormality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with recurrent calcium stones have no identifiable metabolic abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/31,43,62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,43,62,63</a>].

This is the likely explanation for these patients with no metabolic abnormality, because there appears to be a graded increase in stone risk that begins when the rate of urinary excretion is still within the normal range. If a patient has evidence of stone growth or new stone formation, then one or more of the relevant urinary factors needs to be modified by diet <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medication.</p><p>This important principle was illustrated in a cross-sectional observational study of 3350 men and women, of whom 2237 had a history of nephrolithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Although the stone composition was unknown in many cases, the demographics of the participants and a validation study suggest that more than 80 percent were likely to have had calcium oxalate stones.</p><p>The following results were noted in the different biochemical categories; most of the values were significantly different from the comparator:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared to a 24-hour urinary calcium excretion below 100 mg in older women, the relative risk of being a stone former was 1.5 at a urinary calcium of 150 to 199 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> 1.8 at a urinary calcium of 200 to 249 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> and 1.9 at a urinary calcium of 250 to 299 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.

Hypocitraturia has often been defined as citrate excretion below 320 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p/><p>Stone formers also tend to have a lower urine volume, another factor that could promote stone formation. In one report, for example, patients with a first stone and who subsequently formed another stone had a baseline daily urine output that was 250 to 350 mL less than those who did not form another stone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In some patients, the only abnormality may be a low urine volume leading to high concentration of calcium and oxalate.</p><p>This emphasizes the importance of considering the <strong>concentrations</strong> of urinary factors and not simply the absolute amount of excretion. As an example, even if the urine calcium is not in the traditionally accepted elevated urine calcium range, the urine calcium concentration will be high when the urine volume is low. If the urine volume cannot be consistently maintained at a higher level, the urine calcium must therefore be reduced to lower the calcium concentration.</p><p>There is some suggestive evidence that lowering calcium excretion with a thiazide diuretic may be beneficial, even in patients who do not have high urine calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

We therefore recommend the following for all patients with calcium oxalate stones:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sufficient fluid intake distributed throughout the day to produce at least 2 liters of urine per day, including drinking at night (although it is not essential that the patient wake up several times per night to urinate).

The response to dietary or drug therapy is monitored by repeat 24-hour urine collections. It is essential that all the relevant urinary factors be monitored in individuals with calcium oxalate stones as they often have more than one urinary abnormality. Although remnant stones may theoretically consume urinary constituents and thus lower their measured urinary concentration, the potential error from a stone being present is much less than the variability due to dietary intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-established-nephrolithiasis-and-treatment-if-stone-composition-is-unknown#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult patient with established nephrolithiasis and treatment if stone composition is unknown&quot;, section on '24-hour urine collections'</a>.)</p><p>The goal of therapy is to reverse the abnormalities detected during the initial workup (eg, low urine volume, hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia, and hyperoxaluria). We routinely obtain a 24-hour urine collection at six to eight weeks after therapy has begun to assess the impact of the intervention. If the desired changes have taken place, repeat values are obtained at six months and then at yearly intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. If urinary abnormalities persist, additional therapy is required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collection-of-a-24-hour-urine-specimen-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Collection of a 24-hour urine specimen (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important to emphasize that it is urinary supersaturation that must be reduced, not simply the concentration of a particular reactant (such as calcium). Supersaturation can be calculated from the 24-hour urine collection when performed in an experienced laboratory. Although the supersaturation is not perfectly predictive, it can be used as a guide to monitor the overall impact of the interventions. An absolute cutoff for &quot;abnormal&quot; supersaturation has not been defined, rather the risk decreases as the supersaturation decreases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-established-nephrolithiasis-and-treatment-if-stone-composition-is-unknown#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult patient with established nephrolithiasis and treatment if stone composition is unknown&quot;, section on '24-hour urine collections'</a>.)</p><p>Another component of monitoring is periodic imaging. Helical computed tomography (CT) is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality (relative to plain X-ray and ultrasound) to assess the number, size and location of stones. However, CT is associated with higher radiation exposure and cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Thus, ultrasound or KUB is frequently used to determine if new stones have formed or previous stones have increased in size.</p><p>Ultrasound or KUB should be performed at one year and, if negative, every two to four years thereafter depending upon the severity of persistent urinary abnormalities. We choose ultrasound or KUB depending upon which the stone was best seen to allow for comparability. Limiting radiation exposure is important, as individuals with recurrent stones often have undergone multiple imaging procedures around the times of acute stone events.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">CALCIUM PHOSPHATE STONES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, patients with calcium phosphate stones have the same risk factors as those with calcium oxalate stones (except for hyperoxaluria); as a result, therapy for recurrent stone formation is similar in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>However, most calcium phosphate stone formers have a persistently elevated urine pH (usually above 6.0) often due to overt or incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis. Although the administration of alkali (preferably potassium citrate) in this setting may diminish the frequency of stone growth or new formation, it could also increase the risk by raising the urine pH, thereby increasing the likelihood of calcium phosphate crystal formation. Therefore, alkali therapy must be undertaken with caution. Urine pH and citrate should be monitored, and supplemental alkali should be discontinued if urine pH rises above 6.5 without a substantial increase in the urine citrate or decrease in the urine calcium.

Achieving these goals may require both dietary modification and the administration of appropriate medications. Metabolic evaluation at baseline and during follow-up will help guide the choice of the optimal preventive regimen. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of dietary modifications and drug therapies can reduce the likelihood of recurrence of calcium oxalate stones. From the viewpoint of diet, ensuring adequate intake of dietary calcium as well as increasing the intake of fluid, potassium, and phytate and decreasing the intake of oxalate, animal protein, sucrose, fructose, sodium, supplemental calcium, and supplemental <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a> may be beneficial. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Dietary modification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among those with calcium oxalate stones, drug therapy is indicated if there is continued stone formation or if there is insufficient improvement in the urine chemistries despite attempted dietary modification over a three- to&nbsp;six-month period. The aim of therapy is to prevent further calcium oxalate precipitation. Since dissolution of already existing calcium stones does not occur, passage of an existing stone does not necessarily reflect a therapeutic failure in a patient known to have renal stones prior to the institution of therapy. Initial drug therapy varies with the metabolic abnormality that is present. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Drug therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Summary'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 24-hour urine is an essential component of the initial evaluation and guides recommendations for prevention. The response to dietary or drug therapy is monitored by repeat 24-hour urine collections. The goal of therapy is to reverse the abnormalities detected during the initial workup (eg, low urine volume, hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia, and hyperoxaluria). We routinely obtain a 24-hour urine collection at six to eight weeks after therapy has begun to assess the impact of the intervention. Another component of monitoring is periodic imaging. Limiting radiation exposure is important, as individuals with recurrent stones often have undergone multiple imaging procedures around the times of acute stone events. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring of response'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Taylor EN, Curhan GC.
