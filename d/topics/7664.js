To increase the accessibility and convenience of care to chronically ill patients and potentially decrease associated costs, many therapies, including transfusions, are occasionally provided in patients' homes or physicians' offices. The indications for home blood transfusion are similar to those in other health care settings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in adults: Storage, specialized modifications, and infusion parameters&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is at least one major factor that distinguishes the administration of blood in a home setting from transfusion in a hospital: the decreased availability of emergency medical care for managing serious complications. This inherent difference compounds the usual and sometimes serious risks of transfusion. Thus, patient safety is a higher priority than increased convenience and any cost savings that may be realized in home-based therapies.</p><p>Important aspects of home transfusion will be reviewed here, with a focus on recipient safety. Several key references that should be consulted prior to setting up a home transfusion program will be mentioned.</p><p>Standardized procedures for maximizing the safety of home blood transfusion are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-path-to-safer-home-transfusion-standard-operating-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The path to safer home transfusion: Standard operating procedures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHOM TO CONSULT AND WHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activities related to the collection, processing, issuing, and transfusion of blood and blood components are regulated by government agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or individual states. Standards applicable to these processes have been promulgated by organizations such as the AABB (formerly the American Association of Blood Banks), College of American Pathologists (CAP), and The Joint Commission. Physicians wishing to order home transfusions should be familiar with applicable standards and regulations. Presumably, a blood center or hospital transfusion service would not issue blood to a health care provider or agency that does not have transfusion procedures meeting regulations and industry standards.</p><p>The foundation of the safety and regulatory infrastructure consists of detailed standard operating procedures (SOPs) for each aspect of the transfusion process, from ordering blood to collecting pre-transfusion compatibility testing specimens, storing and transporting components, infusion, and proper handling of biohazardous materials such as blood bags and tubing. Documentation, retention of records, staff training and periodic competency assessment are also required.</p><p>Resources pertaining to transfusion regulations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> practices are widely available and include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An authoritative textbook on transfusion and blood banking practices</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The AABB Technical Manual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Circular of Information for the Use of Human Blood and Blood Components from the AABB, American Red Cross, America's Blood Centers, and the Armed Services Blood Program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Compendium of Transfusion Practice Guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]</p><p/><p>Medical directors of community blood centers and hospital-based transfusion services frequently have specialty training in transfusion medicine and are knowledgeable about applicable regulations. The AABB issues standards for transfusion activities, and has published guidelines for home transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Although the FDA does not regulate the clinical practice of Transfusion Medicine, it exercises regulatory oversight of blood collection, processing, quality assurance, and relevant current Good Manufacturing Processes (cGMPs) through the publication of the Code of Federal Regulations and various guidance documents, memoranda, and recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There is also a small body of peer-reviewed home transfusion literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A common model for providing transfusion services in a patient's home involves an arrangement between a home health agency (HHA) that transfuses the blood and a community blood center or hospital transfusion service (HTS) that provides the blood components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>After blood is ordered, the HHA transfusionist (usually a licensed nurse) visits the patient's residence, collects and labels blood specimens for pre-transfusion testing, and places a wrist band or other standard health care type of identification on the patient. During the pre-transfusion and transfusion visits, patient identification is critical and involves ensuring accuracy of the wrist band information and having the patient state <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> name and birth date (or another numeric identifier). These safety checks link specimens, the patient, and units intended for transfusion. Preferably, the patient should confirm <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> identity and key information such as date of birth by showing a government-issued or other official form of photo identification.</p><p>At the time of this initial visit, the home should be assessed for its proximity to a hospital or urgent care facility. If the home is in a remote site and access to critical care could be delayed, consideration should be given to transfusing the patient in an outpatient facility or hospital. The actual transfusion location within the home should be evaluated to ensure that emergency personnel can reach the patient for treatment and transport. In the preliminary visit, the transfusionist can also determine whether the patient's physical and mental status are appropriate for home transfusion and confirm that a cell phone or working land line telephone and another responsible adult are available for summoning emergency assistance if a serious transfusion reaction occurs.</p><p>Pre-transfusion specimens are delivered to the community blood center or HTS, where <span class=\"nowrap\">ABO/Rh</span> typing, antibody screening, and compatibility testing are performed. Components are packaged for shipping according to specific federal and other regulatory guidelines and transported by the transfusionist to the patient's home. During this visit, the nurse obtains informed consent (if not done previously), begins an infusion of physiologic saline, and transfuses the blood. The nurse remains with the patient during the entire transfusion and for at least another 30 minutes to monitor for possible later-appearing sequelae. Blood bags, tubing, and disposables are returned to the issuer for proper disposal.</p><p>Another model for home transfusion involves the direct provision of home services by the HTS or community blood center without an intermediary organization such as a HHA. In this approach, the transfusionists are employees of the hospital or blood center.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICIAN ROLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transfusion outside the hospital setting offers physicians a unique patient care opportunity, but one that by its novel nature may require more personal involvement than hospital-based transfusion. Because patient safety could potentially be compromised by limited availability of emergency care services, physicians must anticipate and plan for off-site management of acute transfusion-related medical emergencies.</p><p>Physician preparedness involves availability to and knowledge about transfusing personnel. Many HHAs require that the physician be notified just prior to infusion and be available at all times during blood administration. The physician must be familiar with each agency's procedures for recognizing and managing acute reactions, and may, in fact, want to participate in developing such procedures. The doctor should also decide what medications the transfusionist should have on hand for treating complications. Examples are antipyretics, antihistamines to treat minor allergic reactions, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> to treat rare but potentially catastrophic anaphylaxis. Physicians should ascertain that the competence and experience of the transfusionist are commensurate with the risk of out-of-hospital transfusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT PROFILE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Home transfusion could be appropriate for chronic conditions associated with anemia or thrombocytopenia. One of the few reviews of home transfusion, performed by one community blood center, showed that more than 60 percent of red blood cell products were administered to patients with malignancies, HIV-related conditions, or non-specified anemias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Less common indications were hemoglobinopathies, gastrointestinal bleeding, and renal failure. Myelodysplastic syndromes comprise another group of disorders successfully managed by home transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>The prospective recipient must be medically stable. Patients with compromised cardiac or pulmonary function or who have other serious conditions should be transfused in a hospital or outpatient facility. If the patient has an autoantibody or alloantibody, and compatible blood is not available, transfusion should take place in a hospital setting where the patient can be closely monitored. (See <a href=\"#H13626826\" class=\"local\">'Exclusion criteria'</a> below.)</p><p>Home or office transfusion is an appropriate service if patients have physical or emotional impediments to leaving their homes or traveling, but should not be offered exclusively for the sake of convenience. Patients must be alert and oriented so that they can give informed consent and communicate symptoms of a possible reaction. Some children are candidates for home transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], but should be mature enough to demonstrate an understanding of the process and able to communicate symptoms that could be related to the transfusion.</p><p>Finally, patients who are possible candidates for home transfusion should have a history of previous transfusion without severe or repeated reactions. Although this has been the subject of debate, it is an AABB patient selection criterion that should be considered when making home transfusion decisions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPONENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the sake of this article, blood components are defined as products manufactured from whole blood (eg, red blood cells [RBCs], plasma, platelets, or Cryoprecipitate) or those collected by apheresis such as platelets, plasma, or RBCs. Pharmaceutical products, including albumin, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>, and clotting factor concentrates, are not included in this discussion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-cryoprecipitate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of Cryoprecipitate&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Blood components can be ordered from community blood centers or hospital transfusion services that have an established arrangement with a specific physician's office or home health agency. Red blood cells are most frequently ordered, but platelets or plasma may also be requested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Some facilities limit the total number of components for each transfusion event to two products, for example, two units of RBCs or a unit of RBCs and an apheresis platelet unit. The rationale for these limits is the avoidance of transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO). The appropriateness of home transfusion for patients requiring more than one or two units should be questioned as well. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco#H27658918\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>Cryoprecipitate could be appropriately transfused in a nontraditional setting if a patient has a specific clotting factor deficiency for which a factor concentrate is not available. However, with the growing array of pharmaceutically manufactured clotting factors, it is possibly unlikely that Cryoprecipitate would be transfused in an out-of-hospital setting for this indication. Patients requiring granulocyte transfusions are almost always severely neutropenic and septic, and thus would be considered too ill to be transfused in any place other than a hospital. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=granulocyte-transfusions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Granulocyte transfusions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Special considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To avoid the possible occurrence of febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTRs), it is recommended that RBCs and platelets undergo leukofiltration at the time of collection or shortly thereafter (&quot;prestorage leukoreduction&quot;) to decrease leukocyte content, thereby reducing the accumulation of white blood cell-generated cytokines that are associated with FNHTRs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. It is standard manufacturing practice for many blood centers in the United States to issue RBCs and platelets that have already undergone leukoreduction, but if there is uncertainty about the policies or procedures of the regional blood center or collecting hospital, ordering physicians should make appropriate inquiries of the blood provider. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukoreduction to prevent complications of blood transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If leukoreduced RBCs are not available, bedside filtration is another, although not optimal, alternative. This may be associated with an increased risk of FNHTRs due to higher concentrations of cytokines that have accumulated during storage but are not removed by filters. Transfusing staff should follow the manufacturer's instructions for use of the filter.</p><p>For platelet transfusions, single donor apheresis platelets are preferable to pooled whole blood-derived platelet concentrates that are associated with an increased number of allogeneic blood exposures. Most leukocytes are automatically removed during apheresis, so bedside filtration would not be necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13626704\"><span class=\"h1\">FREQUENCY OF TRANSFUSION REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Literature dealing with home transfusion complications is limited, but suggests that complications are infrequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>]. In an Italian study of 211 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes who received red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, only six non-venipuncture-related complications were reported in 4980 home transfusion encounters involving 7766 transfused units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. All transfusions were performed by physicians (which would be unusual in the US). Two temperature elevations and one cutaneous reaction were noted. Three reactions that may have been more significant, and serve as a reminder that these can indeed occur in the home setting, were cardiovascular symptoms due to fluid overload, and one episode of nausea and vomiting that was not characterized further but is observed in ABO incompatibility and other types of hemolysis.</p><p>Older adult patients likely comprise the majority of people undergoing home transfusion and represent a cohort of patients who potentially are at increased risk for some types of significant reactions. The US Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) utilized International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9-CM diagnosis codes from CMS databases to report on the rates of major transfusion reactions in 492,339 elderly outpatients receiving transfusions over a two-year period; the major reactions assessed were transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and ABO incompatibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The percentage of transfusions that were given in the home (rather than hospital) setting was not stated. The following findings were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TRALI rates were higher among patients who received a combination of leukoreduced (LR) RBCs and LR platelets, compared with LR RBCs alone (14.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/100,000</span> versus 1.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/100,000)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The TRALI rates for irradiated (IR) RBCs and IR platelets were 36.<span class=\"nowrap\">4/100,000</span> and 14.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/100,000</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ABO incompatibility rate was higher for IR LR RBCs versus LR RBCs <span class=\"nowrap\">(44/100,000</span> versus 1.<span class=\"nowrap\">2/100,000</span> during the first year of observation).</p><p/><p>Clinical and laboratory data for each reaction were not described, and mistransfusion or other errors that could result in ABO incompatibility were not discussed. The authors hypothesized that irradiation-induced cellular membrane changes; underlying patient conditions, including ABO group changes or complications associated with hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation; and other etiologies may have contributed to the incidence of ABO incompatibility, and the authors called for additional research related to the reported complications. Irradiation of blood components prevents transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and in patients with increased risk of transfusion-associated GVHD (eg, immunocompromised patients), the known benefits of irradiation would outweigh the potential, yet unproven, increased risks of TRALI or ABO incompatibility suggested by the large CMS database study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. It should be noted that irradiation of cellular products has not been otherwise reported to be associated with an increased risk of TRALI or ABO incompatibility.</p><p>Minimizing morbidity and mortality due to a transfusion reaction primarily resides in the transfusionist's ability to quickly recognize, diagnose, and treat transfusion reactions. The absence of on-site physician staff, equipment, and resources normally available in a hospital potentially pose significant safety hazards. For this reason, only transfusionists who have been trained and are experienced in transfusion therapy should transfuse in non-hospital settings. Further, the attending physician must be immediately available by land line or cell phone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13626751\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transfusion reactions are usually identified by the subjective reporting of symptoms by the patient, objective observations by the health care professional in attendance of a change in the physical condition of the patient, or changes in the patient's vital signs. The patient's temperature, pulse, blood pressure and respiratory rate should be taken prior to the transfusion; at least every 15 minutes during the first 45 minutes of the transfusion and, if stable, every 30 minutes thereafter or more frequently; at the conclusion of the transfusion; and at least 15 or 30 minutes after the transfusion has ended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Minor transfusion complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Febrile, nonhemolytic transfusion reactions are not life-threatening. However, they must be distinguished from hemolytic reactions because chills and an increase in temperature occur in both. When these symptoms appear, the transfusion must be discontinued, and the attending physician and blood bank notified. Blood specimens should be collected in the type of tube required by the facility that will be performing assays for evidence of hemolysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-acute-transfusion-reaction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with a suspected acute transfusion reaction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The transfusionist should make arrangements for delivery of the specimens to the blood center but should not leave the patient until it is considered safe to do so. Blood bank staff should be able to contact the physician immediately if there is evidence of hemolysis, and the patient should be transported to a care facility.</p><p>Unless leukoreduction of cellular units is not routinely performed, febrile, non-hemolytic transfusion reactions are much less likely to be recurring phenomena. Hospital-based transfusion should be considered for patients with recurring reactions.</p><p>Allergic reactions, characterized by urticaria and hives, are managed by discontinuing the infusion and notifying the attending physician. If there is no evidence that the patient is having an anaphylactic reaction (also sometimes initially characterized by urticaria and pruritus), the physician may decide to resume the transfusion cautiously if the symptoms have responded to antihistamines. If a patient has a history of repeated allergic reactions or severe allergic reactions, consideration should be given to transfusing in a hospital setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunologic-transfusion-reactions#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunologic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Urticarial (allergic) reactions'</a>.)</p><p>The occurrence of allergic and febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTRs) with platelet transfusions can be reduced by transfusion of a newer product, apheresis platelets with additive solution (PAS platelets), in which approximately two-thirds of the plasma is replaced with a propriety additive solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Major transfusion complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reactions that are most likely to result in significant morbidity or even mortality include hemolytic reactions, fluid overload, bacterial sepsis, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), and anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/1,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,26</a>]. All of these complications warrant immediate cessation of the transfusion; appropriate bedside interventions when indicated, available, and time-feasible; and transfer of the patient to a hospital. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-acute-transfusion-reaction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with a suspected acute transfusion reaction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A hemolytic transfusion reaction should be suspected if there is a rise in temperature, chills, back pain, nausea and vomiting, dark-colored or red urine, or any of the other usual symptoms. If the bedside clerical check demonstrates that the wrong unit is being transfused, the suspicion of a hemolytic reaction should be very high. If the patient is stable, has no other findings or symptoms beyond fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chills, and it has been confirmed that a mistransfusion has not occurred, the physician may decide to await the results of serologic tests for hemolysis before sending the patient to a hospital; otherwise the transfusionist should expeditiously make transport arrangements.</p><p>The evaluation for a hemolytic transfusion reaction is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemolytic-transfusion-reactions#H354779\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemolytic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and immediate management of AHTR'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Fluid overload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluid overload requires immediate intervention. The transfusionist should discontinue the transfusion, put the patient in an upright position to facilitate respiration, and start oxygen if available. Administration of diuretics should be considered if there is clear evidence that TRALI is the not cause of the patient&rsquo;s respiratory symptoms. The physician should be contacted and arrangements made to transport the patient to an appropriate health care facility.</p><p>Additional issues in the management of transfusional fluid overload are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-associated-circulatory-overload-taco#H3077224007\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Bacterial contamination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on one of the few prospective studies on bacterial contamination, an estimated per-unit risk of red cells was approximately <span class=\"nowrap\">1/32,000</span> units transfused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. As a result of the implementation of bacterial culturing of platelets, largely in response to a 2004 AABB standard requiring such testing, the risk of transfusing bacterially contaminated platelets has been meaningfully reduced. Although earlier reports indicated that bacteria were detected in approximately <span class=\"nowrap\">1/5200</span> cultured (but not transfused) plateletpheresis units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], a study using higher sample volumes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anaerobic assays (in addition to routine aerobic culturing) suggested that contamination rates could be as high as approximately <span class=\"nowrap\">1/1000</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].

The sudden onset of fever, rigors, severe changes in systolic blood pressure, flushing, or other symptoms, call for immediate supportive measures and emergency transport to a hospital. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">TRALI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is characterized by acute dyspnea and oxygen desaturation that may occur shortly after transfusion is initiated but can occur up to six hours after transfusion. Other symptoms may include cough, fever, chills, and hypotension. Radiologically, TRALI presents with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. It can be caused by all blood components and is attributed mainly to donor HLA or human neutrophil antigen (HNA) antibodies against cognate recipient HLA or HNA antigens, predominantly from plasma-containing products donated by women who have been pregnant. TRALI can also be caused by recipient antibodies directed against donor white cells or biologically active breakdown products that can accumulate in cellular components. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because access to chest x-ray or other imaging studies is unlikely in a home environment, TRALI may be difficult to distinguish clinically from fluid overload. Clues that could favor the diagnosis of TRALI and guide the decision to withhold diuretics on that basis would be the occurrence of acute dyspnea developing rapidly after starting the transfusion or after only a small volume has been transfused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-36</a>]. This clinical scenario generally does not occur so soon after transfusion is started, however; therefore, oxygen should be started immediately and emergency services summoned to transport the patient to a hospital.</p><p>The risk of TRALI has been reduced, but not totally eliminated, by providing plasma and platelets from male donors or female donors who either have no history of pregnancy or no evidence of white blood cell alloimmunization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Estimates vary by distributed components, with a risk for RBC of <span class=\"nowrap\">1/480,000</span> units; male plasma <span class=\"nowrap\">1/240,000</span> units; and <span class=\"nowrap\">1/138,000</span> for platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/31,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,39</a>].

Prompt recognition and administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> by the transfusionist could prevent the patient's death. This represents a scenario in which the transfusionist could be authorized in advance to administer medication without awaiting a physician's order. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunologic-transfusion-reactions#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunologic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Anaphylactic transfusion reactions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13626826\"><span class=\"h1\">EXCLUSION CRITERIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inclusion and exclusion criteria for home transfusion should be established by the blood provider, hospital blood bank physician, ordering physicians, and medical personnel of the transfusing agency. The hospital transfusion committee and medical executive committee are also appropriate participants in these discussions.</p><p>Examples of exclusion criteria for home transfusion include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-of-home-blood-transfusion/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient unable or refuses to give consent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient unable to provide information for purposes of identification</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inaccessibility to emergency services</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical layout of home inaccessible to emergency personnel</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No land line available; no cell phone signal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Covering physician not available</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Responsible adult (beside transfusionist) not available</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiovascular instability, major pulmonary compromise, or other severe underlying medical condition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of significant transfusion complication or repeated reactions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compatible RBC units not available (eg, patient has autoantibody or alloantibody)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18825680\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an effort to increase the accessibility and convenience of care to chronically ill patients, transfusions are occasionally given in patients' homes or physicians' offices, although the decreased availability of emergency medical care for serious complications is a major limitation. Several issues need to be addressed to maximize safety. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After blood is ordered, the transfusionist visits the patient's residence, collects and labels blood specimens for pre-transfusion testing, and puts an identification band on the patient. The home should be assessed for its proximity to a hospital or urgent care facility. (See <a href=\"#H13626826\" class=\"local\">'Exclusion criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The transfusionist must affirm that the patient's physical and mental status are appropriate for home transfusion, and that a cell phone or land line and another responsible adult are available in the home. The nurse remains with the patient during the entire transfusion and for at least 30 minutes following the infusion in order to monitor for late-appearing sequelae. (See <a href=\"#H13626826\" class=\"local\">'Exclusion criteria'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prospective recipient must be medically stable; those with compromised cardiac or pulmonary function or who have other serious conditions should be transfused in a hospital or outpatient facility. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Patient profile'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The chance of minimizing a patient's morbidity and mortality due to a transfusion reaction primarily resides in the transfusionist's ability to expeditiously recognize, diagnose, and treat reactions. Only transfusionists who have been trained and are experienced in transfusion therapy should be permitted to transfuse in non-hospital settings. The attending physician must be immediately available by telephone during the transfusion.
