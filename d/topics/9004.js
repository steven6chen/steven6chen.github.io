More than half of patients report that insomnia predated the onset of drinking by more than 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/5,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,18</a>].</p><p>Longitudinal studies have found that sleep problems and insomnia in childhood and adolescence are associated with early initiation of alcohol, cannabis, and other illicit drugs and greater alcohol and drug misuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Persistent use of substances of abuse can directly disrupt neurobiological systems that regulate sleep and wakefulness, potentially leading to insomnia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5772943\"><span class=\"h2\">Association with relapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep disturbances are an important risk factor for relapse in patients with alcohol use disorder. Among subjective symptoms, difficulty falling asleep is the most consistent indicator of increased relapse risk in the first six months following treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].

Abnormalities in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep at the time of inpatient treatment that are consistent with increased REM pressure (eg, shorter REM latency, increased REM percent, and increased REM density) have also been associated with greater likelihood of relapse to drinking within three to six months after discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>Sleep disturbances may also predict relapse to substances other than alcohol, but data are less consistent and prospective studies are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. One study in cocaine-dependent patients found that more REM sleep and a greater increase in deep slow wave sleep over two weeks of abstinence were positively associated with abstinence over the next six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Others have found an association between certain quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) findings, such as high frequency beta activity during wakefulness, and relapse among individuals in a residential substance recovery program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5772955\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Substances of abuse directly alter the homeostatic balance of several neurotransmitter systems that are intimately involved in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness, including acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine, glutamate, norepinephrine, adenosine, and orexin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/22,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,35</a>].</p><p>The pathophysiology of insomnia in patients recovering from substance use disorders is multifactorial, and studies have focused on several potential mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central nervous system (CNS) hyperarousal &ndash; Patients recovering from alcohol dependence exhibit nighttime electroencephalography (EEG) patterns that are consistent with abnormal arousal levels. Beta EEG activity during sleep, a marker of CNS hyperarousal, is more prominent in abstinent patients with a history of alcohol dependence than in controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>] and is higher in patients who subsequently relapse compared with those who remain abstinent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic polymorphisms &ndash; A specific polymorphism of <em>PER3</em>, a gene involved in sleep regulation, has been associated with insomnia in patients with alcohol use disorder. In one study, patients who were homozygous for the four-repeat allele of <em>PER3</em>, associated with evening circadian preference, had worse insomnia symptom severity than patients homozygous for the morning circadian preference five-repeat allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circadian rhythm abnormalities &ndash; Melatonin and cortisol, which are the primary neurohormones of the circadian system, have been shown to be disrupted in patients with alcohol dependence. Reduced melatonin levels are evident during acute withdrawal from alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] and with continued abstinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In a controlled laboratory study, abstinent men had reduced melatonin levels at the beginning of the night and a 90-minute delay in peak melatonin secretion compared with healthy sleepers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. They also showed abnormal nighttime cortisol profiles compared with controls, with lower cortisol levels early in the night and higher levels later in the night. Another study found a slower rate of rise and lower maximum amplitude of the melatonin rhythm in alcohol-dependent patients compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Homeostatic system abnormalities &ndash; Other research has focused on the homeostatic sleep regulatory system, which reflects the biological sleep drive. Compared with healthy controls, abstinent men with a history of alcohol dependence have reduced deep slow wave (delta) EEG activity over the whole night and during the first non-rapid eye movement (NREM) period, when delta activity is typically highest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Delta sleep deficits have also been identified in healthy sleeping children with a parental history of alcohol use disorder, conferring increased risk for sleep disruption later in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. When sleep deprived, patients with alcohol dependence fail to respond with an appropriate increase in slow wave sleep or delta power [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Instead, these patients show a blunted slow wave activity response when bedtime is delayed compared with healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Dysregulation of the homeostatic sleep system has also been posited as a cause of sleep disturbances in patients who abuse cocaine and in patients with opioid use disorder on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> maintenance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5772991\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical characteristics of insomnia in patients with substance use disorders vary based on the specific substance of abuse and whether an individual is actively using, in acute withdrawal, or in abstinence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F106293\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106293 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5772997\"><span class=\"h2\">Alcohol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common sleep complaints associated with both chronic use of alcohol and abstinence from alcohol are difficulties falling asleep, staying asleep, or a combination of the two (so-called mixed insomnia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>].

More than half of patients report that insomnia predated the onset of drinking by more than 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/5,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,18</a>].</p><p>The normal circadian pattern of sleep and wakefulness can also be disrupted in patients who are actively using alcohol. Polyphasic sleep-wake cycles can occur in some patients, characterized by multiple brief bouts of binge drinking-induced sleep followed by brief periods of wakefulness.</p><p>Patients with alcohol use disorder who are in the first year of recovery show longer sleep latencies on wrist actigraphy than individuals with insomnia and chronic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In the first few months of recovery, polysomnography demonstrates increased sleep latency and light stage N1 sleep, decreased slow wave sleep, sleep efficiency, and total sleep time, and more abnormalities in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep compared with healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>].

Objective changes in sleep are not well characterized.</p><p>In contrast, withdrawal from cannabis is reliably associated with sleep complaints, most commonly difficulty falling asleep. One large study of 469 non-treatment-seeking cannabis smokers found that more than 33 percent reported insomnia symptoms upon quitting cannabis, including trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, waking up earlier than desired, and sleeping less than usual. Symptoms began within five days of quitting and persisted for as long as two years, the longest of any self-reported withdrawal symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>A polysomnographic study in chronic heavy cannabis users demonstrated similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Compared with baseline, the first two days of withdrawal were associated with lower total sleep time, worse sleep efficiency, longer sleep latency, shorter REM latency, and lower slow wave sleep. The effects were not related to the amount or duration of cannabis use, severity of withdrawal symptoms, amount of craving, or mood. Total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and REM sleep continued to decline across 14 days of abstinence, while wakefulness during the night and periodic limb movements in sleep increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

When taken intranasally before bed, cocaine objectively increases sleep latency and REM sleep latency and decreases sleep efficiency and REM sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/47,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,59</a>].</p><p>During acute withdrawal from cocaine, patients report sleep disturbances, hypersomnia, and unpleasant dreams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. Reports of subjective sleep quality improve steadily during the first few weeks of abstinence, which contrasts with an objective worsening of sleep latency, sleep efficiency, REM latency, and both total and REM sleep time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insomnia-in-patients-with-a-substance-use-disorder/abstract/47,61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,61,62</a>].

Sleep problems may contribute to the initial development of a substance use disorder, are exacerbated by chronic substance use, and frequently persist well into abstinence. (See <a href=\"#H313925057\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insomnia during recovery has been consistently linked with relapse, thus close attention should be paid to insomnia during recovery. Although sleep improves with abstinence and with significant reductions in substance use, most patients will continue to experience insomnia that often requires independent treatment. (See <a href=\"#H5772991\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluating the causes and contributors to insomnia complaints can begin early in the recovery process. A sleep history and review of <span class=\"nowrap\">sleep/wake</span> diaries are the core components of the evaluation. Polysomnography is not routinely indicated unless there are signs or symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing. (See <a href=\"#H5773086\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Independent insomnia treatment should generally be initiated during recovery from substance abuse; patients who are actively abusing substances should be referred for substance treatment first. When insomnia symptoms occur at least three times per week, persist beyond one to three months of abstinence, and are accompanied by daytime impairments <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychological distress, adjunctive insomnia treatments should be initiated. (See <a href=\"#H3639663985\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial management of insomnia should include evaluating causes and contributors to insomnia and emphasizing the importance of good sleep hygiene. (See <a href=\"#H2123724454\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with persistent insomnia symptoms during recovery, we recommend cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) rather than drug therapy as a first-line approach (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). CBT-I has established efficacy for insomnia in the general population and is the best-studied nonpharmacologic approach in patients with substance use disorders. (See <a href=\"#H194127414\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benzodiazepine receptor agonist medications should be avoided in patients with a substance use disorder because of the increased likelihood of abuse and potential for overdose when mixed with alcohol or other substances. Safer alternatives, albeit with limited evidence of efficacy, include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trazodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trazodone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, and melatonin agonists.
