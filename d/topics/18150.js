Sprue is an Anglicized form of the Dutch word &quot;sprouw,&rdquo; a term applied in 1669 to a chronic diarrheal disease of unknown etiology accompanied by aphthous ulcers that was prevalent in Belgium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The designation tropical sprue was coined in 1880 by Sir Patrick Manson, an English tropical disease expert working in China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tropical sprue occurs in the tropics in a narrow band north and south of the equator to 30&deg; latitude; however, the disease does not occur in all countries within this band [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the Western hemisphere, tropical sprue is particularly prevalent in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Cuba, but is rare or absent in Jamaica and the Bahamas. Tropical sprue is also common in India and to a lesser degree in Burma, Indonesia, Borneo, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam, but is uncommon in Africa, China, and the Middle East [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Only rare cases of tropical sprue have been reported in the United States.</p><p>The disease affects indigenous populations as well as visitors to the tropics who stay for more than a month. Tropical sprue is seldom seen in travelers who visit an endemic area for less than two weeks. </p><p>Although accurate data are not available, the incidence of tropical sprue appears to be declining. In India, the incidence of tropical sprue is decreasing, and Crohn disease and celiac disease are becoming the more common causes of malabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. This decline in incidence is likely due to improved public hygiene, the widespread use of antibiotics, and more accurate serologic tests for celiac disease, which can mimic tropical sprue in its presentation and pathology. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of observations support the hypothesis that tropical sprue is an infectious disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/3,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7-9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some patients, the disease follows an acute diarrheal illness typical of infectious enteritis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidemics of acute diarrhea in households and communities have been documented, particularly in India where the disease is common. The majority of such patients recover, while only some develop tropical sprue. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with tropical sprue have overgrowth of toxigenic coliform bacteria (<em>Klebsiella, E. coli</em>, and <em>Enterobacter</em>) in the proximal small intestine, as discussed below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics is usually curative (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Treatment and prognosis'</a> below).</p><p/><p>A role for bacterial overgrowth has been suggested in several reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one report in India, coliform bacteria were found in the upper small bowel in two-thirds of patients with tropical sprue, but also in one-half of controls, many of whom had chronic diarrhea without the typical diagnostic features of tropical sprue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similar results were found in another report from India in which 13 patients with tropical sprue were compared with 12 patients with irritable bowel syndrome and 12 healthy subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Bacterial contamination in the proximal small bowel was observed in 10 of the 13 patients with tropical sprue compared with three with irritable bowel syndrome. The most commonly isolated bacteria in tropical sprue were Gram-negative aerobic bacilli.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a bacteriologic study from Puerto Rico, small bowel aspirates from patients with tropical sprue had a higher mean colony count of <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, </em>and <em>Escherichia coli</em> compared to Puerto Rican and American controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These organisms produced enterotoxins in culture that caused fluid secretion in the rabbit ileal loop model.</p><p/><p>No specific causative infectious agent has been isolated from patients with tropical sprue. Many of the bacteriologic studies conducted in the tropics are confounded by the presence of significant growth of coliform bacteria in the small bowel of control patients. Furthermore, studies of diarrheal diseases in India and other subtropical developing countries are often difficult to interpret because few individuals pass formed stools, as is the expected norm in Western developed countries.</p><p>To further evaluate the role of various microorganisms in the pathogenesis of tropical sprue, further study with polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostic techniques is needed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347563171\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toxins and fermentation products produced by bacterial overgrowth can cause significant small bowel structural damage. In turn, the intestinal injury results in malabsorption of a variety of nutrients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malabsorption of dietary carbohydrates results from reduced levels of the disaccharidase enzymes &ndash; lactase, sucrase, and maltase.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired fat absorption in the proximal small bowel results from the loss of the normal villous architecture and causes steatorrhea.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Folate and vitamin B12 malabsorption lead to megaloblastic anemia. Fermentation products such as ethanol diminish folate absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It has been suggested that folate deficiency is predominant early in the disease, and that vitamin B12 malabsorption occurs as the structural abnormalities progress distally to involve the terminal ileum. Vitamin D deficiency (leading to hypophosphatemia and hypocalcemia) and hypomagnesemia are also common, and are thought to reflect impaired absorption across the damaged small bowel mucosa.</p><p/><p>In contrast with tropical sprue, folate deficiency does not result from chronic small bowel overgrowth or blind loop syndrome in patients from the United States. This may be related to a difference in the bacterial species colonizing the small bowel in the two conditions: facultative anaerobic, toxigenic coliforms in tropical sprue versus anaerobic nontoxigenic flora in small bowel overgrowth or blind loop syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine, the bacteria generate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a>, and serum folate concentrations are usually increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17963186\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tropical sprue should be strongly considered in patients with chronic diarrhea and nutrient malabsorption who have lived for more than one month in an area where tropical sprue exists. Diarrhea can first develop after a patient returns from the tropics.</p><p>Most patients have steatorrhea, typically in the range of 10 to 40 g of stool fat per day (normal less than 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span>. The chronic diarrhea is sometimes accompanied by cramps, gas, fatigue, and, with time, progressive weight loss. Auscultation of the abdomen may reveal hyperactive bowel sounds, and borborygmi is common.</p><p>Signs and symptoms of malabsorption are common, and include glossitis and cheilitis, protuberant abdomen, and pedal edema. </p><p>Patients may report fatigue and demonstrate pallor due to megaloblastic anemia. However, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord and other neurologic manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency have not been described in patients with tropical sprue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Similarly, tetany and carpopedal spasm, due to hypocalcemia and vitamin D deficiency, are rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25435265\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Megaloblastic anemia secondary to folate deficiency is maximal three to four months after disease onset, producing a hematocrit less than 30 and an elevated mean corpuscular volume. In the presence of longstanding vitamin B12 deficiency, pancytopenia may be present. Folate deficiency appears to be more common than B12 deficiency in India and Southeast Asia, whereas the reverse is true in the Caribbean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Other laboratory abnormalities, including hypoalbuminemia, are present in chronic, severe disease (due to malnutrition <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> protein-losing enteropathy), mild hypocalcemia, and vitamin D deficiency. The D-xylose absorption test, if available, is often abnormal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of malabsorption&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25435298\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiologic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiologic examinations of the small intestine in tropical sprue reveal nonspecific changes of dilation, thickening and edema of mucosal folds, and retention or secretion of fluid in the lumen which dilutes the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> column during its passage through the small intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. These changes are nonspecific and are also described in celiac disease, olmesartan-associated enteropathy, scleroderma, and hypoalbuminemia and anasarca of any etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25435305\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of tropical sprue includes other infections, celiac disease and other causes of malabsorption.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term &quot;tropical enteropathy&quot; has been proposed to describe structural abnormalities of the small intestine observed in residents of the tropics where tropical sprue is common, but without the typical symptoms of classic tropical sprue. The findings include shortened or blunted villi and mild lymphocytic infiltration, which may be accompanied by subclinical malabsorption of carbohydrates, fat, and vitamin B12. These changes are thought to arise from low-grade infection of the small bowel with bacteria acquired from contaminated food and water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections with Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, Strongyloides stercoralis, Cryptosporidium parvum, Isospora belli, and Cyclospora cayetanensis may mimic tropical sprue. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intestinal lymphoma can mimic tropical sprue and celiac disease, and occasionally coexists with the latter disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-primary-gastrointestinal-lymphomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of primary gastrointestinal lymphomas&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AIDS, with or without intestinal opportunistic infections, should be considered in patients with known HIV risk factors. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malabsorption secondary to intestinal scleroderma, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, and blind loop syndrome should be excluded. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal manifestations of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Celiac disease (gluten sensitive enteropathy) can be distinguished from tropical sprue by testing for serum IgA antibody to tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG). Patients with tropical sprue do not have antibodies to tissue transglutaminase or anti-endomysial antibodies that are found in patients with celiac disease. In some cases, overlap between these entities may require genotyping for HLA DQ-2 and DQ-8. HLA-DQ-2 or DQ-8 are present in almost all patients with celiac disease, and thus their absence would exclude celiac disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tropical pancreatitis is a form of idiopathic chronic pancreatitis of the Indian subcontinent and Africa which may produce malabsorption, diarrhea, and wasting that mimic tropical sprue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-chronic-pancreatitis-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Tropical pancreatitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic possibilities in patients with diarrhea acquired in the tropics are quite extensive since a large number of infectious and inflammatory diarrheas can mimic tropical sprue (see <a href=\"#H25435305\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above). Therefore, exclusion of these causes of diarrhea is necessary to establish a diagnosis in patients with a clinical presentation that is suggestive of tropical sprue. Stool tests and serologic studies can help exclude other causes of diarrhea. If these are negative, upper endoscopy with biopsy of the small bowel should be performed. However, small bowel biopsy findings in sprue are supportive of the diagnosis, but not diagnostic of tropical sprue. The diagnosis of tropical sprue is ultimately confirmed by a response to treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25435387\"><span class=\"h2\">Stool tests and serology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Careful stool and serologic testing may be required to exclude infection with <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em>, <em>Giardia lamblia</em>, <em>Strongyloides stercoralis</em>, <em>Cryptosporidium parvum</em>, <em>Isospora belli</em>, and <em>Cyclospora cayetanensis</em>. (See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p>Serologic tests should be performed to rule out celiac sprue.

Gross findings at endoscopy include flattening of duodenal folds and &quot;scalloping.&quot; The latter finding was originally thought to be pathognomonic of celiac disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65969\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65969 \">picture 1</a>), but also occurs in tropical sprue and other small bowel infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>The main histologic features are shortened, blunted villi and elongated crypts with increased inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils in the lamina propria, although these features are not specific to tropical sprue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Early in the illness, these morphologic changes are most pronounced in the upper small intestine but, with time, the ileum becomes involved, although usually not as severely as the duodenum and jejunum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In celiac disease, blunting of the villi is more severe with complete or nearly complete absence of villi, producing a flat mucosa free of any villous protrusions. Villous atrophy also occurs in other small bowel diseases, including AIDS enteropathy, parasitic infections with <em>Giardia lamblia</em> or <em>Cryptosporidium parvum</em>, Whipple's disease, small bowel bacterial overgrowth or stasis syndrome, and intestinal lymphoma. Specific histologic diagnosis of these conditions requires identification of infectious microorganisms, malignant lymphocytes, or other specific diagnostic features absent in patients with tropical sprue. (See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While spontaneous recovery from mild tropical sprue may occur, most authorities recommend treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> (250 mg PO four times daily) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> for three to six months. Even on this regimen, relapses or reinfection occur in up to 20 percent of patients living in the tropics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> replacement alone effectively reverses most of the signs and symptoms of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Within several weeks, most patients treated with pharmacologic doses of folic acid (1 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> show improvement in megaloblastic anemia, weight gain, and an increased sense of well being. This dramatic symptomatic response to oral folate therapy is observed so frequently in tropical sprue and so rarely (if ever) in other forms of small bowel disease with megaloblastic anemia that it is considered to be diagnostic of the illness. Folate therapy also corrects many of the morphologic abnormalities in the small intestine, suggesting that the etiology of the villous atrophy in tropical sprue is related in part to folate deficiency. </p><p>Patients with coexistent vitamin B12 deficiency may require intramuscular injection of 1000 &micro;g of vitamin B12 weekly to achieve complete reversal of megaloblastic anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Despite the favorable initial response to folate therapy, clinical and morphologic abnormalities of the intestine persist in 50 percent of patients treated with folate alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. The administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> for three to six months completely reverses the intestinal and hematologic abnormalities of tropical sprue in a majority of patients. The duration of therapy should be based on normalization of hemoglobin levels and improvement in steatorrhea and diarrhea. An alternative to tetracycline for patients who cannot take tetracycline (pregnant women, children, or those with allergy to tetracycline) is one of the poorly absorbable sulfonamide drugs (sulphaguanidine, succinylsulfathiazole, phthalylsulfacetamide or phthalylsulfathiazole) for six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tropical-sprue/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25435193\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tropical sprue is a chronic diarrheal disease, possibly of infectious origin, that involves the small intestine and is characterized by malabsorption of nutrients, especially <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> and vitamin B12.
