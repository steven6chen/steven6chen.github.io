An overview of salicylate intoxication in children and adolescents will be presented here. General issues relating to the clinical management of drug intoxication are presented separately.

The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a> (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA) in children has declined since it was associated with Reye syndrome. The incidence of unintentional salicylate intoxication among toddlers also has declined with limitation of the dose of aspirin in chewable, flavored tablets (to 81 mg), restriction of the number of tablets per bottle (to 36), and child-resistant packaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Among children there are approximately 20,000 salicylate exposures reported to United States regional poison control centers annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Deaths from exploratory salicylate overdose in children are rare. Most pediatric cases of severe salicylate poisoning or death occur among adolescents with intentional ingestion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75205245\"><span class=\"h1\">FORMULATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Aspirin</a> (acetylsalicylic acid) is available in chewable form, regular tablets, and enteric-coated pills. Other salicylates, such as salicylic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bismuth-subsalicylate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">bismuth subsalicylate</a>, and methyl salicylate, can cause intoxication when ingested or absorbed through the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Salicylic acid is a topical keratolytic agent and wart remover. Bismuth salicylate is a common ingredient in over-the-counter antidiarrheal agents (eg, Pepto-Bismol, Kaopectate). Magnesium subsalicylate in combination with caffeine, a combination product known as Diurex, is used as an &ldquo;antibloat&rdquo; medicine, but has been reported to cause salicylate toxicity in overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Methyl salicylate (oil of wintergreen) is a common ingredient of Chinese herbal medications as well as liniments and ointments used in the management of musculoskeletal pain; it also is used as a flavoring agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. One teaspoon (5 mL) of oil of wintergreen contains approximately 7 g of salicylate, the equivalent of 22 adult aspirin tablets; ingestion of just 4 mL can be fatal in a child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The methyl salicylate concentration and the bioavailability of salicylate in methyl salicylate creams vary by preparation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOKINETICS AND TOXICOKINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After ingestion, salicylate is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, primarily from the jejunum and to a lesser extent, from the stomach and duodenum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The type of formulation (eg, liquid, effervescent, extended-release, enteric-coated) affects the degree of absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p>With therapeutic dosing of regular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a> tablets, peak plasma concentrations are usually achieved 15 to 60 minutes after ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Peak concentrations in overdose may be delayed as a result of pylorospasm or bezoar formation. Peak concentrations following ingestion of extended-release or enteric-coated preparations typically occur between 4 and 14 hours after ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>].</p><p>In therapeutic dosing, 80 to 90 percent of salicylate is protein-bound (primarily to albumin), and remains in the vascular space. However, in overdose, saturation of protein-binding sites leads to an increase in the free fraction of salicylate in the plasma, and increased drug reaching the tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Salicylate is metabolized via several routes in the liver. In therapeutic dosing, the metabolism of salicylate, which involves glucuronidation, oxidation, and glycine conjugation, is described by first-order kinetics (where the rate is proportional to the dose) with a half-life of 15 to 20 minutes. At increasing doses, salicylate saturates these enzyme systems, and elimination of the drug undergoes a transition to zero-order kinetics (where a fixed amount of drug is metabolized per unit of time [Michaelis-Menten kinetics]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Thus, at increased doses, the half-life of salicylate is greatly increased and may be up to 30 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In addition, with increasing doses, a greater-than-expected increase in serum and tissue concentration occurs; for children on chronic therapy, even a slight change in dose may result in a great increase in plasma concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Salicylic acid (HS) is a weak acid that exists in a charged (deprotonated, sal-) and uncharged (protonated, H+) form:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;H+ &#160; + &#160; sal- &#160; &#160;&lt;&mdash;&gt; &#160; &#160; HS</p></div></div><p>Uncharged molecules (HS), unlike charged molecules (sal-), can move easily across cellular barriers, including the blood-brain barrier and the epithelium of the renal tubule. Metabolic acidosis drives the above reaction to the right and increases the plasma concentration of HS, thereby promoting diffusion across the blood-brain barrier into the CNS. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>Treatment of salicylate intoxication is directed toward increasing systemic pH via the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium bicarbonate</a>. By driving the above reaction to the left, salicylate anions are &quot;trapped&quot; in the blood. Alkalinization also &quot;traps&quot; salicylate anions within the renal tubule, preventing back-diffusion across the renal epithelium into the systemic circulation.</p><p>An alkaline environment protects the patient from detrimental tissue toxicity, especially in the central nervous system. To appreciate how alkalinization acts, it is important to note that salicylic acid is a weak acid with a pKa of 3.0. Thus, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the reaction above can be expressed as:</p><p>pH &#160; = &#160; 3.0 &#160; + &#160;log [sal -] <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> [HS]</p><p>At the normal extracellular pH of 7.40, the ratio of deprotonated (charged) salicylic acid to protonated (uncharged) salicylate is about 25,000:1; that is, only 0.004 percent of the total extracellular salicylate exists in protonated form. Salicylic acid is nonpolar, lipid-soluble, and able to cross cell membranes; deprotonated salicylate is polar and crosses membranes poorly. As a result, the plasma and central nervous system (CNS) salicylic acid concentrations are in diffusion equilibrium, but not the ionized salicylate concentrations.</p><p>If the systemic pH is increased, plasma salicylic acid concentration will fall and cause diffusion of salicylic acid out of the CNS and other tissues into the extracellular fluid down a favorable concentration gradient where it will be trapped as ionized salicylate. The fall in the CNS salicylic acid concentration then causes the first equation to move to the right in the brain cell. This increase in the cellular HS concentration promotes further drug movement out of the CNS.</p><p>Increasing the arterial pH from 7.20 to 7.50 will decrease the fractional concentration of HS from 0.006 to 0.003 percent. Although this change appears trivial, it will promote a significant reduction in the tissue salicylate concentration. This will be accompanied by an initial increment in the plasma salicylate concentration, but it is the tissue levels that are dangerous to the patient.</p><p>Concurrent alkalinization of the urine is also beneficial by increasing salicylate excretion. Since the salicylate anion is highly protein-bound, it enters the urine primarily via secretion by the organic anion secretory pathway in the proximal tubule, rather than by glomerular filtration. Alkalinization of the urine converts urinary salicylic acid to ionized salicylate thereby minimizing the back-diffusion of secreted salicylic acid out of the tubular lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. As an example, raising the urine pH from 6.5 to 8.1 by the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium bicarbonate</a> can increase total salicylate excretion more than fivefold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Maintaining a high-urine flow rate with hydration further enhances this process.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Salicylate has multiple cellular and systemic effects that define its clinical presentation in overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,23,24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation of the respiratory center of the medulla results in increased respiratory rate, respiratory alkalosis, increased renal elimination of HCO<sub>3</sub>, and increased insensible fluid loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interference with cellular metabolism (uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation) leads to metabolic acidosis, hyperpyrexia, fluid loss, and hypoglycemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle leads to metabolic acidosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibition of cyclooxygenase results in decreased synthesis of prostaglandins, prostacyclin, and thromboxanes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stimulation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the medulla causes nausea and vomiting.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmarks of acute salicylate overdose are hyperpnea, tachypnea, metabolic acidosis, and to a lesser extent, tachycardia. Early symptoms include tinnitus, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; more severe intoxication can cause fever, altered mental status, coma, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and death. Salicylate toxicity is associated with several clinical and laboratory findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74079\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74079 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Salicylate intoxication, known as salicylism, may be acute, chronic, or acute-on-chronic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Chronic and acute-on-chronic toxicity are uncommon in children, since <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">aspirin</a> is rarely used on a daily basis in children. The discussion below will focus on acute salicylate toxicity. However, it should be noted that chronic or therapeutic (repeated dose) salicylate poisonings in children usually are more serious and involve more severe clinical manifestations than acute ingestions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations of salicylate ingestion are dependent, to some extent, upon the ingested dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As a general rule, ingestions of less than 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> are associated with mild symptoms, ingestions of 300 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> are associated with moderate toxicity, and ingestions of &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> are associated with death. Fatal salicylate intoxication can occur after the ingestion of 10 to 30 g by adults and as little as 3 g by children. Death typically results from severe central nervous system (CNS) toxicity with complete loss of function of the cardiorespiratory centers.</p><p>Although there is no absolute correlation between the plasma salicylate concentration and symptoms, most patients show signs of intoxication when the plasma concentration exceeds 30 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (300 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L,</span> 2.2 to 3.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L);</span> the usual therapeutic range is 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L,</span> 0.7 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The clinician should take care in reading and interpreting laboratory reports since some laboratories report salicylate levels as <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L,</span> rather than <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL;</span> such values will be 10-fold higher than those discussed in this topic review. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Salicylate poisoning leads to a variety of clinical features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vital signs</strong> &ndash; Salicylate intoxication can lead to increased respiratory rate, temperature, and heart rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Salicylates stimulate the medullary respiratory center, causing tachypnea and hyperventilation. The respiratory rate must be carefully monitored in all patients with suspected salicylate overdose. Salicylate-intoxicated patients have a dramatic increase in minute ventilation. The rate and depth of breathing provide critical clues to salicylate toxicity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Salicylates uncouple oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria; this generates heat and may increase body temperature. A lack of hyperthermia, however, should not be used to exclude the diagnosis of salicylate toxicity. Hypovolemia further limits the ability to dissipate heat. Children are able to tolerate hyperpyrexia somewhat better than adults, in whom hyperpyrexia suggests a grave prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Salicylate ingestion can cause tachycardia due to hypovolemia, agitation, or general distress.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tinnitus</strong> &ndash; Salicylates commonly cause tinnitus, and may do so at levels within the therapeutic range (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>. This specific symptom should be sought in all patients with potential salicylate toxicity. As CNS salicylate concentration increases, diminished auditory acuity may ensue, sometimes leading to deafness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nausea and vomiting</strong> &ndash; Salicylate can cause nausea and vomiting through multiple mechanisms. These include direct stimulation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone in the medulla, delayed gastric emptying, direct irritation of the gastric mucosa, and decreased production of prostaglandins (leading to deterioration of the protective mucosal barrier).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary edema</strong> &ndash; Salicylate-induced noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is more common among older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] but does occur in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In one five-year retrospective review of 20 cases of pediatric salicylate poisoning, two children developed pulmonary edema; both children died, while there were no deaths among the 18 without pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Pulmonary edema may occur in the setting of falling or near-therapeutic plasma salicylate concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noncardiogenic-pulmonary-edema#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema&quot;, section on 'Salicylate toxicity'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hypoxia is the major clinical manifestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], although crackles may be present. In addition, arterial blood gas analysis may demonstrate a widened arterial-alveolar gradient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A chest radiograph should be obtained in children with salicylism in whom pulmonary edema is suspected. Radiographic signs of pulmonary edema, which may or may not be present, include pleural effusion, interstitial edema, fluid in the fissures, and septal lymphatic distension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Salicylate-induced pulmonary edema can complicate volume resuscitation and the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium bicarbonate</a>, two mainstays of treatment. Thus, pulmonary edema is an absolute indication for hemodialysis (see <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Hemodialysis'</a> below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Central nervous system abnormalities</strong> &ndash; CNS toxicity, suggestive of severe poisoning, may occur in the setting of falling or near-therapeutic plasma salicylate concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The development of acidemia increases the risk of CNS toxicity since salicylate, a neutral compound at acidic pH, is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the CNS (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">CNS toxicity is more common among children younger than five years of age than among older children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,32</a>]. CNS toxicity manifests as agitation, confusion, restlessness, seizures, and rarely, coma. Seizures are a more common presentation among children with chronic ingestions and severe metabolic acidosis than among children with acute ingestions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The development of CNS toxicity is an indication for hemodialysis, regardless of the plasma salicylate concentration (see <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Hemodialysis'</a> below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acid-base derangement</strong> &ndash; A variety of acid-base disturbances can occur with salicylate intoxication. The typical abnormality is a primary respiratory alkalosis with a primary metabolic acidosis. Salicylates stimulate the respiratory center directly, leading to hyperpnea. This results in a decreased PCO2 and respiratory alkalosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,32,33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and mixed acid-base disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The increase in respiratory rate is critical to survival since alkalosis prevents CNS toxicity, which is the major cause of death. The respiratory alkalosis, which normally promotes lactic acid production to minimize the rise in pH, appears to play a contributory role in the development of metabolic acidosis. In experimental animals, lactate accumulation is minimal if the initial fall in PCO<sub>2</sub> is prevented, but gradually becomes more prominent as hypocapnia is permitted to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Salicylic acid itself (mol wt 180) has only a minor effect on serum pH, since a plasma level of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> represents a concentration that is less than 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. Thus, the metabolic acidosis following salicylate poisoning is due primarily to the accumulation of organic acids, including lactic acid and ketoacids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. Inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle by salicylates also contributes to the development of metabolic acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-metabolic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with metabolic acidosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Metabolic acidosis increases the concentration of uncharged salicylic acid, thereby promoting diffusion across the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The net effect of these changes in most adults is respiratory alkalosis or a mixed respiratory alkalosis-metabolic acidosis. Pure metabolic acidosis is unusual in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], but is more common in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Children with mild to moderate acute salicylate poisoning lose the respiratory drive and are more likely to present with mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/24,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and mixed acid-base disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Acute respiratory acidosis may also occur in adolescents and adults who ingest respiratory depressants at the same time as salicylate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Ingestion of respiratory depressants decreases the respiratory drive, leading to increased PaCO<sub>2</sub> and decreased plasma pH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and mixed acid-base disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fluids, electrolytes, and glucose</strong> &ndash; Fluid and electrolyte abnormalities are common in salicylate poisoning.

Alkalinization &quot;traps&quot; salicylate anions in the blood, since charged molecules do not easily diffuse across the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system (CNS). Alkalinization also &quot;traps&quot; salicylate anions within the renal tubule, preventing back-diffusion across the renal epithelium into the systemic circulation. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics'</a> above.)</p><p>Children and adolescents with significant salicylate toxicity should be managed in consultation with the toxicology service or advice from a regional poison control center. In the United States, call 1-800-222-1222 or access the World Health Organization's list of international poison centers (<a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/index.html&amp;token=vYXClxsD0hnrf4M8kYcoD1kMICrGjKQRRaFc8pA0pw9qlhpVmsmYh2e3Gi7webw9H9uSzH3nipQ0rPpTLYBWhGP+/wpQqUegRzvggwgKA6s=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6508\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/index.html</a>).

As noted above, the resulting respiratory alkalosis &quot;traps&quot; salicylate anions in the blood, preventing them from crossing into the CNS.</p><p>When intubation is necessary due to obtundation, hypotension, hypoventilation, or severe metabolic acidosis, care must be taken to ensure appropriately high-minute ventilation and maintain alkalemia with serum pH 7.45 to 7.55. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Urine alkalinization'</a> below.)</p><p>Importantly, mechanical ventilation is generally incapable of delivering such high-minute ventilation, and ventilator asynchrony may actually <strong>decrease</strong> the patient's ability to maintain appropriate acid-base homeostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. As minute ventilation falls following intubation, increased CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations worsen acidosis.
