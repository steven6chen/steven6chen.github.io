As a result, the prevalence of obesity-related comorbid conditions complicating pregnancy is also increasing. One of these conditions is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which refers to apneas and hypopneas (absent or severely reduced airflow) during sleep despite respiratory effort. OSA is characterized by repetitive episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep. The obstruction results in a reduction of airflow, hypoxemia, sympathetic discharge, and recurrent arousals from sleep. Central sleep apnea, which will not be reviewed here, is a different disorder that is defined by episodes of cessation of airflow due to absent breathing effort. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polysomnography-in-the-evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polysomnography in the evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While the diagnosis and management of OSA are similar in pregnant and nonpregnant women, some aspects of the disorder are unique to pregnancy. This topic will discuss OSA in pregnancy. Despite the increase in studies addressing this topic, there remains a scarcity of studies that address treatment and long-term effects of OSA in pregnant women.</p><p>Detailed discussions of sleep related breathing disorders (eg, OSA, central sleep apnea) in nonpregnant individuals are available separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polysomnography-in-the-evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polysomnography in the evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473216504\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in pregnant women is not well defined, and depends on the method of ascertainment. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a small prospective cohort study of 105 pregnant women who underwent first and third trimester in laboratory polysomnography, the prevalence of OSA (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] &ge;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">events/hour</span> of sleep) in the first and third trimesters was 10.5 and 26.7 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Of note, the subjects were not representative of the general obstetrical population, but were selected to provide a similar number of women in each of four body mass index (BMI) groups (normal &lt;25.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m2,</span> overweight 25.0 to &lt;30.0, class I obesity 30.0 to &lt;35.0, class II to III obesity &ge;35.0). Using data on the BMI distribution in their local clinical population, the authors estimated overall OSA prevalence to be 8.4 percent in the first trimester and 19.7 percent in the third trimester. Among the 28 women with OSA in the third trimester, the disorder was mild (AHI 5 to 14) in 23 women, moderate (AHI 15 to 29) in four women and severe (AHI &ge;30) in one woman. The prevalence of OSA in this study is higher than that reported in the nonpregnant population of reproductive age women, where the prevalence of OSA has been estimated to be 0.7 to 6.5 percent by various diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The single largest prospective study included a subset of participants in the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study Monitoring Mothers-to-be (NuMom2b) cohort who underwent level 3 home sleep apnea tests in early pregnancy (between 6 and 15 weeks of gestation) and in midpregnancy (between 22 and 31 weeks of gestation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Although the role of airway narrowing in OSA has not been studied in pregnancy, there is a significant link between OSA and the internal size of the airway in the general population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasal patency is reduced during pregnancy secondary to hyperemia and edema of the nasal mucosa. Changes in the nasal mucosa may be due to increased blood flow and variations in circulating levels of estrogen and progesterone. The increased nasal congestion may lead to increased upper airway resistance and more negative intra-pharyngeal pressure with inspiration, in turn predisposing women in late pregnancy to airway narrowing, and possibly snoring and obstructed breathing in sleep. Pregnant women are more likely to report snoring compared to their nonpregnant counterparts, and the prevalence of frequent snoring (&ge;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">nights/week)</span> increases during pregnancy from the first to the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>], as estrogen and progesterone levels increase. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in upper airway patency from other etiologies may also predispose pregnant women to snoring and possibly sleep disordered breathing. In healthy non-pregnant individuals, studies have shown that fluid displacement from the legs into the neck reduces upper airway size and increases upper airway collapsibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Fluid shifts induced by prolonged sitting and recumbency have been strongly related to the degree of sleep-disordered breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], although other data have found that such rostral fluid shifts do not increase the frequency of obstructed breathing events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Given that maternal blood volume increases, on average, 40 to 45 percent during pregnancy above nonpregnant levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], recumbency may adversely affect upper airway function and possibly increase the likelihood of sleep-disordered breathing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increase in progesterone levels during pregnancy leads to increased tidal volume and results in increased minute ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], either due to direct effects on respiratory drive or enhanced sensitivity of the brain&rsquo;s respiratory center to carbon dioxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Increased ventilatory drive during pregnancy may enhance loop gain and this may predispose to OSA.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473216532\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The general clinical manifestations and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>A gender disparity in the recognition and treatment of OSA has been recognized. While initial reports of OSA suggested eight or nine cases of sleep apnea in men for each case of sleep apnea in women, epidemiological studies report a ratio of two to four affected men for each affected woman [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Studies consistently show that women are more likely to be misdiagnosed or diagnosed with OSA at later stages than are men. Although women can have the same classic symptoms described in men (witnessed apnea, choking, and restless sleep), women appear to be less likely to self-report these symptoms, leading to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, women are more likely to report other symptoms as noted in a community-based sample of 551 men and 388 women, in which women were more likely than men to report daytime fatigue (60.8 versus 49.1 percent), morning headaches (12.5 versus 3.3 percent), and symptoms of depression (6.6 versus 2.7 percent), regardless of the severity of OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>The difficulty in identifying abnormal sleep symptoms in pregnant women in particular is compounded by the accepted belief that poor sleep is to be expected during pregnancy. Sleepiness and increased sleep need are widely reported by pregnant women, especially during the first trimester, and may occur due to increasing progesterone levels. These physiologic changes make it difficult to know what degree of increased sleepiness may be normal in pregnancy. Nevertheless, in one cross-sectional survey of patients and obstetric providers, 32 percent of women reported snoring but only 5 percent were asked about snoring by their provider [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473216547\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening questionnaires, which are inexpensive and easy to administer, are poorly predictive in women and their weaknesses may be even more prominent in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. In the largest cohort of pregnant women who completed Berlin questionnaires and underwent overnight polysomnography, the sensitivity and specificity of the Berlin questionnaire for identifying OSA were only 35 and 63 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In our patient population, we do not use screening questionnaires because of their poor performance. Individuals with obesity-related comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension are considered high risk. If they report snoring, witnessed apneas <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> drowsy driving, they are referred for evaluation by a sleep medicine specialist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473216554\"><span class=\"h2\">Objective testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no studies that specifically address the best method for objective OSA diagnosis in pregnant women. The gold standard for OSA diagnosis is the full-night, attended, in-laboratory polysomnogram. While unattended, home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) is a reasonable alternative for patients in whom there is a high likelihood of moderate or severe OSA, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guideline for the use of HSAT appears to exclude pregnant women from that category [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This guideline recommended that HSAT be used only in populations with substantive data on sensitivity and specificity; such data are not available for pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The guideline also excluded individuals with comorbid medical or sleep conditions as candidates for HSAT, which may include pregnancy. Nevertheless, increased risk for adverse outcomes among women with gestational OSA was observed in the nuMOM2b study using HSAT to identify mothers with OSA, suggesting that this methodology may be sufficiently sensitive to identify clinically significant cases of OSA in pregnant women.</p><p>In our practice, we do not use HSAT for diagnosing sleep disorders in pregnant women because of the paucity of data on validity and reliability in this population. All pregnant individuals with suspected sleep abnormalities should be referred to a sleep medicine specialist for evaluation and testing with an in laboratory overnight polysomnogram.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473216561\"><span class=\"h2\">Scoring severity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OSA severity is scored as mild, moderate, or severe, corresponding to an apnea hypopnea index (AHI, average number of apneas plus hypopneas per hour slept) of 5 to 15, 15 to 30, and &gt;30 events per hour, respectively (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>). The scoring of individual hypopneic and apneic events is dependent on the scoring criteria used in individual laboratories. The 2017 AASM-recommended criteria for identifying a hypopnea event are &ge;30 percent reduction in nasal pressure signal excursion from baseline lasting &ge;10 seconds, with an associated &ge;3 percent oxygen desaturation from pre-event baseline or an associated arousal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The AASM alternative scoring criteria for a hypopnea event are &ge;30 percent reduction in nasal pressure signal excursion or alternative hypopnea sensor lasting &ge;10 seconds with an associated &ge;4 percent oxygen desaturation.

Some of the physiological changes in pregnancy may contribute to the same symptoms as obstructive sleep apnea, such as frequent arousals and daytime sleepiness. Pregnancy-related causes of maternal awakening and arousal may be due to fetal movement, urination urge, nocturnal dyspepsia, or leg cramps. All of these symptoms are common in late pregnancy and contribute to sleep fragmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/2,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18</a>].

In the meantime, the significance of OSA to maternal and fetal health during the short course of pregnancy is becoming clearer.

This raises the issue of whether other manifestations of sleep-disordered breathing, such as snoring and flow limitation, are important. </p><p>Several observational studies on snoring in pregnant women have reached differing conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/27,28,31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28,31-34</a>].

The population-based data set lacked body mass index (BMI) data, resulting in a reported obesity rate of only 1.6 percent; therefore, whether risk conferred by OSA was independent of obesity could not be ascertained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>The association between OSA and hypertension has been hypothesized to be a physiological response to intermittent nocturnal hypoxia, which activates the sympathetic nervous system. The recurrent hypoxia and reoxygenation cycles also result in oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and increased oxidative vascular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. This is believed to be part of the mechanism underlying the development of preeclampsia, as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], providing a plausible common pathway for the development of early preeclampsia among women with OSA.</p><p>Data on the clinical course of OSA in the general population also lend support. In two large cohort studies, individuals with untreated OSA were more likely to develop hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. This association persisted after controlling for confounding variables such as body mass index, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. However, no studies have associated either presence or severity of sleep-related hypoxemia with any pregnancy outcome.</p><p>The use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the first-line therapy for obstructive sleep apnea, for treating the hypertensive conditions of pregnancy was examined in a small, uncontrolled study. When auto-titrating nasal CPAP was administered to 11 women with severe preeclampsia, mean nocturnal blood pressure was reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Independent of other risk factors, individuals with OSA have an increased risk of developing type II diabetes, hyperinsulinemia, and metabolic syndrome. While a causal link has not been proven, improved glucose control has been observed after initiating treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. </p><p>A 2013 systematic review of observational studies noted that pregnant women with sleep disordered breathing were at increased risk of developing gestational diabetes (adjusted OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.30-2.42; five studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. The presence of sleep disordered breathing was based on data obtained from questionnaires (four studies) or polysomnography (one study).

After controlling for confounding variables, gestational diabetes mellitus was associated with OSA in early pregnancy (OR 3.47; 95% CI 1.95-6.19) or midpregnancy (OR 2.79; 95% CI 1.63-4.77).</p><p>An increased risk of gestational diabetes in OSA patients is plausible since increasing insulin resistance occurs in both pregnancy and OSA.

However, 70 percent of the women still had the disorder up to three months postpartum. This study did not account for possible body position effects on the degree of sleep disordered breathing, postpartum weight loss, and changes in body fat composition and distribution, all of which possibly contributed to these findings. No larger scale longitudinal studies have assessed sleep-related breathing disorder in pregnancy using objective measures.

There are no pregnancy-specific guidelines for OSA treatment, no data on which to base fetal or maternal parameters for treatment, and no evidence that treatment in the short term impacts maternal or neonatal morbidity. In the absence of scientific evidence, clinicians have used their own protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>] or followed the published recommendations for treatment in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>]. In our practice, we treat all pregnant women with moderate or severe OSA by apnea hypopnea index (AHI) criteria. In the general population, therapies for OSA include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), oral appliances, upper airway surgery, and behavior modification. The indications for treatment and these treatments are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H348918127\"><span class=\"h3\">Pharmacologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No pharmacologic agent prevents or overcomes upper airway obstruction well enough to justify pharmacologic therapy as a primary therapy in the routine management of patients with OSA. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Modafinil</a> has been used to treat the sleepiness (not the apnea) associated with OSA. It is generally prescribed only for patients with OSA who experience problematic residual hypersomnolence despite adequate usual total sleep time and effectively treated OSA (eg, who are adherent to CPAP therapy). Women with OSA who become pregnant while being treated with modafinil or similar stimulants should be counseled about the paucity of safety data in pregnancy. Listed as an FDA category C, some animal studies have demonstrated embryotoxicity in the absence of maternal toxicity. According to the manufacturer, there were no reported adverse effects in seven human births reported after exposure to modafinil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. There are no data on excretion of modafinil in human milk. For these reasons, we recommend stopping modafinil during pregnancy and lactation. When discontinued, patients should be warned about increased sleepiness and should take appropriate precautions, such as when driving. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-residual-sleepiness-in-obstructive-sleep-apnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of residual sleepiness in obstructive sleep apnea&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H348918134\"><span class=\"h3\">CPAP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CPAP is generally regarded as first-line therapy for pregnant women with OSA, similar to the general population. We recommend in-laboratory polysomnography for the initial titration of CPAP, if the study (eg, a single-night split baseline and CPAP titration study, or a titration study performed within a few days of a full-night baseline polysomnography) and subsequent ordering of CPAP therapy can be done expeditiously. In-laboratory CPAP titration allows patients&rsquo; initial experience with CPAP to occur in a monitored setting so that questions and problems (such as CPAP mask leaks) can be addressed in real-time. Following an in-laboratory CPAP titration study, fixed-pressure CPAP therapy is an option; providers should recognize, however, that the therapeutic CPAP pressure may need to be increased over the course of pregnancy according to patient symptoms (eg, snoring while using CPAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>], as a prior study examining this issue observed that an increase in CPAP pressure of 1 to 2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O was required among some women with OSA over the course of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. For this reason, we prefer prescribing auto-titrating CPAP for treatment of OSA during pregnancy, using the results of the CPAP titration study as a guide to the range of pressures to be prescribed. When in-laboratory CPAP titration cannot be obtained quickly, auto-titrating CPAP therapy can be initiated empirically without an additional sleep study. In either case, follow-up should occur within one to two weeks after initiation of CPAP therapy and regularly thereafter (eg, every one to three months during pregnancy) so that adherence to and efficacy of CPAP treatment can be assessed and adjusted as needed.</p><p>The safety of CPAP therapy in pregnancy has not been systematically studied, but case reports have not described adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/18,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,68</a>]. In the general population, the most common side effects of CPAP use include rhinitis, skin abrasions, mouth dryness and aerophagia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. These complaints are echoed by pregnant patients in our clinics. One theoretical concern of nasal CPAP is the potential for decreased cardiac output due to the applied positive intrathoracic pressure. A study of 24 women with severe preeclampsia observed that their cardiac output decreased during sleep (from 7.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> to 5.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min),</span> but remained at baseline when the women were treated with CPAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. These data may not apply to pregnant women with OSA who are not preeclamptic.</p><p>It is estimated that only 50 percent of individuals are adherent to CPAP therapy, but rates of compliance in pregnancy have not been reported. In our pregnant population, we have found adherence rates that are similar to the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Pregnant patients in our clinics often cite nasal congestion and lack of symptomatic improvement as reasons for nonadherence.

However, only 35 to 40 percent of patients achieve a reduction in the degree of sleep-disordered breathing to normal levels (ie, AHI &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">events/hour),</span> and oxyhemoglobin saturation levels often do not return to normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. This latter point is an important consideration, given the potential for fetal hypoxemia among pregnant women with OSA. Furthermore, the multiple fittings that can be needed to initiate oral appliance use and the potential need for frequent refitting due to the potentially rapid weight gain of pregnancy are likely to make this treatment impractical for pregnant women. No mandibular repositioning device data exist in pregnant women with OSA.

This is particularly important if the patient has not been evaluated in the previous six months or is not being treated. Their provider can assess symptoms and evaluate the need for a CPAP titration or, in some cases, repeat polysomnography. These individuals may be at risk for developing pregnancy related hypertensive disease, so blood pressure and urine protein should be monitored closely. Given the high risk of underlying diabetes in individuals with OSA, we suggest early testing for gestational diabetes. In our practice, we perform an early glucose-tolerance test. If it is normal, it is repeated at 24 to 28 weeks gestational age.

This provider can evaluate the patient and participate in her care throughout the pregnancy and after delivery. In the absence of pregnancy-specific data to direct treatment, we suggest treatment for all women with moderate or severe OSA. The goal of treatment is to normalize the AHI and to alleviate any nocturnal hypoxemia. Among pregnant women with mild OSA, usual indications for treatment of OSA (such as excessive daytime somnolence) can first be considered when deciding whether to recommend treatment. In addition, we believe that pregnant women with mild OSA should be treated if they have recurrent oxyhemoglobin desaturations to less than 90 percent, given the potential for adverse effects of hypoxemia on the fetus. Among otherwise asymptomatic pregnant women with mild OSA who develop adverse outcomes that have been associated with OSA (eg, the hypertensive diseases of pregnancy or gestational diabetes), a trial of CPAP therapy may be considered, but is not clearly indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13387300\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrapartum management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancies affected by OSA should be considered &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; pregnancies. Maternal risks include hypoxemia and morbidity from the comorbid conditions that often track with OSA. Many intrapartum issues related to OSA overlap with the risks of obesity (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-pregnancy-complications-and-maternal-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in pregnancy: Complications and maternal management&quot;</a>). Continuous pulse oximetry during labor and the postpartum period will help identify hypoxemia and help tailor further management. </p><p>Ideally, the anesthesia service is consulted prenatally, but at least early in the patient&rsquo;s labor. Early placement of regional anesthesia may prevent the need for general anesthesia if emergent cesarean delivery becomes necessary. General anesthesia has been associated with an increase in maternal morbidity and mortality, which is more profound in individuals with OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Regional anesthesia also avoids the potential need for opioids to manage labor pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-risk-and-the-preoperative-evaluation-and-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical risk and the preoperative evaluation and management of adults with obstructive sleep apnea&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Women who have been using CPAP, another positive pressure modality, or an oral appliance prior to delivery for OSA should be instructed to bring their devices when they present for delivery. Patients with OSA should have their oxygenation continuously monitored during labor with a pulse oximeter. If hypoxemia is observed, a comprehensive clinical evaluation should be performed to determine the etiology. The clinical evaluation should focus on respiratory causes of hypoxemia and, in particular, any potentially life-threatening causes such as pulmonary embolus. Pregnant women who are suspected of having OSA, or who are found to have OSA and are not on effective therapy, should be referred to a physician with expertise and experience in sleep medicine for possible intrapartum management and postpartum follow-up. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13387307\"><span class=\"h2\">Postpartum management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of opioids in individuals with sleep apnea is an area of significant concern.

This management is recommended for all women with diagnosed or suspected OSA. The use of CPAP in women with OSA in the postpartum period may be sufficient to treat the hypoxemia; however, the CPAP settings should be adjusted to assure normoxic values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The supine position worsens OSA in some patients.

Women diagnosed with OSA during pregnancy should have repeat testing, particularly after losing their pregnancy weight. At our institutions, we generally recommend that this evaluation take place 8 to 12 weeks after delivery. However, it is important to keep in mind that although up to 80 percent of gestational weight gain is usually lost within six weeks of delivery, weight loss can continue for several months postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-pregnancy/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Thus, postpartum management of sleep apnea needs to be individualized. In obese women, we recommend weight management strategies which, in addition to providing benefit with regard to OSA, will help in the management of their comorbid conditions and improve overall health before a subsequent pregnancy.</p><p>There are no data regarding the effect of an interval pregnancy on the natural history of OSA, or regarding whether the development of incident OSA during one pregnancy increases the risk for OSA in subsequent pregnancies.

(See <a href=\"#H473216532\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two potential effects of OSA on pregnancy include increased risks of developing preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. There are no clear adverse fetal effects, apart from sequelae from these pregnancy complications. (See <a href=\"#H473217381\" class=\"local\">'Effect of OSA on pregnancy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no pregnancy-specific guidelines for OSA treatment, no data on which to base fetal or maternal parameters for treatment, and no evidence that treatment in the short term impacts pregnancy outcome. In the general population, therapies for OSA include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), oral appliances, and behavior modification. The indications for treatment and these treatments are reviewed separately. Women with pregestational OSA should have an evaluation by a sleep provider for CPAP management during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H473217578\" class=\"local\">'Options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant women with OSA should be managed with a sleep medicine specialist. Intrapartum care should include an early consultation with the anesthesia service for placement of regional anesthesia and continuous pulse oximetry. Patients receiving opiates should be observed closely for respiratory suppression. (See <a href=\"#H13387300\" class=\"local\">'Intrapartum management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postpartum, an analgesic strategy that minimizes the need for systemic opioids and other drugs that suppress <span class=\"nowrap\">CNS/respiratory</span> function should be used.
