The occurrence of an extremely high number of cases of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) was noted early in the AIDS epidemic and many of them had an unusually aggressive clinical course. KS was therefore included as an AIDS-defining illness in early case definitions from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and invasive cervical carcinoma were subsequently added as AIDS-defining conditions.</p><p>Subsequently, the spectrum of neoplasia in HIV-infected patients has changed as the use of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) has become widespread (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74024\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74024 \">table 1</a>). The incidence of KS and NHL has decreased markedly, but there has been a relative increase in malignancies that collectively are referred to as non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs) compared with the general population. NADCs now are a major factor contributing to mortality in HIV-infected people.</p><p>This topic will review general management considerations for patients with HIV and a malignancy, as well as a discussion of specific malignancies. The epidemiology and pathogenesis of malignancy in people infected with HIV are discussed separately.

These features may have implications for screening and treatment, and may contribute to a poorer outcome, with rapid progression, a high rate of relapse, and a worse response to treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1560506118\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening and prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The increased incidence of selected cancers in HIV-infected patients, combined with the younger age of onset and the altered biology, raise the question of whether more aggressive screening is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-management-considerations/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Most cancer screening guidelines do not make separate recommendations for individuals infected with HIV, with the exception of the European AIDS Clinical Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-management-considerations/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Unfortunately, routine screening for cancer is less frequent in HIV-infected people than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-management-considerations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Clinicians caring for HIV-infected individuals should adhere to age-appropriate screening recommendations for the common malignancies and should actively encourage compliance with those guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-management-considerations/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. Providers should be aware of the new guidelines for lung cancer screening in those at increased risk because of significant smoking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite the absence of evidence supporting increased screening in this population, clinicians should be highly vigilant to symptoms suggestive of early disease. In addition to screening, clinicians caring for HIV-infected individuals should make every effort to help patients minimize risk factors for cancer. Potential opportunities include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking cessation programs (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus vaccination&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine and the treatment of hepatitis B infection (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus vaccination&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1560506125\"><span class=\"h2\">Principles of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of cancer in HIV-infected individuals follows the same general principles as for those not infected with HIV. The diagnosis of cancer should be confirmed pathologically. For patients with early-stage disease, initial management is with curative intent, as is the case for HIV-uninfected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-management-considerations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, cancer registry data suggest that patients with HIV infection are less likely to be treated for some malignancies, and this may adversely affect survival rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-management-considerations/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Systemic therapy may be required for metastatic disease or as adjuvant therapy. The use of cytotoxic chemotherapy with antiretroviral therapy (ART) may result in additive cytotoxicity or other drug-drug interactions and may further enhance immunosuppression. The combination of chemotherapy and ART requires a careful consideration of such potential interactions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-therapy-for-malignancy-in-patients-on-antiretroviral-medications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic therapy for malignancy in patients on antiretroviral medications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other factors that can complicate the management of malignancy in an HIV-infected individual include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV-infected patients frequently have significant comorbidities that result in a poor performance status and affect the response to treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of reactive lymphadenopathy or other imaging abnormalities not related to the malignancy may complicate accurate tumor staging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV-infected individuals may be poor surgical candidates because of an increased risk of developing postoperative infections, particularly in those with predominantly late stage AIDS. Data from patients with early-stage HIV disease found surgical risks were similar to those without HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-management-considerations/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p/><p>Patients with malignancy and HIV infection were excluded from most clinical trials with checkpoint inhibitors, as with other agents, because of concerns of exacerbating infections or causing immune-related toxicity. Although there are no clinical trials specifically in this population, case reports and small series suggest that these agents can be used with results similar to those seen in patients without HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-management-considerations/abstract/9-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of cancer immunotherapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxicities-associated-with-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxicities associated with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89074389\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with HIV infection and cancer may experience higher cancer-specific mortality compared with those who do not have HIV infection, independent of cancer stage or receipt of cancer treatment. The largest analysis of cancer-specific mortality is a retrospective review of over 1.8 million patients with cancer, of whom approximately 6500 were infected with HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-management-considerations/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. HIV infection was associated with increased cancer-specific mortality for several common non-AIDS-defining cancers: colorectum (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.49), pancreas (HR, 1.71), larynx (HR, 1.62), lung (HR, 1.28), melanoma (HR, 1.72), breast (HR, 2.61), and prostate (HR, 1.57).</p><p>The association between HIV infection and cancer-related mortality remained for colorectal, lung, melanoma, and breast cancer even after adjustment for non-receipt of cancer treatment.</p><p>Immunosuppression, as it relates to tolerance of cancer treatments and its role in promoting tumor progression, may play a role in the increased cancer-specific mortality observed in HIV-infected patients compared with HIV-uninfected patients. This serves as another potential rationale for early initiation of antiretroviral therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-to-initiate-antiretroviral-therapy-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;When to initiate antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H876173996\"><span class=\"h1\">LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE AND HEMATOLOGIC MALIGNANCIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1560506263\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-Hodgkin lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) in HIV-infected patients frequently arise in extranodal sites, such as the stomach or esophagus, and may constitute the majority of malignancies seen in those sites. The incidence of NHLs in HIV-infected patients has fallen markedly since the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Plasma cell disorders in HIV-infected patients tend to occur at a younger age than in the general population, with an average age of 33 years in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-management-considerations/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection may contribute to the development of monoclonal gammopathy in some HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-management-considerations/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can resolve monoclonal gammopathy for patients with HIV, particularly those without active hepatitis C coinfection. For example, in one retrospective study including over 1200 patients, 11 percent were found to have abnormal protein bands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-management-considerations/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Of 77 patients with abnormal bands who were included for further study, 66 percent experienced disappearance of the monoclonal peak at a median follow-up of 6.8 years. Multivariate analysis revealed that disappearance of the monoclonal peak was associated with HIV virologic control (odds ratio [OR] 6.0, 95% CI 1.6-21.9) and the absence of hepatitis C virus replication at the end of follow-up (OR 10.2, 95% CI 2.4-43.7). These results are in contrast to monoclonal gammopathy in patients who do not have HIV, for whom monoclonal protein typically does not resolve.

Multivariate analysis found that abnormalities in serum proteins were associated with a younger age, a higher HIV viral load, a more robust immune system (ie, higher CD4 cell count), and hepatitis B <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> C virus coinfection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-management-considerations/abstract/16,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,23</a>].</p><p>A subset of these patients go on to develop myeloma, plasmacytoma, or lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-management-considerations/abstract/16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18</a>]. Extramedullary disease is common in those patients who develop multiple myeloma; such plasmacytomas can be multiple and present in unusual anatomical locations. Plasma cell malignancies may show a plasmablastic morphology, making them difficult to differentiate from plasmablastic lymphoma. Myeloma patients with concomitant HIV infection may have an increased risk of complications, including intractable hypercalcemia, hyperviscosity, cytopenia, and renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-management-considerations/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>HIV-infected persons diagnosed with a plasma cell disorder should be treated similarly to HIV-uninfected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hiv-infection-and-malignancy-management-considerations/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Infection with HHV-8 precedes and is predictive of the development of KS (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-infection-and-malignancy-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H1560490920\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV infection and malignancy: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'HHV-8 infection'</a>). KS is primarily a disease of men; early in the HIV epidemic, KS was noted in 20 to 30 percent of HIV-infected men who have sex with men. With the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the incidence decreased dramatically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-infection-and-malignancy-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H1560489307\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV infection and malignancy: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>AIDS-related KS has a variable clinical course, ranging from an asymptomatic incidental finding to explosive growth resulting in significant morbidity and mortality.

Although there are no randomized trials evaluating the effect of ART, observational studies provide strong evidence that the natural history of KS has changed since its introduction; immune reconstitution due to control of the HIV infection is the most likely explanation for this altered prognosis. ART is recommended for virtually all patients with AIDS-related KS.

Locally directed therapy is often used to palliate symptoms caused by a specific tumor or to treat cosmetic disfigurement. Systemic therapy is used for more extensive disease, but injury to an immune system that is already severely compromised should be avoided whenever possible.</p><p>The approach to therapy and the integration of various treatment options is discussed separately.
