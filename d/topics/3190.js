These reactions are classified as type I reactions in the Gell and Coombs system of immunologic reactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80466\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80466 \">table 1</a>). Many immediate reactions involve urticaria or hives, which are intensely pruritic, erythematous, cutaneous plaques or papules. Urticarial lesions resolve over the course of hours without residual markings, and then reappear elsewhere (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72519\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72519 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F75230\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75230 \">picture 2</a>). When evaluating a drug reaction, the clinician should look for signs and symptoms of immediate reactions, such as urticaria, bronchospasm, or hypotension. Careful attention should be paid to the patient's skin, both at the time of evaluation and when recording the details of the reaction in the patient's medical record, since accurate and detailed information can greatly facilitate later diagnosis and management.</p><p>Immediate, type I reactions occur in patients who have formed immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies against specific allergenic epitopes of a cephalosporin molecule (or a metabolite of the molecule, or the combination of the <span class=\"nowrap\">drug/metabolite</span> conjugated to serum proteins). If the patient with these antibodies receives the same drug again, the drug (or its metabolite, etc) reacts with IgE bound to the surface of mast cells and basophils and leads to the activation, degranulation, and release of vasoactive mediators from these cells. These mediators cause the signs and symptoms of IgE-mediated allergic reactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H202211\"><span class=\"h3\">Anaphylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaphylaxis, the most severe and dangerous form of IgE-mediated reactions, may present with a spectrum of possible signs and symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66333\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66333 \">table 2</a>). Cephalosporin-induced anaphylaxis may be fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-15</a>].</p><p>Anaphylactic reactions to cephalosporins are rare (frequency 0.0001 to 0.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], although an increasing number of such reactions have been reported in the last decade. Any cephalosporin can cause anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H207320\"><span class=\"h4\">Possible allergens and cross reactivity with penicillins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may develop IgE antibodies against antigenic determinants that are unique to cephalosporins or to determinants that are shared with other beta-lactam drugs, particularly the penicillins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/66-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-70</a>]. The core structure of both penicillins and cephalosporins contains a four-membered beta-lactam ring. Patients may become sensitized to this core structure or to metabolites of it, or to one of the two antigenic side chain groups (R1 and R2) that are unique to cephalosporins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F69298\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69298 \">figure 1</a>). The frequency with which people become sensitized to these different moieties is believed to be as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensitization to structurally similar R1 side chain groups (most common)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensitization to structurally similar R2 side chain groups (infrequent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensitization to the core beta-lactam ring or its metabolites (infrequent)</p><p/><p>The following clinical observations have been made about patients with immediate reactions to a cephalosporin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,29,37,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,29,37,40</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A significant percentage (ie, up to 37 percent in large studies) of patients who react to one cephalosporin will react to other cephalosporins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with immediate reactions to cephalosporins are allergic only to cephalosporins and <strong>not</strong> to penicillins.

There are numerous studies in which positive in vitro tests or skin tests are obtained with cephalosporins that contain similar or identical side chains, but for obvious ethical reasons, most protocols do not challenge patients with positive tests to the drug in question. Thus, it is rarely known if these results translate into actual clinical cross reactivity. Penicillin skin testing, which is far better validated than cephalosporin skin testing, illustrates this point. Among patients with positive skin tests to penicillin, 40 to 100 percent will react upon challenge. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-skin-testing#H22604340\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penicillin skin testing&quot;, section on 'Interpretation of results'</a>.)</p><p>Studies by pharmacology investigators have grouped penicillins and cephalosporins according to side chain structures, although data to support the clinical relevance of these groupings is largely lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. The clinician must not falsely assume that because two cephalosporins have different side chain groups, that the patient will not react to both. Instead, it is better to be cautious and consult an allergy specialist for assistance with patients with severe past reactions.</p><p>Issues of cross reactivity among cephalosporins and between cephalosporins and penicillins, carbapenems, and monobactams are discussed in more detail separately.

For injectable cephalosporins, the intravenous form is used. For noninjectable cephalosporins, the powder contained in capsules or obtained by removing the external layer of tablets with a scalpel is used. After weighing the powder, solutions are prepared under a laminar flow hood, as previously described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/105,106\" class=\"abstract_t\">105,106</a>], and are sterilized by filtration through single-use devices (Minisart NML Syringe Filter, 0.20 micrometers, Sartorius AG, Goettingen, Germany) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The author's approach is to spread testing over three separate days to allow for delayed reactions. Testing with penicillin reagents is performed on one day, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> on another, and testing to cephalosporins on a third day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,37</a>]. However, this may not be feasible in some settings, and the full panel of tests may not be clinically indicated in all situations. For example, if a patient developed hives to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefpodoxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefpodoxime</a> but had no known adverse reaction to penicillin, and the clinician simply wanted to determine if it was safe to treat the patient with penicillins in the future, then it might be sufficient just to skin test with the classic penicillin reagents and with the selected penicillin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H206017\"><span class=\"h4\">Positive results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A positive skin test (on the volar forearm) to a cephalosporin drug may be defined as a wheal &gt;3 mm in diameter, with surrounding erythema, that develops within 20 minutes of placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/37,106\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,106</a>]. If the skin test response is positive, it implies the presence of drug-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies and potential clinical allergy. However, as with skin testing for most drugs, the positive predictive value has not been precisely defined because this would require administering the drug to large numbers of skin test-positive patients with no personal benefit to confirm that they are truly reactive. Such testing would pose ethical issues and thus has not been done. Cephalosporins that yield positive skin tests should not be given except through a desensitization protocol. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid drug desensitization for immediate hypersensitivity reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The sensitivity of skin testing with cephalosporins has been estimated in three European studies involving children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], both children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], with histories of immediate reactions to these beta-lactams. Skin testing was positive in 72, 31, and 70 percent of patients in these studies, respectively, although patients with positive test results were not challenged to confirm if these were true positives (for the ethical reasons mentioned previously). By comparison, the rates of positive reactions in these studies are much higher than the rates obtained if penicillin-allergic patients are tested with native penicillin. However, a Korean study performed in 1421 subjects with past exposure but without a history of hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins found extremely low sensitivity and low positive-predictive value of intradermal tests with cephalosporins in this clinical setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].

However, the patient could still have IgE antibodies against a metabolite or metabolite-protein complex, and the negative-predictive value of cephalosporin skin testing is not well defined. Therefore, a negative result should not be interpreted as definitive proof that allergy is not present.</p><p>As an example, in a study of adult patients with immediate reactions to cephalosporins, 8 of 13 adults with negative tests agreed to undergo challenges with the suspect drug, and two patients reacted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H206038\"><span class=\"h3\">In vitro assays for cephalosporin allergy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In vitro assays for cephalosporin-specific IgE are not commonly used because they are less sensitive than skin testing and not widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/37,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,94</a>].

Graded challenges often require experience to interpret properly because patients can develop nonspecific or anxiety-related symptoms. As discussed previously, the specificity of skin testing appears to be sufficiently high that we do NOT recommend performing challenges with cephalosporins to which patients are skin-test positive. (See <a href=\"#H206017\" class=\"local\">'Positive results'</a> above.)</p><p>Graded challenges are usually performed for one of two reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>To identify a safe alternative drug</strong> &ndash; The most common reason for performing a graded challenge is to confirm that a patient can safely receive an alternative cephalosporin (<strong>other than the culprit drug</strong>) to which there is no evidence of allergy after evaluation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The starting dose for a graded challenge is usually <span class=\"nowrap\">1/100</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">1/10</span> of the full dose, depending on the severity and recentness of the reaction. Tenfold increasing doses are administered every 30 to 60 minutes until the full therapeutic dose is reached. A simple challenge for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cephalexin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cephalexin</a> would be 5 mg, 50 mg, and 500 mg given orally at 60-minute intervals, using dilutions of a standard oral suspension, or the powder obtained from tablets. A lower starting dose should be used in patients with severe reactions. The cumulative dose must be adjusted for children or in subjects with kidney or liver disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>To prove or disprove allergy</strong> &ndash; Graded challenge with the <strong>culprit</strong> cephalosporin may be performed in selected patients with negative skin testing results, according to the recommendations of both the American and European guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/114,115\" class=\"abstract_t\">114,115</a>]. This is done to confirm or disprove the presence of allergy with certainty.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients who develop symptoms consistent with an IgE-mediated reaction during or shortly after the graded challenge (within a few hours of receiving the full dose), should be treated appropriately and should not receive further drug. These patients should be considered allergic to that agent and it should be avoided or, if critical, administered via a formal desensitization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-drug-desensitization-for-immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid drug desensitization for immediate hypersensitivity reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H206081\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk of resensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the case of immediate reactions to beta-lactams, negative skin test results should be interpreted in light of the time elapsed since the subject's last exposure to the drug. In reports of patients with IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to cephalosporins, skin tests are more likely to be positive the less time has elapsed since the clinical reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,37,116\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,37,116</a>]. Therefore, in subjects with immediate reactions to cephalosporins who have negative skin tests when evaluated more than six months after their last reaction, the author performs challenges with suspected cephalosporins and, in case of negative responses, administers a full therapeutic course. In addition, the author retests such patients after four weeks to determine if there has been resensitization after previous loss of sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/37,93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,93,94</a>]. Resensitization (diagnosed on the basis of renewed skin test positivity) has been observed in a few patients retested about one month after either negative challenges (whether followed by a full therapeutic course or not), or after positive challenges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,37,116\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,37,116</a>].</p><p>In summary, resensitization is possible, although the rate at which this occurs in not defined. We suggest that patients with severe IgE-mediated reactions in past be retested before subsequent courses of treatment if they require the same cephalosporin (that caused the reaction) in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H208530\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of nonimmediate reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The manner in which nonimmediate drug reactions are evaluated differs significantly between the United States and Europe:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In European centers, patients with more severe and systemic nonimmediate reactions, such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), also called drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DiHS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), are evaluated with both patch tests and delayed reading of intradermal tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/93,117\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,117</a>]. Patch tests are usually performed first (ie, prior to intradermal testing). In a multicenter study of subjects with these reactions, patch tests were first performed with drugs diluted to 1 percent, and if the results were negative, patch testing was repeated with the drug diluted to 30 percent in petrolatum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Positive responses were observed for 24 different drugs. Patch tests were positive in 46 of 72 patients with DRESS (including two subjects who had reacted to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>), 26 of 45 with AGEP (including one subject who had reacted to ceftriaxone), and 4 of 17 with SJS&frasl;TEN, with only one relapse of AGEP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-reaction-with-eosinophilia-and-systemic-symptoms-dress#H2711189\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)&quot;, section on 'Assessment of drug causality'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patch tests and delayed-reading intradermal tests are negative in most patients who experienced mild nonimmediate reactions, such as urticarial eruptions, angioedematous manifestations, and maculopapular rashes lasting a few days. In a study of patients with cutaneous reactions to cephalosporins, patch testing with the implicated cephalosporin was positive in just 4 percent (12 of 290) of mild nonimmediate reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. In the aforementioned study by the author's group, only 5 of the 105 adults with histories of nonimmediate reactions to cephalosporins presented positive responses to delayed-reading intradermal tests with the responsible compounds, three of whom were also patch-test positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Taking into account these results, subjects with mild nonimmediate reactions can be evaluated using a simplified diagnostic workup, which does not include patch tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are additional case reports of patients with maculopapular rashes in whom patch tests <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delayed-reading intradermal tests were positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/73,119-124\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,119-124</a>]. Because the sensitivity of predictive use of patch testing and delayed-reading of intradermal skin testing is low, provocation tests with the suspected cephalosporins, when appropriate, may be needed to establish the diagnosis when testing is negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/93,117\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,117</a>]. The negative predictive value of either patch testing or delayed reading of intradermal skin testing appears to be high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,72,73</a>], although more work is needed. The timing with which these tests are performed does not appear to impact the results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, patch testing and delayed-reading intradermal tests are not widely performed. Instead, the most common approach in the United States is to diagnose nonimmediate reactions to cephalosporins based upon signs and symptoms. In patients with severe reactions, such as TEN, SJS, <span class=\"nowrap\">DRESS/DiHS,</span> and AGEP, cephalosporins are simply avoided in the future. If the nonimmediate reaction involved hives or angioedema, the patient may be evaluated for IgE-mediated allergy to the cephalosporin that caused the reaction, as well as the cephalosporin that is needed in the immediate future. If the patient's past reaction did <strong>not</strong> involve hives or angioedema and was mild (eg, maculopapular rash), then a graded challenge to the desired cephalosporin (generally not the same drug that caused the initial reaction, although the same drug can be used if it is superior for the treatment of a particular infection) can be performed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89835615\"><span class=\"h3\">Challenges for nonimmediate reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For delayed or nonimmediate types of reactions, challenge procedures are not standardized and different experts have distinct approaches. The optimal approach is not known, and the issues with such challenges are described in this section. The limitations of challenges should be explained to patients.</p><p>In general, challenge protocols are based upon the time course of the patient's reaction and the pharmacology of the drug involved. The time between doses should be long enough that delayed symptoms have time to develop before the next higher dose is administered.</p><p>The author's approach to challenging patients with past delayed reactions to cephalosporins is to give increasing doses at weekly intervals as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Day 1 &ndash; Administer <span class=\"nowrap\">1/100</span> of a usual dose</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Day 7 &ndash; Administer <span class=\"nowrap\">1/10</span> of a usual dose</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Day 14 &ndash; Administer a full dose</p><p>However, a negative result may not preclude a nonimmediate reaction with full therapeutic treatment. Specifically, studies of penicillin reactions have documented that some delayed reactions only develop after several days of a full therapeutic dose or in the presence of a concomitant viral infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/125,126\" class=\"abstract_t\">125,126</a>]. Thus, there may be certain drug reactions that cannot be elicited with any challenge protocol and will only recur if the drug is used for therapy again in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cephalosporin-allergy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>].</p><p>Rare forms of nonimmediate reactions, such as serum sickness or drug fever, are not diagnosed with any type of skin testing, because these tests do not provide clinically relevant information about these reactions, which are often related to the intensity and duration of treatment. Patients who experienced these types of reactions should not be given the same cephalosporins again unless under the supervision of a drug allergy specialist.
