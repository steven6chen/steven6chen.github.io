As a result, strategies of mechanical ventilation that reduce the incidence and severity of ventilator-associated lung injury are being sought. The mechanical ventilatory strategies known as low tidal volume ventilation, open lung ventilation, and high positive end-expiratory pressure (high PEEP) are reviewed here. In addition, recruitment maneuvers and titration of PEEP are described. </p><p>The Berlin Definition of ARDS (published in 2012) has replaced the American-European Consensus Conference&rsquo;s definition of ARDS (published in 1994) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, it should be recognized that most evidence is based upon prior definitions. The current diagnostic criteria for ARDS are provided separately.

For patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), we and others recommend low tidal volume ventilation (4 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> predicted body weight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F87507\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87507 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F87147\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87147 \">table 2</a>)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. We suggest adjusting the tidal volume to achieve an inspiratory plateau airway pressure &le;30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57072 \">table 3</a>). The rationale for this approach is that, on balance, meta-analyses and randomized trials have reported improved outcomes from LTVV. The rationale behind the efficacy of LTVV is that smaller tidal volumes are less likely to generate alveolar overdistension, one of the principal causes of ventilator-associated lung injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventilator-induced-lung-injury#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventilator-induced lung injury&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Benefit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Collectively, evidence suggests that the early application of and adherence to LTVV improves mortality, as well as other clinically important outcomes in patients with ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The multicenter ARMA trial randomly assigned 861 mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS to receive LTVV (initial tidal volume of 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> predicted body weight [PBW]) or conventional mechanical ventilation (initial tidal volume of 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> PBW) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The LTVV group had a lower mortality rate (31 versus 40 percent) and more ventilator-free days (12 versus 10 days).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of six randomized trials (1297 patients) found that LTVV significantly improved 28 day mortality (27.4 versus 37 percent, relative risk 0.74, 95% CI 0.61-0.88) and hospital mortality (34.5 versus 43.2 percent, relative risk 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.92), when compared with conventional mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This was supported by a more recent meta-analysis of four randomized trials (1149 patients) that also found that LTVV reduced hospital mortality (34.2 versus 41 percent, odds ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.96), when compared with conventional mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In contrast, another meta-analysis of seven trials reported lower mortality in those treated with LTVV that was not significant when compared with non-volume limited strategies (40 versus 34 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. No difference in rates of barotrauma or ventilator-free days was reported. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In two prospective cohort studies of 485 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for ARDS, poor adherence to LTVV was associated with increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In one analysis, when adherence to LTVV fell from 100 to 50 or 0 percent, two year mortality increased by 4 and 8 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In the second analysis, an <strong>initial </strong>tidal volume of 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> PBW was associated with a 23 percent increase in ICU mortality when compared with those receiving the standard tidal volume of 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> PBW (hazard ratio 1.23; 95% CI 1.06-1.44) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Later increases in tidal volume by 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> PBW also resulted in a 15 percent increase in mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02&ndash;1.29). Thus, we believe that in patients with ARDS, in order to gain a mortality benefit, strict adherence to LTVV throughout the course of mechanical ventilation is prudent. Similarly one meta-analysis of seven studies reported a similar inverse relationship between tidal volume and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Harm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LTVV is generally well tolerated. It was not associated with any clinically important adverse outcomes in the ARMA trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. With respect to physiologic adverse outcomes, LTVV caused hypercapnic respiratory acidosis in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Hypercapnic respiratory acidosis was an expected and generally well tolerated consequence of LTVV. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Permissive hypercapnia'</a> below.)</p><p>Two major concerns were expressed after publication of the ARMA trial. First, the beneficial effects of LTVV may be the result of auto-PEEP rather than the low tidal volume. Second, LTVV may require increased sedation, increasing the risk of sedation-related adverse effects. These concerns have since been addressed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Auto-PEEP &ndash; In theory, the higher respiratory rates that are used to maintain minute ventilation during LTVV may create auto-PEEP by decreasing the time available for complete expiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, a subgroup analysis from the ARMA trial detected negligible quantities of auto-PEEP in both the LTVV and conventional mechanical ventilation groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

While asynchrony may require increased sedation soon after the initiation of LTVV, the need for increased sedation does not appear to persist. In a post-hoc analysis of data from a single center involved in the ARMA trial, there were no significant differences in the percentage of days patients received sedatives, opioids, or neuromuscular blockade when the LTVV group was compared with the conventional mechanical ventilation group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>Breath stacking is a manifestation of asynchrony that can occur despite deep sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. It causes episodic delivery of higher tidal volumes, which may undermine the benefits of LTVV. Frequent breath stacking (more than three stacked <span class=\"nowrap\">breaths/min)</span> can be ameliorated by delivering slightly higher tidal volumes (7 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> PBW), as long as the plateau airway pressure remains less than 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, or by administering additional sedation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sedative-analgesic-medications-in-critically-ill-adults-selection-initiation-maintenance-and-withdrawal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Selection, initiation, maintenance, and withdrawal&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Application</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LTVV can be performed using a protocol similar to that used in the ARMA trial (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57072 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The initial tidal volume is set to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> PBW and the initial respiratory rate is set to meet the patient's minute ventilation requirements. Over the next one to three hours, the tidal volume is reduced to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> PBW and then 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> PBW. The PBW is calculated using the following equations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F87507\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87507 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F87147\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87147 \">table 2</a>):</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For females: PBW = 45.5 + 0.91 * (height - 152.4)</p></div></div><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For males: PBW = 50 + 0.91 * (height - 152.4)</p></div></div><p/><p>where PBW is expressed in kg and height is expressed in cm.</p><p>The respiratory rate is increased (up to a maximum of 35 breaths per minute) as the tidal volume is decreased, so that the ventilator continues to deliver the patient's entire minute ventilation.</p><p>Subsequent tidal volume adjustments are made on the basis of the plateau airway pressure, as measured using a 0.5 second inspiratory breath hold. The plateau airway pressure is checked at least every four hours and after each change in PEEP or tidal volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The goal plateau airway pressure is &le;30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. When the plateau airway pressure is &gt;30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, the tidal volume is decreased in 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> PBW increments to a minimum of 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> PBW. Measurement of the plateau airway pressure is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-management-and-prevention-of-pulmonary-barotrauma-during-invasive-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults#H1064990298\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis, management, and prevention of pulmonary barotrauma during invasive mechanical ventilation in adults&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>A threshold plateau airway pressure below which safety is certain has not been determined. The goal plateau airway pressure of &le;30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O is based on the ARMA trial. However, a goal plateau airway pressure &lt;28 cm H<sub>2</sub>O is more appealing since this decreases alveolar overdistension and makes it unlikely that thresholds of lung strain will be exceeded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. It seems reasonable to strive to keep the plateau airway pressure as low as possible, using LTVV even if the plateau airway pressure is already below 30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>A reasonable oxygenation goal during LTVV is an arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) between 55 and 80 mmHg (7.3 to 10.6 kPa) or an oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) between 88 and 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This is typically achieved by adjusting the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) and the applied PEEP. The allowable combinations of FiO<sub>2</sub> and PEEP that were used in the ARMA trial are included in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57072 \">table 3</a>). An outcomes study in ARDS survivors suggested an association between lower arterial partial pressure of oxygen during the patient&rsquo;s acute illness and long term cognitive and psychiatric impairment. Additional research is needed to determine whether these observations should change oxygenation goals during acute management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>The use of a written protocol outlining how to provide lung protective mechanical ventilation is associated with enhanced compliance with LTVV in patients with ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This approach should be considered in all institutions that provide care to such patients.</p><p>A 2016 multicenter, international prospective cohort study of 3022 patients with ARDS reported that ARDS was recognized by clinicians only 60 percent of the time and less than two-thirds of ARDS patients received a tidal volume of &le;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> PBW, suggesting that despite the benefits of this strategy, ARDS is under recognized and low tidal volume ventilation is underutilized by clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Permissive hypercapnia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LTVV frequently requires permissive hypercapnic ventilation (PHV), a ventilatory strategy that accepts alveolar hypoventilation in order to maintain a low alveolar pressure and minimize the complications of alveolar overdistension (eg, ventilator-associated lung injury). Hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis are a consequence of this strategy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permissive-hypercapnia-during-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Permissive hypercapnia during mechanical ventilation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The degree of hypercapnia can be minimized by using the highest respiratory rate that does not induce auto-PEEP and shortening the ventilator tubing to decrease dead space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, changing from a heat and moisture exchanger to a heated humidifier appears to decrease hypercapnia by decreasing dead space ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Animal studies suggest that PHV may attenuate ventilator-associated lung injury by effects that are independent of the LTVV from which it results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. It is uncertain if this effect exists in humans. In a post hoc analysis of the ARMA trial, respiratory acidosis (pH 7.15 to 7.35; arterial carbon dioxide tension [PaCO<sub>2</sub>] 45 to 65 mmHg) on day 1 was associated with reduced 28-day mortality in the control group, but not the LTVV group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There are several reasonable interpretations of these data, including the possibility that respiratory acidosis is protective against ventilator-associated lung injury but these data are fundamentally flawed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">OPEN LUNG VENTILATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open lung ventilation (OLV) is a strategy that combines low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) with a recruitment maneuver and subsequent titration of applied PEEP to maximize alveolar recruitment. The LTVV and set limits on plateau pressure aim to mitigate alveolar overdistension, while the applied PEEP seeks to minimize cyclic atelectasis. Together, these effects are expected to decrease the risk of ventilator-associated lung injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventilator-induced-lung-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventilator-induced lung injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>On balance, most trials do not show convincing benefit and some show possible harm such that we suggest avoiding the routine application of open lung strategies as an initial strategy in patients with ARDS. However, many of the trials used different recruitment maneuvers and PEEP strategies which may explain the variability in the responses to OLV noted among trials; alternatively, variability may suggest possible subgroups, some that may respond to OLV and others that do not respond (ie, responders versus nonresponders). In our opinion, any use of OLV strategies should be limited to those with severe ARDS refractory to standard LTVV strategies; in addition, when employed, patients should be closely observed for an oxygenation response, so that the clinician can decide whether it is appropriate to continue or abandon the OLV trial. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Benefit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some clinical trials indicate that open lung ventilation may improve mortality, other clinically important outcomes, and oxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>].

However, one well-conducted randomized trial reported harm in association with OLV. In an international randomized trial (Alveolar Recruitment for ARDS Trial, ART), 983 mechanically ventilated patients with moderate to severe ARDS were randomized to a conventional ventilation versus an open lung ventilation strategy that included a prolonged recruitment maneuver and a decremental titration of PEEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

We do not recommend the routine use of a high PEEP strategy in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients as an initial strategy. However, in patients refractory to standard methods of mechanical ventilation, some experts use a high PEEP strategy such as that employed in the ALVEOLI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62961\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62961 \">table 4</a>) or LOVS trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] (ie, trials that demonstrated possible benefit); importantly, when used, clinicians should assess whether patients' oxygenation improves (ie, responders with recruitable lung) or fails to improve (ie, nonresponders with lung that is not recruitable) so that a decision can be made as to whether it is appropriate to continue or abandon the high PEEP strategy. In the absence of data, the duration of the trial could be left to the discretion of the treating physician. In the experience of the authors, however, improvements in oxygenation generally occur relatively quickly (eg, two to four hours). </p><p>It is thought that use of higher levels of PEEP benefit patients by opening collapsed alveoli, which in turn serves to decrease alveolar overdistension because the volume of each subsequent tidal breath is shared by more open alveoli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. If the alveoli remain open throughout the respiratory cycle (ie, they don&rsquo;t collapse during exhalation), cyclic atelectasis is also reduced. Alveolar overdistension and cyclic atelectasis are the principal causes of ventilator-associated lung injury. However, despite this theory the trials described below suggest that the clinical relevance of improved oxygenation from the application of high PEEP in patients with ARDS is unclear, particularly when low tidal volume ventilation is concurrently used. The application of high PEEP does not appear to be associated with improved mortality except perhaps in those with severe gas exchange abnormalities. Further study is needed to determine the optimal level of PEEP and the ARDS population in whom a clear mortality benefit might be expected.

When considering all patients ventilated in the intensive care unit (ICU) for ARDS, particularly those on low tidal volume ventilation, evidence suggests that there is no clear mortality benefit associated with the use of high PEEP.

The inclusion of patients in this meta-analysis from an era where lung protective ventilation is common may help explain some of the contrasting findings with the 2010 meta-analysis. In this setting, high PEEP was not associated with an in-hospital mortality benefit (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81-1.01). Although considerable heterogeneity between studies was observed, oxygenation was improved in the high-PEEP group (mean difference in PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub></span> ratio 41 mmHg, 95% CI 24-58), without any improvement in the number of ventilator-free days.

In contrast, it increased alveolar strain without reducing cyclic atelectasis among patients with little recruitable lung. Future trials comparing higher levels of PEEP to lower levels should be restricted to patients with a significant amount of recruitable lung, since this population is most likely to benefit from high PEEP.

We believe that there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of recruitment maneuvers in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and, if utilized, would avoid the use of recruitment maneuvers of excess duration. </p><p>However, the possibility that some patients with ARDS may benefit from recruitment maneuvers cannot be excluded, since patients with ARDS are a heterogeneous population. While guidelines suggest use of recruitment in patients with ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], little guidance is provided with respect to the optimal method, timing, and target population. Recruitment maneuvers may be particularly beneficial after a patient has been disconnected from the ventilator (eg, tubing changes, transport) because even a brief moment without positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can result in alveolar collapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].

The impact of routine recruitment maneuvers on clinical outcomes is unclear, although meta-analyses do not report convincing benefits on mortality, length of hospital stay, or the incidence of barotrauma, despite improving the arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/32,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,55</a>]. Recruitment maneuvers that are used as part of an open lung strategy are also of unclear benefit and may in fact be harmful. For example, an extended duration recruitment maneuver (two to four minutes) was employed in the ART trial and may have contributed to increased mortality in the open lung ventilation group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

These effects are generally self-limited and without serious consequences. Nevertheless, there may be some risk of barotrauma and cardiac arrest when a recruitment maneuver is carried out for an extended duration. </p><p>The purpose of recruitment maneuvers is to open alveoli that have collapsed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. There is no consensus regarding the best level of continuous positive airway pressure or the optimal frequency or duration of the maneuvers, although one study found that most of the alveolar recruitment occurred during the first ten seconds of the maneuver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. This was followed by a decrease in the blood pressure, which recovered within 30 seconds after the recruitment maneuver. Significant alveolar overdistention does not appear to occur during a single recruitment maneuver (but may occur with frequent recruitment maneuvers) and the recruited alveoli tend to remain open when lower airway pressures are reinstituted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/56,58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,58,59</a>].</p><p>The PaO<sub>2</sub> generally increases after a recruitment maneuver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

These include whether a trial of noninvasive mechanical ventilation should be performed, the preferred mode of mechanical ventilation, what to do if there is refractory hypoxemia, how to optimally titrate positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV), and whether to use neuromuscular blockade.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Invasive versus noninvasive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most clinicians use invasive mechanical ventilation for patients with ARDS. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) may be reserved for the occasional patient with ARDS who is hemodynamically stable, is easily oxygenated, does not need immediate intubation, and has no contraindications to its use. This conservative approach is based upon conflicting data regarding benefits and harm of NIV in this population. Additional studies proving conclusive benefit are necessary before more precise recommendations regarding patient selection, mask type, and optimal settings can be made regarding its use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=types-of-noninvasive-nocturnal-ventilatory-support-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Types of noninvasive nocturnal ventilatory support in neuromuscular and chest wall disease&quot;, section on 'Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Practical aspects of nocturnal noninvasive ventilation in neuromuscular and chest wall disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies that report the role of NIV in patients with ARDS include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a single-center trial, 83 patients with ARDS who required NIV using full face mask for at least eight hours were randomly assigned to continue face mask NIV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F91182\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91182 \">picture 1</a>) or switch to helmet-delivered NIV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F108315\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108315 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Helmet-delivered NIV involves the administration of positive pressure and oxygen through a transparent hood that covers the entire head and face and is sealed with a rubber collar at the neck. Helmet-delivered NIV reduced the need for intubation (18 versus 62 percent) in ARDS patients, most of whom had mild or moderate disease. In addition, it was also associated with a higher rate of ventilator-free days, shorter ICU stay, and lower 90-day mortality without an increase in adverse effects. Although encouraging, this was a small, single-center unblinded study performed by experts in the technique. The study was also stopped early, which may make it more likely that the effect size is exaggerated. Until the physiological effects and clinical outcome of helmet ventilation as well as details regarding appropriate monitoring (eg, tidal volume) are further studied, we cannot recommend its routine use as a ventilatory strategy for patients with ARDS. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small (n = 40) trial randomly assigned patients with ARDS to receive either NIV or high concentration supplemental oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

Several limitations undermine the conclusions that can be drawn from this trial. First, the study was small and, therefore, the estimated effect size should be considered imprecise and the risk of adverse events may have been underestimated. Second, selection bias may have been introduced since some participating physicians may have favored NIV, which may have deterred enrollment. Third, caregivers were not blinded, and this could have influenced decisions to intubate. Finally, patients with standard criteria for excluding use of NIV as well as patients greater than 70 years of age, with multiple organ failure, or a PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub></span> &lt;200 were excluded from participation and, therefore, the findings of this study cannot be applied to such patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure reported increased mortality in association with NIV when compared with patients treated with high flow nasal cannula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

In most patients with ARDS, a volume limited mode will produce a stable airway pressure and a pressure limited mode will deliver stable tidal volumes, assuming that breath to breath lung mechanics and patient effort are stable. Abrupt changes in the airway pressure in a patient receiving volume limited ventilation, or in tidal volumes in a patient receiving pressure limited ventilation, should prompt an immediate search for a cause of an acute change in compliance (eg, pneumothorax or an obstructed endotracheal tube).</p><p>In order to adhere to a strategy of LTVV, it is probably easier to use a volume limited approach. However, a pressure limited mode is an acceptable alternative, as long as the resulting tidal volumes are stable and consistent with the strategy of LTVV.</p><p>Regardless of whether volume limited or pressure limited ventilation is chosen, fully supported modes of mechanical ventilation (eg, assist control) are generally favored over partially supported modes (eg, synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation [SIMV]).

In this situation, increasing the I:E ratio by prolonging inspiratory time may improve oxygenation. The inspiratory time can be directly set during pressure limited ventilation. It is indirectly prolonged during volume limited ventilation by decreasing the inspiratory flow rate, changing from a square wave to a decelerating wave, or providing an end inspiratory breath hold. Increasing the I:E ratio will increase the mean airway pressure and may improve oxygenation in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/71-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-74</a>].</p><p>Prolonging the inspiratory time can be an effective means of improving oxygenation in some patients with ARDS because the parenchymal abnormalities are heterogeneous, with different areas of the lung requiring more time to open and participate in gas exchange. It can be considered in patients who remain severely hypoxemic despite a high FiO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>There are potential costs associated with prolonging the inspiratory time that should be considered. When the inspiratory time is increased, there is an obligatory decrease in the expiratory time. This can lead to air trapping, auto-PEEP, barotrauma, hemodynamic instability, and decreased oxygen delivery. In addition, a prolonged inspiratory time may require significant sedation or neuromuscular blockade, particularly if the inspiratory time surpasses the expiratory time (inverse ratio ventilation).</p><p>In addition to inverse ratio ventilation, high applied PEEP should be administered to patients with refractory hypoxemia before implementing other rescue interventions (eg, high frequency ventilation).

(See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Open lung ventilation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'High PEEP'</a> above.)</p><p>Titration according to physiologic measures is of theoretical, but unproven, benefit.

The esophageal pressure group also had an almost statistically significant reduction in 28-day mortality (17 versus 39 percent, adjusted relative risk 0.46, 95% CI 0.19-1.00).

Improved oxygenation alone is insufficient to warrant a change in routine clinical practice because prior studies have NOT shown an association between survival and improved oxygenation, particularly when the latter is achieved with a potentially harmful mechanical ventilation strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is difficult for most centers to justify the inconvenience and cost of obtaining the necessary equipment and expertise without more certain evidence of clinical benefit. However, in centers that already have the necessary equipment and expertise, esophageal pressure-guided mechanical ventilation may be helpful in the management of patients with ARDS, especially if there are concerns that airway pressures do not accurately reflect distending pressures in the lung (eg, when there is external compression of the lung due to abdominal compartment syndrome, chest wall deformities, or large pleural effusion).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">PV curves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many patients with early ARDS, pressure-volume (PV) curves appear flat at low lung volumes (low compliance), become steeper at higher lung volumes (higher compliance), and then flatten again at even higher lung volumes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72036\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72036 \">figure 2</a>). The lower inflection point is the transition from low to higher compliance, while the upper inflection point is the transition from higher to low compliance. There are two methods of titrating applied PEEP that require a PV curve:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first method involves using a level of applied PEEP that is slightly above the lower inflection point (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72036\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72036 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/78-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-80</a>]. The trials of open lung ventilation described above are examples of this method. Specifically, they used an applied PEEP that was 2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O greater than the lower inflection point that was chosen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second method involves using a level of applied PEEP that matches the pressure at which lung compliance is maximized. This is determined from the PV curve (slope equals compliance) or by stepwise titration of applied PEEP with calculation of compliance at each step [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/75,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,81</a>]. Compliance is calculated using the equation Crs = <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/(Ppl</span> - PEEP), where Crs is the compliance, VT is the tidal volume, and Ppl is the plateau airway pressure. Measurement of the plateau airway pressure is described separately.

Among the limitations, the lower inflection point cannot be identified in some patients and neuromuscular blockade or apneic-level sedation is generally required to accurately construct a PV curve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/75,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,83</a>]. A novel approach to plotting a pressure-volume curve that doesn't require neuromuscular blockade has been used in several clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/45,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,88</a>]. Following five cycles of controlled ventilation, the inspiratory to expiratory ratio is set to 80 percent, the respiratory rate is set to five breaths per minute, and the tidal volume is set to 500 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Inspiratory flow is then administered for 9.6 seconds, during which a PV curve is generated on the ventilator screen. From this curve, the lower inflection point can be determined. This approach appears promising, but requires validation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Oxygenation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Applied PEEP can be titrated according to oxygenation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62961\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62961 \">table 4</a>). The lowest level of applied PEEP at which an adequate PaO<sub>2</sub> is maintained (with an FiO<sub>2</sub> less than 0.6) is used for ongoing mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. This approach to the titration of PEEP was used in trials that demonstrated a mortality benefit to low tidal volume mechanical ventilation in patients with ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

This method involves calculating the DO<sub>2</sub> at each level of applied PEEP, then using the applied PEEP that corresponds with the best DO<sub>2</sub> for ongoing mechanical ventilation.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygen-delivery-and-consumption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygen delivery and consumption&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23448052\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuromuscular blockade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been hypothesized that neuromuscular blockade might benefit patients with ARDS by eliminating ventilator asynchrony and reducing chest wall elastance, leading to a favorable transpulmonary pressure and equitable distribution of delivered gas. One randomized controlled trial and a meta-analysis have shown that neuromuscular blockade within the first 48 hours of mechanical ventilation is associated with a mortality benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,94</a>]. In addition, an observational study suggested a mortality benefit in patients with severe sepsis with a respiratory source who received early neuromuscular blockade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. This benefit may be partially explained by a reduction in hyperventilation of dependent lung by neuromuscular blockade that was shown in an animal model of lung injury (ie, the pendelluft phenomenon &ndash; movement of air from nondependent to dependent regions without change in tidal volume) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Although these findings are intriguing, the methodology in the human studies was flawed because confounding variables that may have contributed to the apparent benefit of neuromuscular blockade were not measured. Additional studies are required before definitive recommendations for the routine use of neuromuscular blockade in patients with ARDS can be made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].

Lung protective ventilation strategies traditionally use low tidal volume (VT)&nbsp;and plateau pressure (pPlat), with or without high positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP)&nbsp;to achieve this goal. Such lung-protective ventilation strategies are associated with limited driving pressure ([driving pressure = ventilator-measured plateau pressure minus applied PEEP] or <span class=\"nowrap\">[VT/respiratory</span> system compliance]). Whether driving pressure can be used as a predictor of survival in ARDS was examined in one retrospective statistical analysis of nine trials that included 3562 patients mechanically ventilated for ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. Among ventilator variables (eg, VT, PEEP, plateau pressure, driving pressure), driving pressure best predicted survival in patients with ARDS. An increase in driving pressure by 7 cm of water was associated with increased risk of death (relative risk [RR] 1.41; 95% CI, 1.31-1.51), even in patients receiving lung protective ventilation (RR 1.36; 95% CI, 1.17-1.58). However, further randomized trials comparing driving pressure with standard variables will be required before it can be routinely used to alter ventilator settings in this population. Thus, in patients with ARDS, we suggest the continued use of standard variables rather than driving pressure to manage ventilator settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
