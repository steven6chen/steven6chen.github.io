In the United States, there will be approximately 234,000 new cases of lung cancer and over 154,000 deaths annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-treatment-and-prognosis-of-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Both the absolute and relative frequencies of lung cancer have risen dramatically. Around 1953, lung cancer became the most common cause of cancer deaths in men. In 1985 it became the leading cause of cancer deaths in women, and now causes approximately twice as many deaths as breast cancer. Lung cancer deaths are declining in men, and the death rate in women has plateaued secondary to decreases in smoking. Now however, almost one-half of all lung cancer deaths occur in women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=women-and-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Women and lung cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The term lung cancer, or bronchogenic carcinoma, refers to malignancies that originate in the airways or pulmonary parenchyma. Approximately 95 percent of all lung cancers are classified as either small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This distinction is required for proper staging, treatment, and prognosis. Other cell types comprise about 5 percent of malignancies arising in the lung.</p><p>This discussion will present an overview of the initial diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of patients with both NSCLC and SCLC. An overview of the risk factors, pathology, and clinical manifestations of lung cancer is presented separately, as is an overview of the management of patients with advanced NSCLC, and a discussion of issues concerning lung cancer survivors.

These parameters are essential for appropriate patient management. The initial evaluation of a patient with suspected lung cancer is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-patients-with-suspected-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the initial evaluation, diagnosis, and staging of patients with suspected lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tissue diagnosis is necessary to determine whether a lung cancer is a NSCLC or an SCLC, as well as to rule out the possibility that disease represents a nonmalignant process or lung metastasis from a primary tumor at another site. This information is critical for treatment planning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedures-for-tissue-biopsy-in-patients-with-suspected-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedures for tissue biopsy in patients with suspected non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-the-incidental-pulmonary-nodule\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of the incidental pulmonary nodule&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staging for NSCLC is critical in determining the appropriate treatment for a patient with resectable disease and avoiding unnecessary and unhelpful surgery in advanced disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-treatment-and-prognosis-of-lung-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system is used for treatment planning and prognostic purposes in patients with NSCLC. The eighth edition is effective in the United States as of January 1, 2018 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 1</a>). However, outside of the United States, the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) has implemented the eighth edition changes as of January 1, 2017. The previous edition of the staging system is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system for lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staging of SCLC usually uses the Veterans Administration Lung Study Group designations of limited (confined to one hemithorax) or extensive (beyond one hemithorax) disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-treatment-and-prognosis-of-lung-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], although the TNM system is sometimes also used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F109805\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109805 \">table 1</a>). This distinction is important since treatment algorithms differ for patients with limited versus extensive stage disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology and staging of small cell carcinoma of the lung&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of lung cancer, whether with surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy (RT) or a combination of these, can be associated with substantial toxicity. Patients with significant impairment due to their lung cancer or comorbid conditions may not be able to withstand resection or alternatively aggressive chemoradiotherapy. Performance status can be assessed by a variety of methods including the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Scale (ECOG PS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 3</a>). The KPS was introduced in the 1940s and uses a 100-point scale and 11 measures to describe patient's abilities to pursue activities and perform work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-treatment-and-prognosis-of-lung-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The ECOG PS uses a five-point scale and has been shown in a comparative study to be a better predictor of prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-evaluation-treatment-and-prognosis-of-lung-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>Diagnostic procedures and staging should be carried out simultaneously, even though it may be tempting to simply pursue a diagnosis when an obvious abnormality is present on imaging. As an example, in a patient with a 4 cm lung mass and mediastinal adenopathy on CT, a mediastinal node biopsy may provide a diagnosis and confirm N2 (IIIA) disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59166\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59166 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80405\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80405 \">picture 1</a>). In contrast, a transthoracic needle aspirate of the mass may provide a tissue diagnosis but does not stage the mediastinum. This can lead to the inappropriate assumption that mediastinal lymph nodes are involved or necessitate a second procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system for lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">NSCLC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rapid advances in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of NSCLC have demonstrated that NSCLC is a heterogeneous group of diseases. Although the initial treatment of localized disease is the same, the molecular characterization of tumor tissue in patients with NSCLC serves as a guide to treatment both in those who present with metastatic disease and in those who relapse after primary therapy.

The appropriateness of surgical resection of candidates with known or suspected NSCLC includes preoperative staging and an assessment of performance status with concurrent comorbidities and pulmonary function to allow prediction of postoperative function.</p><p>A patient with lung cancer may be &ldquo;resectable&rdquo; by virtue of having a surgically removable NSCLC, but may not be &quot;operable&quot; due to poor pulmonary function or comorbidities.
