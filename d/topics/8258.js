Everyone has them, but some people have too much of them. This can cause high levels of triglycerides in the blood, also called &quot;high triglycerides.&quot;</p><p>Compared with people who have normal triglycerides, people with high triglycerides can have a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other health problems.</p><p>People with very high triglycerides can get inflammation in the pancreas. The pancreas is an organ that makes hormones and fluids to help the body break down food. When the pancreas gets inflamed, it can cause serious health problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1825682774\"><span class=\"h1\">What should my triglyceride level be?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ask your doctor or nurse what your triglyceride level should be. In general, levels are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal &ndash; Less than 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (If you live outside the United States, triglycerides are measured differently. The normal level is less than 1.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A little bit high &ndash; 150 to 499 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.7 to 5.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderately high &ndash; 500 to 886 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.6 to 10.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very high &ndash; Greater than 886 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span></p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1825682791\"><span class=\"h1\">Am I at higher risk for heart attack or stroke?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Having high triglycerides increases your risk of heart attacks and stroke. But this is just 1 of many things that can increase your risk. You are also at higher risk if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoke cigarettes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have high blood pressure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are overweight</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a parent, sister, or brother who got heart disease at a young age (Young, in this case, means younger than 55 for men and younger than 65 for women.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are a man &ndash; Women are at risk too, but men have a higher risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are older</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have diabetes &ndash; Especially if you cannot control your blood sugar well.</p><p/><p>Your doctor can talk to you about your personal risk of having a heart attack or stroke. There are things you can do to lower your risk. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1825682806\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I take medicine to lower my triglycerides?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not everyone who has high triglycerides needs medicines to lower them. Your doctor will decide if you need medicine. It depends on your age, family history, and other health concerns. </p><p>Medicines can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to lower triglyceride levels &ndash; These include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fenofibrate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">fenofibrate</a> (sample brand names: Antara, Fenoglide), nicotinic acid (sample brand names: Niacor, Niaspan), or fish oil (brand name: Lovaza).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Statins &ndash; These medicines can reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke. They are used to lower cholesterol levels in the body. Many people with high triglycerides also have high cholesterol.</p><p/><p>The medicine you take will depend on your triglyceride levels and other factors. If your triglycerides are very high, you might need more than 1 medicine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1825682823\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I lower my triglycerides without medicines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, you might be able to lower high triglycerides if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose weight (if you are overweight)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get regular exercise</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid foods and drinks with a lot of sugar and carbohydrates &ndash; These include white bread, fruit juice, soda, and sweets.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid red meat, butter, fried foods, cheese, oils, and nuts &ndash; This can help if your triglycerides are over 500.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limit alcohol &ndash; In you are a man, have 2 drinks a day or less. If you are a woman, have 1 drink a day or less. If your triglycerides are over 500, ask your doctor or nurse if it is safe to drink alcohol.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1825682840\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Exercise (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High cholesterol (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metabolic-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Metabolic syndrome (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brand-versus-generic-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brand versus generic medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-and-lipids-hyperlipidemia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High cholesterol and lipids (hyperlipidemia) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-metabolic-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: The metabolic syndrome (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
