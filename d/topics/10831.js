Even though the name MSMD implies infections with mycobacteria only, infections with other pathogens have been described with this disorder. Typically, patients with MSMD have increased susceptibility to systemic infections caused by pathogens with varying degrees of virulence, from weakly virulent environmental nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), to Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG), to disseminated infection with <em>Mycobacterium bovis</em> or <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </em>(TB). Other infections encountered in these genetically determined defects of host defense include intracellular pathogens other than mycobacteria, such as <em>Salmonella </em>species, <em>Listeria</em>, <em>Leishmania</em>, <em>Candida</em> (chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis), fungi (histoplasmosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, coccidioidomycosis), and viruses (cytomegalovirus virus [CMV], human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8), pseudorabies virus 3 [PRV3], respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], and varicella-zoster virus [VZV]). Common to all the infections seen in MSMD are defects in the interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)-interleukin 12 (IL-12) pathway <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> supporting accessory pathways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F50107\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50107 \">figure 1</a>). This topic reviews the pathogenesis, typical presentation, diagnosis, and general management of MSMD. Specific forms of MSMD are reviewed separately.

Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), a pleiotropic T helper cell type 1 (Th1)-type cytokine, is a principal factor in the elimination of both TB and the nontuberculous group of mycobacteria (NTM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-an-overview/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is also essential in the control of certain bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-an-overview/abstract/3-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Macrophages infected with mycobacteria produce the cytokine interleukin 12 (IL-12, which is a heterodimer of IL-12 p40 plus IL-12 p35) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-an-overview/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. IL-12 stimulates T cells and natural killer (NK) cells via its heterodimeric receptor (IL-12Rbeta1 plus IL-12Rbeta2). In response to stimulation with IL-12, activated T cells and NK cells produce IFN-gamma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F50107\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50107 \">figure 1</a>). IFN-gamma binds to its receptor, IFN-gamma-R1, with high affinity, leading to receptor dimerization. This is followed by aggregation of two accessory chains (IFN-gamma-R2) with the receptor complex. IFN-gamma-R2 is required for signal transduction.</p><p>Transphosphorylation of Janus kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1 and JAK2), the Janus kinases that are constitutively associated with IFN-gamma-R1 and IFN-gamma-R2 respectively, occurs next [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-an-overview/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The subsequent signaling event is the tyrosine phosphorylation of the latent cytosolic transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), which is followed by homodimerization and translocation of STAT1 to the nucleus as a complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F91737\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91737 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>This initiates the transcription of IFN-gamma-regulated genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-an-overview/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. One of the results of IFN-gamma activation on phagocytes is the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). In addition, there is further upregulation of IL-12 production. At this point, IFN-gamma also promotes mycobacterial killing, for which the mechanism remains unknown.</p><p>MSMD occurs when there are defects in the IFN-gamma pathway. Patients with defects in IFN-gamma-R1 (<em>IFNGR1</em>) or IFN-gamma-R2 (<em>IFNGR2</em>), IL-12 receptor beta1 (<em>IL12RB1</em>), IL-12 p40 (<em>IL12B</em>), <em>STAT1</em>, tyrosine kinase 2 (<em>TYK2</em>)<em>,</em> interferon regulatory factor 8 (<em>IRF8</em>), the zinc-finger transcription factor GATA2 (<em>GATA2</em>), and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (<em>ISG15</em>) have been identified. The pathogenic mechanisms associated with each specific defect are discussed in detail separately. Defects in two other genes have been identified that cause X-linked MSMD: <em>IKBKG</em> (encodes nuclear factor kappa B essential modulator [NEMO]) and <em>CYBB</em> (encodes gp91phox). NEMO deficiency is discussed separately. The genetic etiology has yet to be identified in approximately half of patients with MSMD.

Clinical manifestations are similar to that for environmental NTM infection, with a few exceptions. The lymph nodes draining the site of inoculation may enlarge and fistulize to skin and surrounding tissues, causing skin and soft tissue infection with direct spread or hematogenous spread to distant sites. Meningitis and osteomyelitis following BCG vaccination<em> </em>may accompany the other findings.

PCR testing is adequate for differentiating NTM from <em>M. tuberculosis</em> (TB) and can usually distinguish which species of NTM is causing infection, but a positive culture is required to perform drug-susceptibility testing. In patients with negative cultures and PCR, histopathology of tissue specimens demonstrating acid-fast bacilli (AFB) or granulomas (in forms of MSMD in which granuloma formation is possible) supports the diagnosis. However, the absence of these findings does not exclude NTM disease. Diagnostic testing for NTM infection is discussed in greater detail separately.

However, the value of tuberculin skin testing for initial diagnosis and following response to treatment is limited in MSMD since patients overtly sick with disseminated NTM or TB may be anergic given the nature of the immune response in the immune-compromised host.</p><p>The quantiferon gold test is an IFN-gamma release assay that measures IFN-gamma production after exposure of a blood sample to TB antigens. It is used to identify latent TB infection. Results are not affected by BCG vaccination.

IFN-gamma is a principal factor in the elimination of both TB and NTM. Genetic defects in the IFN-gamma pathway result in Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD). Patients with defects in IFN-gamma receptor 1 (IFN-gamma-R1), IFN-gamma receptor 2 (IFN-gamma-R2), interleukin-12 receptor beta1 (IL12RB1), IL-12 p40, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), GATA2, and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) have been identified. Defects in nuclear factor kappa B essential modulator (NEMO) and gp91phox can cause X-linked MSMD. (See <a href=\"#H26818144\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis is established by flow cytometric evaluation of cell surface receptor expression on monocytes and lymphocytes as well as examining signaling either by intracellular staining (eg, lack of STAT1 phosphorylation in response to IFN-gamma or STAT4 phosphorylation in response to IL-12) or western blot. Detection of the mutation at the molecular level confirms the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H26818156\" class=\"local\">'General approach to diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis in patients with disseminated NTM infections includes human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (EDID) due to mutations in NEMO, GATA2 deficiency, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), anti-IFN-gamma antibodies, or rarely, other T cell immunodeficiencies, such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). (See <a href=\"#H26818174\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive treatment with antimycobacterial antibiotics remains as the single accepted method for the management of patients with these disorders. Cytokine replacement therapy with IFN-gamma is an additional treatment option with most defects. However, it has limited efficacy among patients with autosomal recessive (AR) complete defects of IFN-gamma-R1 and IFN-gamma-R2 since unexpressed receptors lead to a failure to respond to IFN-gamma. (See <a href=\"#H26818180\" class=\"local\">'General approach to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1003552297\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge E Richard Stiehm, MD, who contributed as a Section Editor to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mendelian-susceptibility-to-mycobacterial-diseases-an-overview/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Al-Muhsen S, Casanova JL.
