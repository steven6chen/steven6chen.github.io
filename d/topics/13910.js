Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL (Ph+ ALL) is a biologically and clinically distinct variant of ALL classified as ALL with t(9;22)(q34;q11.2);BCR-ABL1 in the WHO classification system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Ph+ ALL accounts for approximately 20 to 30 percent of ALL in adults and 2 to 3 percent of ALL in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>When treated with chemotherapy alone, patients with Ph+ ALL have a uniformly poor prognosis with few survivors at five years after treatment. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) provides better results, curing approximately 30 to 60 percent of patients with Ph+ ALL. The incorporation of a BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a>) into the treatment regimen has resulted in superior response rates, thereby allowing more patients to proceed to allo-HCT. It is not yet known whether treatment with chemotherapy plus a tyrosine kinase inhibitor will provide durable long-term remissions and better survival than allo-HCT. The treatment of Ph+ ALL is distinct from that of other types of ALL and is comprised of several stages that, in total, may span three years of treatment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remission induction &ndash; Induction therapy aims to reduce the total body leukemia cell population from approximately 10<sup>12</sup> to below the cytologically detectable level of about 10<sup>9</sup> cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consolidation &ndash; Over 80 percent of adult patients with Ph+ ALL will attain a complete remission (CR) with induction chemotherapy that incorporates a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. However, without additional cytotoxic therapy, virtually all of these patients will relapse within a few weeks or months despite continuing a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In contrast, patients who receive post-remission therapy may expect five-year survival rates of 40 to 60 percent. Post-remission therapy includes an early allo-HCT or the continuation of chemotherapy plus a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance &ndash; Remission maintenance therapy, sometimes called continuation therapy, is a standard component of the management of non-Ph+ ALL and is generally given for two to three years after consolidation chemotherapy. Maintenance chemotherapy is not used after allo-HCT for most patients with ALL; however, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor may be offered as maintenance after allo-HCT to some patients who had Ph+ ALL.</p><p/><p>This topic review will discuss the treatment of Ph+ ALL in adults.

However, without additional cytotoxic therapy, virtually all of these patients will relapse within a few weeks or months. In contrast, patients who receive post-remission therapy may expect five-year survival rates of 40 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The primary aim of post-remission therapy, sometimes called consolidation or intensification, is to eradicate minimal residual disease. There are three basic options for post-remission therapy (in order of decreasing intensity): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allogeneic HCT &ndash; Allogeneic HCT targets cancer cells both by administering intensive and sometimes myeloablative chemotherapy and by harnessing a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. Treatment-related mortality is high on average (approximately 20 percent), but varies in individuals according to patient-related transplantation risk factors (eg, age, comorbid conditions). In addition, allogeneic HCT can result in significant morbidity associated with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), chronic cytopenias, second malignancies, cataracts, and sterility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Quality of life following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) &ndash; Autologous HCT allows the use of myeloablative chemotherapy and is not associated with GVHD, but does not provide the GVL effect seen with allogeneic HCT. Treatment-related morbidity and mortality are relatively low (&le;6 percent). One promising option is to perform auto-HCT in those who achieve a molecular remission following imatinib- or dasatinib-containing induction therapy. Individual long-term survivors have been described with this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consolidation and maintenance chemotherapy &ndash; Nonmyeloablative chemotherapy has a low treatment-related mortality rate (less than 5 percent). Common major side effects are generally short-term and include pancytopenia, infection, hepatic impairment, and neuropathy. Prior to the incorporation of TKIs, patients with Ph+ ALL had a uniformly poor prognosis with few survivors at five years after treatment with chemotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/7-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-14</a>].</p><p/><p>Most clinicians use a risk-adapted approach to determining the ideal post-remission therapy for a particular patient with ALL. Ph+ ALL has been categorically considered to be high risk ALL and numerous prospective trials demonstrated improved survival after allogeneic HCT when compared with autologous HCT or consolidation chemotherapy. &#160;</p><p>It remains possible that there are subtypes of Ph+ ALL with a more favorable outcome. As an example, Ph+ ALL patients who have no detectable disease by RT-PCR methods after initial chemotherapy have a more favorable outcome than those who remain positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. It is also unclear how the addition of TKIs to standard induction therapy may change the need for consolidation with HCT in patients with Ph+ ALL. As an example, pediatric studies have shown no advantage for allogeneic transplant over the combination of chemotherapy plus continuous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> in children who attain an early complete response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Since it is not yet known if a subset of adults exists that might be curable with chemotherapy plus imatinib or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a>, we continue to proceed, if possible, with allogeneic HCT for all patients with Ph+ ALL.</p><p>For patients with Ph+ ALL in first complete remission, we suggest a matched sibling HCT rather than consolidation chemotherapy or autologous HCT. In patients without an HLA-identical sibling, alternative donors (eg, matched unrelated donor, single antigen mismatched related donor, umbilical cord blood transplantation) should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The age at which transplant-related mortality exceeds the benefit gained from HCT is unclear and is likely to change as conditioning regimens and supportive care evolve. It is possible that this age may be as low as 35 to 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Older patients may be considered for reduced-intensity allogeneic HCT.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4420451\"><span class=\"h2\">Allogeneic HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is our preferred consolidation therapy for patients with Ph+ ALL in first complete remission (CR). The majority of studies that have evaluated this treatment approach were performed prior to the generalized incorporation of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) into the induction regimen, a modification that has clearly affected the feasibility of post-remission HCT. With TKI-based induction, more patients enter remission in good clinical condition and are thus candidates for a curative transplant procedure. Randomized studies are necessary to determine whether consolidation with allo-HCT still produces superior outcomes when compared with consolidation chemotherapy or autologous HCT. Until further data are available, proceeding with allogeneic HCT in first CR is supported by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several prospective trials performed prior to the use of TKIs that relied on a &ldquo;genetic randomization&rdquo; (patients were assigned to treatment with or without allogeneic HCT based upon the presence or absence of an HLA-matched sibling donor) reported significantly superior survival rates in patients assigned to allo-HCT when compared with those assigned to consolidation chemotherapy or autologous HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/11,18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,18,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-negative-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-remission therapy for Philadelphia chromosome negative acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Chemotherapy versus allogeneic transplant'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retrospective series performed both before and after the generalized incorporation of TKIs have demonstrated that patients with Ph+ ALL transplanted in first CR have superior outcomes when compared with those transplanted in second CR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]. This suggests that reserving allogeneic HCT for relapse is not the best option if the patient is an appropriate candidate. &#160; </p><p/><p>A single center retrospective analysis of 113 patients with Ph+ ALL who received an initial allogeneic HCT in first CR (63 percent), second CR (10 percent), or with active disease (27 percent) between 1990 and 2009 reported the following outcomes with a median follow-up of five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estimated progression-free survival (PFS) rates at two and five years post-HCT were 36 and 31 percent, respectively. PFS at five years was significantly better for patients treated in first CR than for those in second CR or those with progressive disease (42, 9, and 16 percent, respectively). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estimated overall survival (OS) rates at two and five years post-HCT were 44 and 33 percent, respectively.

There was no increased toxicity when a TKI was used around the time of transplant; however, the use of a TKI before <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> after HCT did not significantly affect PFS or OS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cumulative incidences of non-relapse mortality at 100 days, two years, and five years were 17, 35, and 39 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No patient experienced long-term survival following post-HCT relapse. Following relapse, the median survival was 4.2 months.</p><p/><p>These results demonstrate that allo-HCT is feasible in patients who have received a TKI-based induction regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. It is not clear how TKIs may be best incorporated into the consolidation and maintenance phases of treatment. </p><p>Perhaps the biggest benefit from TKIs in this setting is the greater likelihood that a patient will be able to proceed to allo-HCT in good clinical condition and with minimal residual disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This was best illustrated in an analysis of the prospective <span class=\"nowrap\">UKALLXII/ECOG2993</span> trial that compared the outcomes of 266 patients with Ph+ ALL treated without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> with those of 175 patients treated with the same induction chemotherapy in combination with imatinib as part of a protocol amendment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. All patients were expected to proceed with post-remission myeloablative allo-HCT if a related or unrelated donor was available. Results included the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> resulted in a higher CR rate (92 versus 82 percent) and superior overall survival at four years (38 versus 22 percent). Multivariate analysis suggested that a large part of the survival benefit seen with imatinib was due to a greater number proceeding with HCT (46 versus 31 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following imatinib-containing induction, post-remission therapy consisted of myeloablative allo-HCT (46 percent), non-protocol reduced intensity allo-HCT (3 percent), autologous HCT (4 percent), and consolidation chemotherapy (46 percent). When compared with consolidation chemotherapy, myeloablative allo-HCT resulted in superior overall survival at four years (50 versus 19 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the analysis was limited to patients who did not receive allo-HCT, estimated survival rates at four years were similar in those who did and did not receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> (21 versus 16 percent). &#160; </p><p/><p>These results support the continued use of allo-HCT in patients who receive a TKI-based induction regimen. This study did not provide information about the level of minimal residual disease prior to allo-HCT. Further studies are needed to determine whether allo-HCT can be omitted in a subset of patients with Ph+ ALL, such as those who achieve a rapid response with no detectable minimal residual disease. In addition, many patients continued <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> therapy after HCT, a practice that is likely to be important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83282352\"><span class=\"h2\">Autologous HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a paucity of data regarding the use of high dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (auto-HCT) in patients with Ph+ ALL treated with TKI-based induction therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Randomized trials in Ph negative ALL have reported that event-free and overall survival rates with auto-HCT are either similar or inferior to those obtained with consolidation chemotherapy. Although small numbers of patients with Ph+ ALL have been reported to achieve long term remission with this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], there are too few data to support its widespread use at this time.

Imatinib plus auto-HCT resulted in PCR negativity in nine patients and minimal positivity in four patients. Treatment-related mortality occurred in one (5 percent) and three (20 percent) patients undergoing auto-HCT and allo-HCT, respectively. Relapse rates were similar following auto-HCT and allo-HCT. When compared with allo-HCT, auto-HCT resulted in similar estimated rates of disease-free survival (median 3.5 versus 4.1 years) and overall survival (median six years versus not reached).</p><p>A report from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EGBMT) analyzed the outcomes of 177 adults with Ph+ ALL treated with auto-HCT in first complete remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Estimated rates of survival at three years increased serially with time of transplantation from 16 percent (1996 to 2001) to 57 percent (2007 to 2010). During this time period, there was an increase in leukemia-free survival (11 versus 52 percent), a decrease in relapse incidence (70 to 45 percent), and a decrease in non-relapse mortality (19 versus 3 percent). The improvement in disease control was attributed to the incorporation of TKIs into induction therapy. </p><p>These studies suggest that the incorporation of TKIs into induction therapy allows for the collection of stem cells uncontaminated by Ph+ ALL, thereby reducing the risk of relapse post-auto-HCT. The North American Leukemia Intergroup study CALGB 10701 (Alliance) is evaluating the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dasatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dasatinib</a> for remission induction followed by allo-HCT or auto-HCT in Ph+ ALL.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4420458\"><span class=\"h2\">TKI-based consolidation chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When treated with chemotherapy alone, patients with Ph+ ALL have a uniformly poor prognosis with few survivors at five years after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-remission-therapy-for-philadelphia-chromosome-positive-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-adults/abstract/7-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-14</a>].
