There are two HHV-6 variants, HHV-6A and HHV-6B. Based on their distinctive biological properties and genome sequences, the Herpesvirales Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has classified HHV-6A and HHV-6B as two distinct herpesvirus species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of HHV-6 infections in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients will be discussed here. HHV-6 infections in patients who are not HCT recipients are presented separately.

HHV-6B infects most children within the first three years of life and, like other herpesviruses, it establishes latency after primary infection. HHV-6B may reactivate in immunocompromised hosts, especially following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Encephalitis is the most clearly established clinical manifestation of HHV-6 reactivation in allogeneic HCT recipients and may result in substantial morbidity. Little is known about the epidemiology or clinical implications of HHV-6A.</p><p>The ubiquitous nature of HHV-6B and the fact that it causes latent infection complicate the ability to link disease with the virus. Further complicating this situation is the condition of inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6, an emerging aspect of HHV-6 biology that remains under study. (See <a href=\"#H1992448272\" class=\"local\">'Inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6'</a> below.)</p><p>HHV-6B reactivation occurs in 30 to 70 percent of patients undergoing allogeneic HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>], with encephalitis occurring in only a small subset of these patients. HHV-6 reactivation often manifests as HHV-6 viremia and typically occurs between two and four weeks after transplantation. HHV-6B accounts for most reactivations, with HHV-6A accounting for fewer than 3 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/4,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,8</a>]. It seems likely that previously reported cases in which HHV-6A was detected may actually represent inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6. (See <a href=\"#H358775122\" class=\"local\">'Detecting inherited chromosomal integration'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H642415572\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both demographic and clinical factors may influence the risk of HHV-6 reactivation. As an example, recipients of allogeneic HCT are at higher risk of HHV-6 reactivation than recipients of autologous HCT; among allogeneic HCT recipients, those who receive transplants from unrelated or human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched donors are at particularly increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/5,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9-11</a>].</p><p>The source of stem cells also influences the risk of reactivation; recipients of umbilical cord blood stem cells experience reactivation rates of 70 to 90 percent, compared with rates of 30 to 50 percent in recipients of peripheral blood or bone marrow stem cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Younger age and underlying disease have variably been identified as pre-transplantation risk factors for HHV-6 reactivation occurring after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>], whereas receipt of glucocorticoids has been identified as a post-transplantation risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/4,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9</a>]. Receipt of an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, BC3 (which targets T lymphocytes and has been used for prophylaxis against graft-versus-host disease), has also been associated with an increased risk of HHV-6 reactivation following transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In one study, myeloablative conditioning, umbilical cord blood transplantation, and male sex were independently associated with high-level HHV-6 reactivation (plasma HHV-6 DNA &ge;10<sup>4</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H642415580\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease associations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HHV-6 is associated with a number of important complications following HCT, including encephalitis and bone marrow suppression.

Taken together, these data support a causal association between HHV-6 infection and encephalitis in allogeneic HCT recipients.</p><p>One group has termed the encephalitis associated with HHV-6 in HCT recipients &quot;post-transplant acute limbic encephalitis,&quot; describing it as a distinct syndrome of anterograde amnesia, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, mild CSF pleocytosis, temporal electroencephalogram abnormalities often reflecting clinical or subclinical seizures, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) hyperintensities in the limbic system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The majority of reported HHV-6 encephalitis cases have occurred in recipients of unrelated HCT or HLA mismatched&ndash;related allogeneic HCT. Umbilical cord transplantation has also been identified as a risk factor for HHV-6 encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/6,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,20,21</a>]. In a study from the United States of 1344 allogeneic HCT recipients, the incidence of HHV-6 encephalitis was 1.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In a prospective study of 230 allogeneic HCT recipients in Japan, 7 patients (3.0 percent) developed HHV-6 encephalitis by day 70 following transplantation; encephalitis occurred more commonly in umbilical cord transplant recipients compared with recipients of other types of allografts (7.9 versus 1.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1376325798\"><span class=\"h3\">Delirium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the reports described above suggesting that HHV-6 can lead to encephalitis, several observational studies of HCT recipients have demonstrated associations between systemic HHV-6 reactivation and central nervous system dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/2,4,10,11,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,10,11,22</a>]. As an example, a study of 315 allogeneic HCT recipients demonstrated an independent association between HHV-6 reactivation and subsequent delirium, as indicated by neuropsychiatric screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. HHV-6 reactivation was also independently associated with subsequent neurocognitive decline at approximately three months after HCT, as measured by baseline and follow-up neurocognitive testing. An important limitation of this study is that a CSF sample was obtained from only 4 of 19 patients with delirium, 2 of whom had HHV-6 DNA detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, brain MRI was obtained in only 9 of 19 patients with delirium; none had the typical abnormalities associated with HHV-6 encephalitis. Since MRI and CSF HHV-6 PCR were not obtained in all patients with delirium, it is not possible to determine how many of the patients with delirium had HHV-6 encephalitis. This study suggests that HHV-6 may lead to central nervous system dysfunction in the absence of encephalitis, but further studies are necessary to prove this.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H642415594\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone marrow suppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies have suggested an association between HHV-6 reactivation and bone marrow suppression in HCT recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/2,4,5,23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5,23-27</a>]. In one study, in vitro assays demonstrated that HHV-6 inhibits granulocyte-macrophage and erythrocyte progenitors in human bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, HHV-6 has been shown to latently infect early bone marrow progenitors in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], and in vitro studies have demonstrated that HHV-6 infection of bone marrow progenitor cells suppresses the proliferation of granulocyte-macrophage, erythroid, and megakaryocyte cell lines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H642415615\"><span class=\"h3\">Other possible associations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other important clinical manifestations, such as acute graft-versus-host disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/4,31-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,31-39</a>] and cytomegalovirus reactivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/33,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,40,41</a>], have been associated with HHV-6 reactivation. However, these associations have not been consistently demonstrated, and potential pathways of pathogenesis are not well defined.</p><p>HHV-6 may cause pneumonitis in HCT recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/5,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,42-44</a>]. In a study of lung biopsy specimens from 15 HCT recipients with pneumonitis, high HHV-6 DNA levels in lung tissue were associated with idiopathic pneumonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Higher HHV-6 DNA levels were also correlated with severity of graft-versus-host disease. Another retrospective study tested for 28 pathogens in existing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from 69 HCT recipients with idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and 21 asymptomatic HCT recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. HHV-6 was detected in 20 (29 percent) patients with idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and was the most frequent pathogen detected. In contrast, HHV-6 was only detected in one asymptomatic control (5 percent). A limitation of this study is that all BAL samples from controls were obtained at least 31 days after transplantation, whereas 70 percent of the cases with idiopathic pneumonia syndrome had their BAL performed prior to day 31. In some patients with pneumonitis, immunohistochemical staining of lung tissue showed HHV-6 antigens without any other identifiable pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, the association with HHV-6 has been less certain in other reports because of the isolation of additional potential pathogens such as cytomegalovirus, <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em>, and adenovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. The role of HHV-6 as a pulmonary pathogen remains inconclusive, and further study is needed to document causality.</p><p>HHV-6 reactivation has been associated with an increased risk of mortality in HCT recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/4,31,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,31,33</a>]. However, it is not clear that the HHV-6 itself is the cause. In one study in which plasma samples were collected prospectively from 315 allogeneic HCT recipients and tested serially for HHV-6 DNA, HHV-6 reactivation (&gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span> was associated with non-relapse mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.3) and subsequent acute graft-versus-host disease (aHR 2.4, 95% CI 1.6-3.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Similarly, in another study of clinical outcomes in 100 allogeneic HCT recipients, HHV-6 reactivation was associated with an increased risk of aGVHD and all-cause mortality as well as a lower probability of monocyte engraftment (aHR 0.42, 95% CI 0.22-0.80) and platelet engraftment (aHR 0.47, 95% CI 0.21-1.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1992448272\"><span class=\"h2\">Inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 occurs when HHV-6A or HHV-6B integrates into germ-line cells, resulting in vertical transmission of chromosomally integrated HHV-6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Affected individuals have the HHV-6 genome integrated into a chromosome in every nucleated cell of their body, resulting in high levels of viral DNA in the blood and tissues in the absence of reactivation. Inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 is found in 1 to 2 percent of the population. Several studies in different settings have demonstrated the potential of the virus to reactivate from the integrated state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/50-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-55</a>]. However, the extent to which HCT recipients with integrated HHV-6 can also reactivate HHV-6 and suffer complications such as encephalitis is incompletely understood. At the very least, it may cause concern and confusion among clinicians when high viral levels are detected. There is some evidence that it is associated with certain complications of HCT. In one study, grade 2 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease was significantly more frequent when HCT recipients or donors had integrated HHV-6 (aHRs 1.7-1.9) and CMV viremia was significantly more common among recipients with integrated HHV-6 (aHRs 1.7-3.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In contrast, integrated HHV-6 status was not associated with an increased risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease, delayed hematopoietic cell engraftment, overall mortality, or non-relapse mortality. A well-documented case of active HHV-6A infection in a patient with severe combined immunodeficiency illustrates the potential for integrated HHV-6 to reactivate and cause disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Inherited chromosomal integration occurs when HHV-6 is integrated into a germ cell of an individual, and resulting offspring and subsequent generations have at least one copy of HHV-6 DNA in every cell of their body. Consequently, very high levels of HHV-6 DNA are detectable in blood and tissue samples of affected individuals.</p><p>Population-based studies have estimated chromosomally integrated HHV-6 to be present in about 1 percent of the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>].

Other herpesviruses, including Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus, may also cause viral encephalitis in the HCT setting, and CSF should be evaluated for these pathogens. JC virus, the cause of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, is an uncommon cause of encephalitis in HCT recipients, but this diagnosis should be considered in patients with a consistent clinical picture. Other viral pathogens, such as arboviruses, enteroviruses, and certain respiratory viruses (influenza, adenovirus, metapneumovirus), should be pursued depending on the season and exposure history.

Lung and brain imaging, along with microbiology studies of the CSF and blood, can assist in the identification of these infections. Although relatively rare, tuberculosis and parasitic infections, such as toxoplasmosis, should be considered, depending on whether the patient comes from an endemic region, whether there is a history of untreated latent tuberculosis, whether the pre-transplant <em>Toxoplasma</em> serology was positive, and whether the patient has been receiving prophylactic drugs with activity against <em>Toxoplasma</em> (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>).

Examples include electrolyte abnormalities and adverse effects from narcotics or benzodiazepines. Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, which is characterized by headaches, altered consciousness, visual disturbances, and seizures, can occur as a toxicity of calcineurin inhibitors; this diagnosis should be considered in patients with suggestive findings since calcineurin inhibitors are used in allogeneic HCT recipients to prevent GVHD.

Because serology is often negative in HCT recipients, direct detection of the virus is preferred.

However, PCR testing has not been standardized and it has, therefore, not been possible to develop cut-offs that are reliably predictive of disease, although evidence linking higher viral loads in the blood with encephalitis is accumulating (see <a href=\"#H1032076056\" class=\"local\">'Peripheral blood'</a> below). We prefer to use a quantitative PCR assay so that the viral load can be determined. This can be helpful for determining trends over time.

Based on these data, patients with high levels of HHV-6 DNA from the peripheral blood appear to be at greater risk for CNS dysfunction and HHV-6 encephalitis.</p><p>As noted above, in a study of 11 HCT recipients with HHV-6 detected by PCR in the CSF and serum (8 of whom had encephalitis) who were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">foscarnet</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a>, the levels of HHV-6 DNA in the serum became undetectable more quickly than in the CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Therefore, it is not adequate to rely on HHV-6 testing of the peripheral blood alone in an HCT recipient with signs and symptoms of encephalitis.</p><p>Inherited chromosomal integration of HHV-6 in the donor's cells or the recipient's cells can cause high concentrations of HHV-6 in the blood or CSF by PCR in the absence of active infection. This is discussed in greater detail below.

In contrast with PCR testing of plasma or serum specimens, approximately 60 percent of HCT patients will have positive tests for antigenemia prior to HCT. Following HCT, the proportion of patients with HHV-6 antigenemia increases to approximately 75 percent overall and is as high as 90 percent in recipients of allogeneic transplants from unrelated donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/27,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,96</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94538367\"><span class=\"h4\">Serology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic methods have many limitations, including the low sensitivity of antibody assays in severely immunocompromised patients. There are serologic approaches that incorporate antibody avidity, exploiting the fact that, during primary infection, the first immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies have low avidity but, with time and maturation of the immune response, higher avidity antibodies are produced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. This allows the immune response to primary infection to be distinguished from either maternal antibodies or antibodies of established infection. Although this may prove helpful in certain settings, primary HHV-6 infection is a concern for only a small fraction of HCT recipients, since most patients have been infected with HHV-6 prior to transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58480509\"><span class=\"h3\">Approach to diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any allogeneic HCT recipient with clinical findings suggestive of HHV-6 encephalitis (confusion, anterograde amnesia, short-term memory loss, seizures) should undergo lumbar puncture and MRI of the brain. A peripheral blood sample (eg, plasma) and a CSF sample should be tested for HHV-6 PCR in addition to routine studies (eg, cell count and differential, protein, glucose, Gram stain, aerobic culture). Other potential etiologies should be pursued. The diagnosis of HHV-6 encephalitis is established in allogeneic HCT recipients with the characteristic clinical findings in whom HHV-6 DNA is detected in the CSF without other causes identified. Chromosomal integration of HHV-6 can cause a false-positive HHV-6 PCR result in patients without evidence of encephalitis or other signs or symptoms attributable to HHV-6 disease. (See <a href=\"#H358775122\" class=\"local\">'Detecting inherited chromosomal integration'</a> below.)</p><p>If other causes of encephalitis are suspected, studies for other specific pathogens should be obtained (eg, herpes simplex virus PCR; varicella-zoster virus PCR; during the summer and fall, mosquito-borne viruses that cause encephalitis). (See <a href=\"#H13337663\" class=\"local\">'PCR'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13337382\" class=\"local\">'Imaging findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H709290668\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=viral-encephalitis-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Viral encephalitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>HHV-6 reactivation and higher levels of HHV-6 reactivation have been associated with encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, HHV-6 PCR from the peripheral blood can be helpful for establishing that HHV-6 reactivation has occurred and should be obtained when considering a diagnosis of HHV-6 encephalitis. However, detection of HHV-6 DNA in the blood alone is not predictive of HHV-6 encephalitis, since only a small proportion of patients with HHV-6 reactivation develop encephalitis. In addition, HHV-6 viral load may become undetectable in the blood before it resolves from CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Therefore, it is important to test not only the peripheral blood but also the CSF in patients with signs of encephalitis. (See <a href=\"#H764292630\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1032076056\" class=\"local\">'Peripheral blood'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H358775122\"><span class=\"h3\">Detecting inherited chromosomal integration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 can cause a confusing clinical picture in the setting of HCT. (See <a href=\"#H1992448272\" class=\"local\">'Inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6'</a> above.)</p><p>Population-based studies have estimated germ-line inheritance of HHV-6 to occur in about 1 percent of the population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. Thus, a small proportion of HCT donors and recipients will have inherited chromosomal integration. Because patients with inherited HHV-6 have at least one copy of the viral genome in each cell of their body, they have unusually high levels of HHV-6 DNA in blood, CSF, and tissues. Both HHV-6A and HHV-6B can be integrated and inherited. Since the vast majority, if not all, of reactivation events following HCT are due to HHV-6B, detection of HHV-6A can be a clue to chromosomally integrated HHV-6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/4,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,8</a>].</p><p>When the donor has inherited HHV-6, HHV-6 levels will increase in the recipient with engraftment and very high levels are often detected, particularly when whole blood is tested (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F83220\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83220 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. As an example, in one HCT recipient who received a transplant from a donor with chromosomal integration, persistent HHV-6 concentrations of 2.5 x10<sup>6</sup> to 10 x10<sup>6</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> were detected in whole blood following engraftment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In another report, two HCT recipients who received transplants from donors with chromosomal integration had 6.1 x10<sup>6</sup> and 9.7 x10<sup>5</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> in the whole blood following engraftment, but only 3600 and 15,400 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> in the plasma, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Other features of chromosomal integration in donor cells are that HHV-6 DNA levels remain persistently and stably elevated and do not decline with time or antiviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. Consequently, serial testing and quantification of HHV-6 DNA copies per cell assayed can provide evidence of inherited HHV-6 if more than one copy of HHV-6 per cell assayed is consistently detected over time.</p><p>In contrast with the pattern observed when the HCT recipient receives a transplant from a donor with chromosomal integration with HHV-6, when the HCT recipient has inherited HHV-6, high levels of HHV-6 DNA can be detected in the blood immediately after transplantation, which then decrease with successful engraftment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F83221\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83221 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>As noted above, high levels of HHV-6 DNA can also be detected in the CSF in individuals with chromosomal integration. As an example, among 21 patients with presumed chromosomal integration, HHV-6 DNA was detected in the CSF with a mean level of 4.0 log<sub>10</sub> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> (95% CI 3.5-4.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. This was higher than the mean level detected in immunocompetent children with primary HHV-6 infection (2.4 log<sub>10</sub> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL,</span> 95% CI 1.0-3.7), but similar to levels detected in HCT recipients with HHV-6 encephalitis.</p><p>Distinguishing inherited HHV-6 from HHV-6&ndash;associated disease can be challenging, especially when dealing with a single positive result. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with a specific HHV-6 probe performed on metaphase chromosome preparations from peripheral blood will demonstrate integrated HHV-6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/61,100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,100,101</a>]. In addition, in contrast with individuals with latent HHV-6 infection, individuals with integrated HHV-6 have detectable HHV-6 in their hair follicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. Thus, if FISH is not available, PCR testing of hair follicles for HHV-6 DNA can be performed to identify an individual with integrated HHV-6. This would mean testing the donor's hair follicles in the case of an HCT recipient whose donor is suspected to have integrated HHV-6. When there is concern for integrated HHV-6 in the HCT donor cells, testing of donor serum or whole blood with HHV-6 PCR may provide supporting evidence for integrated HHV-6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/62,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,102</a>]. A third option is use of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), an approach that provides precise quantitation of the ratio of HHV-6 to cellular DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. With this assay, inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 is accurately identified when cellular samples (eg, whole blood, buffy coat) are used, and the assay gives a ratio very close to 1 of <span class=\"nowrap\">HHV-6/cell</span>. This assay can also be used to identify reactivation of HHV-6B in a patient with chromosomally integrated HHV-6A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>The possibility of inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 should be considered in the setting of high and persistent levels of HHV-6 DNA in the peripheral blood, particularly if the patient has no clinical signs of encephalitis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the level of viremia does not decline following initiation of antiviral therapy with activity against HHV-6. It appears that HHV-6&ndash;related disease should not necessarily be ruled out on the basis of identifying chromosomally integrated HHV-6.

Although the expected response of the CSF HHV-6 viral load to antiviral therapy has not been clearly established, we treat patients who continue to have substantial neurologic deficits and who have not had a significant reduction in CSF HHV-6 levels for a longer period than patients who have both improved clinically and who have had a substantial reduction in the CSF HHV-6 viral load.</p><p>Optimally, we continue antiviral therapy until the peripheral blood HHV-6 PCR is undetectable (and for no fewer than 21 days). If there is an indication for rechecking the CSF HHV-6 viral load, then we continue antiviral therapy until it is undetectable as well. However, in the absence of clear improvement over an extended period (based on clinical response <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PCR results), prolonged treatment is unlikely to provide further benefit and may be toxic. One possible reason for a lack of virologic response is antiviral drug resistance (see <a href=\"#H665911113\" class=\"local\">'Antiviral therapy'</a> above).

These studies highlight the challenge of initiating preemptive therapy after a viral threshold has been reached but prior to the onset of manifestations of HHV-6 disease in high-risk patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H709290682\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcomes of HHV-6 encephalitis have been difficult to evaluate since allogeneic HCT recipients often have complex comorbidities. It appears that outcomes vary widely, with some patients recovering full neurologic function and other patients being left with residual neurologic deficits. Similarly, some patients with HHV-6 encephalitis have appeared to die from encephalitis, but many have died of other identifiable causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/15,17,18,82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17,18,82,83</a>].</p><p>In a review of case reports and case series of patients with HHV-6 encephalitis, information was provided on the neurologic course and outcomes in 44 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Although difficult to determine with certainty, 11 patients (25 percent) had a progressive course and died within one to four weeks of diagnosis. Eight patients (18 percent) improved but were left with residual neurologic compromise. Nineteen patients (43 percent) made a full recovery, although, for some, the recovery process lasted several weeks and required rehabilitation services. Six patients (14 percent) initially showed improvement but then succumbed to respiratory failure, multiorgan failure, or other documented infections. Whether these conditions were directly or indirectly a result of the HHV-6 infection remains unclear. Similar observations were made in a surveillance study of HHV-6 encephalitis in HCT recipients in Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>In a series of nine patients, two patients developed relapse or a second episode of encephalitis two to three months after treatment of the initial episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Long-term neurocognitive outcomes associated with HHV-6 reactivation have not been evaluated. In a retrospective study of patients with HHV-6 encephalitis who were followed for a median of 1651 days following development of encephalitis, 121 were evaluated for CNS dysfunction after completing antiviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Of these, 69 (57 percent) were found to have persistent neuropsychologic dysfunction. The most common sequela was memory impairment (in 33 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H358775535\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF OTHER ENTITIES POTENTIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH HHV-6</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recommendations do not exist for the treatment of clinical entities other than encephalitis that may be associated with human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) reactivation, such as bone marrow suppression or delayed engraftment.

(See <a href=\"#H764292630\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small subset of allogeneic HCT recipients with HHV-6 reactivation develops HHV-6 encephalitis, characterized by confusion and short-term memory loss <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anterograde amnesia with or without seizures. In such patients, HHV-6 DNA is usually detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often shows hyperintensities in the medial temporal lobes. (See <a href=\"#H764292630\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H709290654\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that HCT recipients who develop signs of encephalitis, especially during the first several weeks after transplantation, undergo lumbar puncture to have their CSF tested for HHV-6 using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as for routine CSF studies and for other possible infectious agents. Such patients should also have peripheral blood (eg, plasma) tested using quantitative HHV-6 PCR and should undergo MRI to look for evidence of limbic encephalitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F83215\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83215 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F83216\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83216 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77735\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77735 \">image 3</a>). The diagnosis of HHV-6 encephalitis is established in allogeneic HCT recipients with the characteristic clinical findings in whom HHV-6 DNA is detected in the CSF without other causes identified.

We give antiviral therapy for 21 days for most patients with HHV-6 encephalitis, particularly those who have had a good clinical response to therapy. Patients who have had a poor clinical response <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in whom the CSF or peripheral blood HHV-6 remains detectable should be treated for a longer period. In patients who require a longer duration of antiviral therapy but who are experiencing toxicity, the class of antiviral agent can be changed. (See <a href=\"#H709290675\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important toxicities of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">foscarnet</a> include nephrotoxicity and electrolyte depletion; prehydration and close monitoring of electrolytes are warranted when foscarnet is given. An important toxicity of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> is bone marrow suppression. (See <a href=\"#H709290675\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recheck the HHV-6 viral load from the peripheral blood weekly during therapy until it has become undetectable. We recheck the CSF HHV-6 viral load in patients who have not improved or who have worsened clinically despite appropriate antiviral therapy. (See <a href=\"#H642415887\" class=\"local\">'Duration and monitoring during therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with HHV-6 encephalitis who have subtle signs that are suggestive of seizure activity should undergo an electroencephalogram (EEG). In patients with clinical or EEG evidence of seizure activity, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a>.
