Most cases are caused by a heterozygous chromosomal deletion at 22q11.2. The classic triad of features of DGS on presentation is conotruncal cardiac anomalies, hypoplastic thymus, and hypocalcemia (resulting from parathyroid hypoplasia).</p><p>Thymic hypoplasia in DGS results in a range of T cell deficits. The majority of patients with DGS have mild defects in T cell numbers and are not clinically immunodeficient. However, there is a continuous spectrum of T cell lymphopenia, and approximately 0.5 to 1 percent of DGS cases have a complete absence of thymic tissue and profound immunodeficiency. This form of DGS, called complete DGS, is a type of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and is life-threatening if not corrected with immune reconstitution (eg, thymic transplantation or hematopoietic cell transplantation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology and pathogenesis of DGS. The clinical features, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of patients with DGS are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;DiGeorge (22q11.2 deletion) syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;DiGeorge (22q11.2 deletion) syndrome: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of DGS were first described in 1829, and congenital absence of the thymus and parathyroid glands was reported by Dr. Angelo DiGeorge in 1965 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the 1980s, it was discovered that deletions in chromosome 22q11.2 were present in most patients with DGS, as well as in patients with other similar syndromes, such as velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS, also called Shprintzen syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>Thus, these conditions can be grouped together under the term chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS). Patients with the DiGeorge phenotype and the chromosome 22q11.2 deletion are most precisely referred to as having &quot;DGS with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion,&quot; and those with other mutations are referred to as having &quot;DGS without chromosome 22q11.2 deletion&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Other syndromes associated with deletions in chromosome 22q11.2 are mentioned briefly and reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syndromes with craniofacial abnormalities&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23490524\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A large population-based study in the United States designed to ascertain the prevalence, phenotype, and incidence of cardiac disease revealed that chromosome 22q11.2 deletions are relatively common in the general population, making 22qDS the most prevalent microdeletion syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This study found that 1 in 5950 live births had a deletion in this chromosomal area, and, within this subset of infants, 83 percent had an associated cardiac defect. Other population studies have reported the incidence of 22qDS to be as high as 1 in 4000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. 22qDS is probably underdiagnosed because the phenotypic findings may be mild in some patients. One report noted that African-American children with 22qDS may have a lower incidence of craniofacial dysmorphism, making diagnosis more challenging in this group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Two subsequent multicenter studies aimed at prenatal population-based genetic screening found that the incidence for 22qDS was considerably higher than postnatal population-based studies, with prevalences as high as approximately 1 in 400 in low-risk pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The signs and symptoms associated with DGS result from an abnormal development sequence in the embryonic pharyngeal system. This is a vertebrate-specific system that consists of the pharyngeal arches (comprised of mesoderm and neural crest cells), through which the pharyngeal arteries and nerves pass. The arches are separated by the pharyngeal pouches, which are internal evaginations of foregut endoderm and external invaginations of surface ectoderm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F75948\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75948 \">figure 1</a>). This developmental sequence contributes to the formation and morphogenesis of the thymus, thyroid, parathyroids, maxilla, mandible, aortic arch, cardiac outflow tract, and <span class=\"nowrap\">external/middle</span> ear. The majority of cases have identifiable genetic causes. However, various teratogens have been independently associated with DGS in humans and animal models, such as maternal exposure to alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>] and retinoic acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and maternal diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 90 percent of patients with DGS have heterozygous deletions in chromosome 22q11.2 (designated the DGS1 locus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The inheritance of 22qDS is autosomal dominant, but the majority of cases are the result of de novo microdeletions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. The high incidence of chromosome 22q11.2 microdeletions is attributed to the presence of homologous enrichment of low copy repeats (LCRs) in two areas of this chromosomal region, which make it prone to homologous recombination deletion errors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], leading to copy number variants (CNVs) in the chromosome 22q11.2 region. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genomic-disorders-an-overview#H12440911\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genomic disorders: An overview&quot;, section on 'Causes of CNVs'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Chromosome 22q11.2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common genetic deletion associated with DGS is a 1.5 to 3.0 Mb deletion in the chromosome 22q11.2 region (DGS1 locus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This region of genomic DNA encodes approximately 30 genes (24 genes within the 1.5 Mb region) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F65172\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65172 \">figure 2</a>). DGS is most commonly caused by heterozygous deletions in this region, although several cases of a DGS-like phenotype have been reported in association with duplications of the 22q11.2 region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Homozygous deletions in chromosome 22q11.2 have not been reported.</p><p>Several studies in humans have attempted to identify genes in the critical DGS 3 Mb region that are essential for the phenotype. An initial report studying 350 patients for defects within the DGS 3 Mb region found that patients with conotruncal heart defects and typical DGS phenotype most commonly had a nested 1.5 Mb deletion (79 percent) or the larger 3 Mb deletion (19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The size of the deletion did not correlate with the clinical phenotype. Other deletions (called atypical deletions) in the DGS critical region were found in only 5 percent of patients, and these individuals had phenotypes only mildly suggestive of DGS without conotruncal cardiac disease. None of these deletions were found in normal controls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1350062266\"><span class=\"h4\">TBX1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A region of mouse chromosome 16 is highly syntenic to the human chromosome 22q11.2 region and has been experimentally deleted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Mice heterozygous for this deletion had phenotypic abnormalities similar to DGS, namely cardiac, thymic, parathyroid, and neurobehavioral phenotypic abnormalities. Smaller deletions also resulted in a similar phenotype, leading to the question of whether DGS could result from a single gene defect. Subsequent studies in the mouse demonstrated that deletion of the gene for a T-box transcription factor (<em>TBX1)</em> encoded within this chromosomal region was sufficient to convey all of the exhibited phenotypic abnormalities of the larger genomic deletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. Mice that are heterozygous for the <em>TBX1</em> deletion have aortic arch abnormalities only, whereas homozygous null mutations in <em>TBX1</em> lead to a complete DGS-like phenotype, illustrating the importance of gene dose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-molecular-genetics#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of molecular genetics&quot;, section on 'RNA transcription'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H5815068\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;DiGeorge (22q11.2 deletion) syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Complete DGS'</a>.)</p><p>To investigate the role of the transcription factor Tbx1 in humans, genetic screening was undertaken in 13 patients with the DGS phenotype but without detectable deletions in the defined 1.5-3 Mb region of chromosome 22q11.2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Three point mutations in the gene encoding Tbx1 (<em>TBX1</em>) were demonstrated in three unrelated patients but were not found in a survey of healthy controls. These three individuals manifested all of the major phenotypes of DGS, including facial abnormalities, cardiac abnormalities, thymic hypoplasia, palatal abnormalities, and parathyroid dysfunction. These data strongly suggest that defects in the gene for Tbx1 also are responsible for the DGS phenotype in humans.</p><p><em>TBX1</em> mutations in a zebrafish model, called the van gogh (vgo) mutation, cause many of the features of DGS, including defects in the ear, pharyngeal arches, aortic arches, and thymus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The vgo mutant is recessive. Heterozygous embryos do not demonstrate a DGS phenotype.</p><p>The zebrafish model also provided insight into the fundamental nature of interactions between endoderm, mesoderm, and neural crest cells in the development of the pharyngeal arch system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Expression analysis revealed that Tbx1 is expressed in the pharyngeal endoderm and the mesenchyme surrounding the aortic arches and the otic vesicle, although not in the neural crest cells. Transplantation of wild-type endoderm into vgo mutants corrected the DGS-like phenotype. Thus, vgo cells function autonomously in the pharyngeal arch system, and neural crest defects are secondary to this molecular defect. Studies using the zebrafish model have extended this initial work and suggest that Tbx1 expression in the mesoderm is necessary for development of the pharyngeal arch system, whereas Tbx1<em> </em>expression in the endoderm was dispensable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Mesoderm-specific deletion of <em>TBX1 </em>in mice resulted in pharyngeal and cardiac abnormalities, providing evidence in mammals that mesodermal Tbx1 expression is necessary for these developmental sequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The genes regulated by Tbx1 remain poorly understood. One study in a murine model demonstrated that Tbx1 regulates the expression of forkhead box N1 (Foxn1) and thus the development of thymic epithelial cells and thymopoiesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Other studies in mice and zebrafish have demonstrated that retinoic acid exposure can downregulate the cellular levels of Tbx1, leading to developmental abnormalities similar to the DGS phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. This finding may provide a molecular basis for the association between DGS phenotype and in utero exposure to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isotretinoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isotretinoin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3942157571\"><span class=\"h4\">Other affected genes in this region</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the strong evidence implicating <em>TBX1</em> defects in the DGS phenotype, other genes or gene dosage probably play a role in the observed phenotypic variability.</p><p>Studies in mice and zebrafish demonstrated that Tbx1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) interact with and comodify pharyngeal arch vascular defects during embryogenesis, and human studies suggest that <em>VEGF</em> promoter polymorphisms modify cardiovascular disease in 22q11.2 microdeletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Deletion of Crkl (V-CRK avian sarcoma virus CT10 oncogene homolog-like) in mice results in neurologic and cardiac defects similar to those observed in human 22q11.2 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Two case reports described children with congenital cardiac defects and microcephaly who had partial deletion of the critical area of chromosome 22q11 leading to deletions in <em>CRKL</em> with unaffected <em>TBX1 </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. In another study, a higher frequency of heterozygous deletions in the DGS1 locus was seen in patients with congenital kidney and urinary tract defects compared with general population controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Next-generation sequencing of suspect DGS1 kidney defect genes demonstrated heterozygous mutations in <em>CRKL </em>predicted to be damaging in an additional five patients. Induced loss-of-function Crkl mutants in zebrafish results in renal defects, and inactivation in mice induced developmental renal anomalies. These results suggest that haploinsufficiency of <em>CRKL</em> is the genetic driver of renal defects seen in patients with DGS and is also the cause of some cases of sporadic congenital kidney and urinary tract anomalies.</p><p>Regarding gene dosage, one study showed decreased expression of several genes in DGS critical region in peripheral blood cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. This included decreased expression of <em>DGCR8</em> (DiGeorge critical region gene 8), a regulator of microribonucleic acid (miRNA) biogenesis. Variably decreased levels of numerous miRNAs were seen in DGS subjects that correlated with several phenotypic features. Thus, these data suggest a complex network of varied gene expression secondary to altered gene dosage in chromosome 22qDS and the potential for development of biomarkers for disease prognosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Defects on other chromosomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 2 to 5 percent of patients have heterozygous deletions in chromosome 10p13-14 (the DGS2 locus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Comparison of patients with DGS1 and DGS2 locus deletions demonstrate many similarities, although there is an increased incidence of sensorineural hearing loss in patients with the DGS2 locus deletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. There also have been isolated case reports of patients with phenotypic features of DGS and a microdeletion in chromosome 17 or an isochromosome 18q [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p>Mutations in the <em>CHD7</em> (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7) gene, located at 8q12.2, that encodes the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 are found in approximately 70 percent of patients with CHARGE (coloboma of the eye, heart anomalies, choanal atresia, retardation, genital and ear anomalies) syndrome association. Several groups have described patients with CHD7 mutations who have the DGS phenotype along with the other unique features of CHARGE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/47-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5814537\"><span class=\"h2\">Thymic hypoplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A spectrum of thymic abnormalities is possible in DGS. In one study, 39 of 43 patients with DGS who had a detectable thymus on ultrasound had decreased thymic tissue volume compared with age-matched healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The majority of patients have sufficient thymic tissue for the development of functional T cells. Complete absence of thymic tissue, which defines &quot;complete&quot; DGS, is rare in patients with DGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Immune function'</a> below.)</p><p>The precise nature of the thymic abnormalities in DGS patients is not entirely clear. One theory is that the T cell defects observed are secondary to an insufficient amount of thymic tissue that is otherwise functioning normally and is located in the normal anatomic location. However, undescended, morphologically small thymi were found on autopsies of patients with DGS in whom the cause of death was not immunologically related [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p>A second theory proposes that the T cell defects in DGS are due to an abnormal anatomic location of the thymus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. This theory is better substantiated by clinical studies. One study of 14 patients with DGS undergoing cardiac surgery revealed ectopic thymic tissue, most commonly in the neck, in 11 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. However, only two patients were immunodeficient. Another study found no difference in the correlation between recent thymic emigrant T cells and T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) values in patients with ectopic thymic tissue compared with those patients whose thymus was in the expected anatomic location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

Partial DGS describes the majority of patients, who have variable and non-life-threatening immunologic defects. In contrast, complete DGS is fatal within the first year of life, unless detected promptly and treated with immunologic reconstitution. It is believed that a total absence of thymic tissue is responsible for the complete DGS phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The identified genetic defects underlying complete DGS are similar to partial DGS, albeit with varied distribution between the two, suggesting that additional complementary genetic <span class=\"nowrap\">defects/polymorphisms</span> or environmental factors are responsible for the more severe immunologic manifestations.

Peripheral blood CD3+ T cells typically comprise &lt;1 to 2 percent of the circulating lymphocytes (or absolute values &lt;50 CD3+ T <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span>.

Development of some T cells over weeks or months has been reported in a subset of athymic patients. The circulating T cells in these patients have abnormal T cell receptors (specifically, a restricted variable beta T cell receptor [V beta TCR] repertoire) and are functionally defective in vitro, demonstrating extrathymic outgrowth of an oligoclonal abnormal T cell population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/52,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,58</a>].

In normal neonates, T cell counts decline rapidly in the first year of life and then decline further at a slower rate. In contrast, in infants with partial DGS, T cell numbers are initially low and then may rise slightly during the first year. Several prospective studies have demonstrated that the normal attrition of T cell numbers that occurs with age is blunted in DGS patients and may result in normal T cell numbers by adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/59-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-63</a>]. Normalization appears to result from homeostatic proliferation of existing T cells, rather than from thymus recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/60,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,64</a>].</p><p>Thymically derived CD25+ T regulatory cells are an important T cell subset in suppressing autoimmune diseases. Diminished numbers of these cells are found in patients with 22qDS after two years of age compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. This finding may be a factor in the increased incidence of autoimmune and atopic disease seen in patients with DGS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H7568451\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;DiGeorge (22q11.2 deletion) syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Other immune-related problems'</a>.)</p><p>T cell function is variable, with the majority of patients having relatively intact function. The response to mitogens is normal for the majority of patients with partial DGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Mitogen response in patients with low T cell numbers (below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile of normal range) can be abnormal by standard methods, although this probably represents a quantitative defect as opposed to intrinsic T cell dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. In one study, the T cell proliferative response to mitogens was comparable with controls, but the response to specific antigens was variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In another study, proliferative responses to <em>Candida</em> and tetanus were significantly lower in a subset of patients with partial DGS compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The majority of these patients with partial DGS also had T cell numbers below the 10<sup>th</sup> percentile of normal range.</p><p>B cells are usually normal or increased in number and mildly abnormal in function, consistent with defective T cell help [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Although total B cell numbers are normal, the proportion of memory B cells is lower in patients with 22q11.2 deletions, particularly in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/61,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,66</a>]. A DGS registry reported use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy in 3 percent of patients with DGS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. More in-depth studies are necessary to understand the significance of memory B cell abnormalities and indications for immune globulin replacement therapy in patients with partial DGS.</p><p>Natural killer cells are typically normal in number and function in patients with 22qDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/digeorge-22q11-2-deletion-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS), which includes DiGeorge syndrome (DGS), is the most prevalent microdeletion syndrome. 22qDS is probably underdiagnosed because the phenotypic findings may be very mild in some patients. (See <a href=\"#H23490524\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DGS is a constellation of signs and symptoms associated with defective development of the pharyngeal pouches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F75948\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75948 \">figure 1</a>). These embryologic structures give rise to the thymus, thyroid, parathyroids, maxilla, mandible, aortic arch, cardiac outflow tract, and <span class=\"nowrap\">external/middle</span> ear. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 90 percent of patients with DGS have spontaneously arising heterozygous deletions in chromosome 22q11.2 (termed DGS1) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F65172\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65172 \">figure 2</a>). Defects in the T-box transcription factor 1 gene (<em>TBX1</em>) are central to the phenotype. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Genetic abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinically, patients with DGS are divided into two subtypes, partial or complete DGS, based upon the level of immunologic function and degree of thymic hypoplasia. Partial DGS refers to the majority of patients, who have variable and non-life-threatening immunologic defects. Complete DGS is a form of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), in which there is no thymic tissue and profound immunodeficiency. (See <a href=\"#H5814537\" class=\"local\">'Thymic hypoplasia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Immune function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The thymus is completely absent, and peripheral blood CD3+ T cells typically comprise &lt;1 to 2 percent of the circulating lymphocytes in patients with complete DGS. These patients are profoundly immunosuppressed, and the condition is fatal if not recognized and treated with thymic or bone marrow transplant. (See <a href=\"#H665093\" class=\"local\">'Complete DGS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infants with partial DGS demonstrate variable T cell counts and function.
