Prosthetic materials in the surgical management of specific conditions are discussed in individual topic reviews.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">USE OF RECONSTRUCTIVE MATERIALS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hernia repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of prosthetic material dramatically reduces the incidence of recurrence associated with ventral, inguinal, and femoral hernia repair. Polypropylene is the most common material used.

Advantages and disadvantages of the different material types are found in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72868\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72868 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Synthetic materials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Synthetic materials are available as both absorbable (eg, polygalactin 910 [Vicryl], polyglycolic acid [Dexon]) and nonabsorbable mesh (eg, polypropylene [Marlex, Prolene], and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene [ePTFE, Gore-tex]). Compared with biologic grafts, advantages of synthetic materials include greater availability (does not require harvesting) and lower cost of material. However, infectious and erosion complications, especially with transvaginal surgery, have prompted a search for alternative materials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Host response'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Autografts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autograft materials are harvested from the patient who is undergoing the procedure. Tensor fascia lata and rectus fascia, the most commonly used autografts, have been used for decades and yield predicable results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A clear advantage of autografts is that the host response is rarely problematic. However, use of autografts is limited by morbidity associated with harvesting the tissue (eg, pain, bleeding, infection, hernia formation), as well as inconsistent size, quantity, and quality of tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Host response'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Allografts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allografts are processed cadaveric fascia lata or acellular dermal matrices (ADM) of human donors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63852\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63852 \">table 2</a>). The material is decellularized and rendered nonimmunogenic by washing processes, which are designed to remove cellular debris without permanently damaging the connective tissue scaffold.</p><p>Although tissue banks in North America are accredited through the National Association of Tissue Banks, evidence-based comparisons among allografts distributed by different companies are difficult because the harvesting, processing, and preservation of these materials are varied and proprietary. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Allograft processing'</a> below.)</p><p>Human donors of allografts are screened for blood-borne pathogens; those with risk factors or who test positive for HIV, syphilis, HTLV, or hepatitis B or C are excluded. There have been no reported cases of donor-related viral infection associated with the use of allografts.</p><p>Use of this class of materials eliminates the morbidity associated with autologous fascia harvest. However, allografts have consistently underperformed compared with autologous fascia and synthetic materials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Xenografts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Xenografts are acellular extracts of collagen from nonhuman sources, harvested with or without additional extracellular matrix components (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73182\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73182 \">table 3</a>). They differ in the source species (bovine or porcine), site of harvest (pericardium, dermis, or small intestine submucosa), and by whether or not chemical crosslinking is used in the processing of the material [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>It is not clear whether architectural differences due to harvest site (eg, dermis with high elastin content versus intestinal submucosa with no elastin content) affects in vivo performance.</p><p>Some patients may object to use of porcine or bovine implants due to religious or cultural issues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">HOST RESPONSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histologic behavior to a class of material depends upon the physical and structural properties of the prosthesis. The type of host response is a key determinant of synthetic mesh related complications. As an example, among patients undergoing a sacrocolpopexy, the risk of mesh exposure was 4.2 times greater for those who had polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) compared to those that used non-PTFE mesh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Terminology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Host response to reconstructive materials is described by varying terminology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], as an example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incorporation: graft infiltration by host cells, allowing neovascularization and collagen deposition throughout the material</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encapsulation: collagen and connective tissue deposit at the periphery of the material, rather than infiltration of graft by host cells</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed response: incorporation occurs at graft pores and encapsulation occurs around the remaining material</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resorption: material is replaced by host neo-connective tissue</p><p/><p>Theoretically, materials that undergo encapsulation or mixed response are at increased risk of infection and erosion. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> below.)</p><p>The key factor(s) for host response to each type of material are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synthetic mesh: fiber diameter, pore size, and weave or knit type</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autografts: autologous tissue, host response is rarely problematic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allografts: key factor(s) have not been elucidated</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Xenografts: removal of host cellular components and chemically crosslinking</p><p/><p>The International Urogynecological Association (IUGA) and the International Continence Society (ICS) have published a Joint Terminology and Classification Report on mesh-related complications that classifies the event based upon category (asymptomatic, symptomatic, infection with or without abscess), location (vagina, urinary tract, bowel, skin or patient compromise), and timing since implantation (within 48 hours of surgery, until 6 months and beyond 6 months from surgery). Clinically, prosthetic material-related complications are manifested as exposures (mesh fibers protruding into the lumen of the vaginal or surrounding organs), mesh contraction or prominence (the wrinkling or shrinkage of the material projecting beyond the surface of the epithelium), infection (including sinus tract formation and abscess), bowel or bladder injury, or bleeding complications and systemic compromise. It is rare to have an infected, unexposed material. In some locations, such as the vagina, it is difficult to differentiate between infection and colonization, and clinical signs of infection are necessary to make the diagnosis. Furthermore, it is unclear whether these clinical manifestations are due to host response or technical aspects of material use (eg, thickness of vaginal flaps).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Synthetic materials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Host response to synthetic prosthetic materials depends on several factors: absorbability, pore size (space between fibrils), weave or knit (mono- or multifilament), and weight (mass per surface area mesh).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Absorbable versus nonabsorbable</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both absorbable and nonabsorbable materials cause initial and chronic inflammatory tissue responses after they are implanted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The quantity and quality of local inflammation depend directly on the specific material used.</p><p>The implantation of absorbable material (eg, polygalactin 910 [Vicryl] or polyglycolic acid [Dexon]) elicits a chronic foreign body reaction and promotes fibroblast activity. After complete absorption (30 days for polygalactin 910; 90 days for polyglycolic acid), the prosthetic material is replaced by a collagen-rich connective tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Absorbable materials are less likely to become infected than nonabsorbable materials, and are less harmful to viscera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. One disadvantage to absorbable implants, based on animal studies, is that the resultant scar tissue weakens after the material is absorbed, and therefore may not provide the necessary long-term repair strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Nonabsorbable prosthetic materials (eg, polypropylene [Prolene, Marlex]) are associated with more connective tissue reaction than absorbable materials. Thus, repair strength is increased due to the continuing presence of the implant and greater scar formation.</p><p>Partially absorbable materials have been developed, with the aim of decreasing the amount of permanent foreign material while maintaining mechanical resistance. These materials are composites of absorbable and nonabsorbable materials (eg, polypropylene with polygalactin [Vypro] or with poliglecaprone-25 [Ultrapro]) and are lightweight; few reports are available regarding clinical performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]&nbsp;(see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Weight'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Pore size and weave</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pore size influences cellular infiltration, risk of infection, tendency to form adhesions, and mesh density and flexibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Macropores (&gt;75 microns; 1 mm = 1000 microns) allow for host cell colonization with collagen deposition and angiogenesis, although this has only been reported in animal studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In addition, in vivo evidence suggests that the large pore allows unrestricted immune cell access and minimizes the risk of infection.</p><p>Micropores (&lt;10 microns) result in restriction of fibroblast and immune cell colonization to the material surface (eg, PTFE). Therefore, collagen and connective tissue deposition occurs at the periphery, rather than infiltration by host cells, according to animal data. This process is called encapsulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In addition, microporous materials are at increased risk of becoming infected, as large immune cells (macrophages and natural killer cells, mean diameter 9 to 20 microns) cannot infiltrate the interstices (space between fibers) to phagocytose bacteria (&lt;1 micron) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Weight</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mesh weight, or density, is another descriptor for synthetic materials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78709\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78709 \">figure 1</a>). Generally speaking, the weight is a measure of how much material is present per square meter.</p><p>Weight and elasticity are determined by pore size. Meshes with larger pores generally have a lower weight and are more elastic compared with those that have smaller pores. The larger the pores, the less material content and the more flexible the elicited scar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. It has been postulated that light-weight materials may be less prone to infection or erosion than heavy-weight materials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonabsorbable synthetic materials are generally described by type, a classification based on pore size and weave (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78709\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78709 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. There are four types (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78709\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78709 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I &ndash; Macroporous (&gt;75 microns), monofilament polypropylene (eg, Prolene, Marlex). Type I meshes are further subdivided into heavy-, mid-, and light-weight materials.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II &ndash; Microporous (&lt;10 microns), eg, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (eg, Gore-tex).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type III &ndash; Macroporous (&gt;75 microns) grafts with either microporous components or multifilament fiber structure, eg, polyethylene [Mersilene]. Histologic behavior is similar to Type II materials. This category includes some polypropylene materials, eg, ObTape (heat bonded, heat welded polypropylene with microporous components) and IVS Tunneler (multifilament polypropylene). Both materials have been associated with increased rates of infections and erosion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]; OBTape has been removed from the market and IVS Tunneler is not being marketed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type IV &ndash; Submicroscopic pore size (eg, polypropylene sheet [Cellgard]). These are not commonly used in gynecologic surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Allograft processing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allograft processing is intended to render a graft nonimmunogenic. As mentioned above, the methods used by companies to process human tissue to produce allografts vary and details are not publicly disclosed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63852\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63852 \">table 2</a>), thereby interfering with evidence-based comparisons among allografts.</p><p>There are at least four major steps in allograft processing:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Harvesting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Harvesting of fascia lata and dermis is done aseptically from cadavers. For dermis products, the epidermis is mechanically or chemically separated from the underlying dermis; the collagen matrix is then extracted from the dermis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Host cell removal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After harvesting, the material is made acellular by washing it in a solution to extract cellular components. These processes render the allograft nonimmunogenic by eliminating cell surface proteins (eg, human histocompatibility antigen, HLA) and sugar moieties. The solvents must remove cellular debris without permanently denaturing the protein scaffold.</p><p>Despite assertions by manufacturers, it appears that the cellular extraction process is imperfect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In one study, the HLA type of allograft donors could still be identified (using the polymerase chain reaction) in freeze-dried and Tutoplast processed grafts; Repliform interfered with the assay in the study and its antigenicity could not be determined. These data suggest that not all contaminating DNA had been extracted. However, this finding does not signify that the grafts were immunogenic. Host rejection is mediated by host lymphocyte detection of cell surface proteins and sugar moieties, not by DNA or other intracellular components.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Preservation and sterilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The collagen and extracellular matrix are preserved via lyophilization (freeze-dried under vacuum) or solvent dehydration. In some tissue banks, the graft is then terminally sterilized (usually with gamma irradiation).</p><p>The processes employed for these steps appear to affect the final graft strength. As an example, the rate of lyophilization alters the size of ice crystal formation (the more ice crystals formed, the weaker the final product) and the terminal sterilization temperature influences the degree of free radical formation.</p><p>Both lyophilization and sterilization affect the final integrity of the material and, theoretically, graft performance. However, the effect of preimplantation biomechanical characteristics of a graft on in vivo behavior is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/7,22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,22-26</a>]. No data on postimplantation biomechanical testing exist for allografts; it appears that preimplantation mechanical testing does not predict in vivo behavior of xenografts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In fact, the few studies which have compared different allografts by preimplantation strength are not consistent with reports of clinical performance. As an example, one study reported that the preimplantation maximum load to failure (minimum force needed to tear the tissue) and stiffness were significantly higher for solvent dehydrated compared with freeze-dried fascia lata [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Nevertheless, solvent dehydrated allografts have consistently been reported to result in early failure after pubovaginal sling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], sacrocolpopexy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and vaginal reinforced repairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Similarly, the only study which evaluated vaginal repair with a freeze-dried graft reported a high failure rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Xenograft processing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to allografts, xenografts processing includes harvesting, host cell removal, preservation and sterilization. These processes are generally proprietary, and thus comparisons among different grafts are difficult. In our experience, some patients have had increased tissue reaction with xenografts, raising concerns about how well the processes remove cellular debris. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Allograft processing'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition, xenografts undergo chemical crosslinking, which is one of the key determinants of host response to xenografts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73182\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73182 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Crosslinking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noncrosslinked xenografts (eg, Surgisis, Xenform) are purported to serve as biologic scaffolding for fibroblast and angioblast ingrowth; they are replaced by host connective tissue at varying rates, depending on material thickness, method of freezing, and site of implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Conversely, materials which are crosslinked (eg, Pelvicol) are functionally nonporous. As a result, host cellular infiltration does not occur and the material is surrounded by a connective tissue envelop (ie, encapsulation, similar to synthetic type II materials) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p>If crosslinked materials are perforated prior to implantation (eg, Pelvisoft and Fortagen), they undergo a mixed response with incorporation at the perforations and encapsulation in the remainder of the material (similar to what is observed for type III synthetic materials) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p>Although crosslinking is performed to permanently stabilize the material, crosslinked graft resorption over time is an area of concern. According to the manufacturer report only, the process of resorption would be different for crosslinked and non crosslinked grafts.</p><p>It is not known whether eventual graft loss affects the structural integrity of the repair. Furthermore, it also remains to be elucidated if resorption occurs in all patients implanted with a crosslinked graft, or only in a subset of patients that reject the graft. This is illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small histopathologic study evaluated women who had undergone placement of a midurethral sling using a crosslinked porcine dermal collagen implant (Pelvicol) and who required sling revision due to recurrent stress urinary incontinence or urinary retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Time from graft placement to biopsy ranged from 15 to 67 months. Although the graft remained encapsulated in the early biopsy specimens, there was a progressive increase in the immunologic response at the graft-host interface at 21 weeks. Histiocyte and multinucleated giant cell infiltration of the graft was detected by 42 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. No residual graft was found in the 58- and 67-week samples, suggesting that the materials were resorbed in the interim [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/5,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, women who had a Pelvicol reinforced posterior repair were evaluated upon reoperation one year postoperatively; no residual Pelvicol was found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4104667507\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2069679391\"><span class=\"h2\">Encapsulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of materials that become encapsulated are avoided for midurethral sling procedures and vaginal prolapse repairs. Four different kits introduced since the mid-1990s, used for urinary incontinence (ProteGen, ObTape, and UraTape) and for vaginal prolapse repair (IVS Tunneler) have elicited an encapsulation response (eg, a type 2 or type 3 mesh). They were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration but were removed from the market within two to three years of introduction due to an unacceptably high rate of complications (sinus tract formation, urethral and bladder fistula, chronic discharge, elevated rates of exposure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reconstructive-materials-used-in-surgery-classification-and-host-response/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

The interposition of many reconstructive materials remains investigational. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are four categories of reconstructive surgical materials: synthetic material, autografts, allografts, and xenografts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72868\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72868 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Types of reconstructive materials'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Host response to a class of material depends upon the physical and structural properties of the prosthesis.

The type of response predisposes to increased risk of infection and mesh exposure. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Host response'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allograft processing is intended to render a prosthesis nonimmunogenic. Processing techniques vary by manufacturer and information is not publicly disclosed, thus limiting evidence-based comparison of allografts. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Allograft processing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemical crosslinking is a key determinant of host response to xenografts. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Xenograft processing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications associated with reconstructive materials include encapsulation, migration, erosion, and infection.
