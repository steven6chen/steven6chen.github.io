From a technical standpoint, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) of the tricuspid valve is slightly more challenging than it is for left-sided valves. The location of the tricuspid valve as the most rightward valve places it at or just beneath the sternal edge and requires the ultrasound beam to be angled sharply rightward while maintaining transducer contact with the chest wall. Image quality from the apical and subcostal windows is limited by far field beam attenuation and dispersion.</p><p>Despite these impediments, the tricuspid valve can be adequately evaluated in most TTE examinations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY OF THE NORMAL TRICUSPID VALVE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anatomically, the tricuspid valve consists of anterior, septal, and posterior leaflets. The anterior leaflet is the most anatomically constant echocardiographic feature, with the septal and posterior leaflets being variable in size and position.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Transthoracic echocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On two-dimensional (2-D) transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), the tricuspid valve is routinely recorded from the long (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56587\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56587 \">image 1</a>) and short axis parasternal, apical four-chamber, and subcostal views. Overall, all tricuspid valve leaflets can be seen in less than 60 percent of patients with 2-D TTE from the subcostal window [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The normal tricuspid leaflet thickness is &lt;3 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Identification of individual tricuspid valve leaflets in the 2-D views has been controversial. Data from pathologic examination, rotational 2-D tomograms, and 2-D reconstructions from three-dimensional (3-D) images have facilitated correct leaflet identification in 2-D views [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/1,3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the 2-D parasternal long axis (right ventricular inflow) view, the anterior leaflet is consistently visualized as the more proximal leaflet arising from the anterior free wall.

In up to 25 percent of individuals, the posterior leaflet is seen instead of the septal leaflet. Rotation to bring the interventricular septum into view will preferentially show the septal leaflet instead of the posterior leaflet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the parasternal short axis view at the level of the aortic valve, the posterior leaflet is imaged along the right ventricular free wall and either the septal or anterior leaflet is imaged adjacent to the aortic root [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]. Anterior angulation will generally bring the anterior leaflet into better view, and marked anterior angulation will show the anterior leaflet alone spanning the tricuspid annulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the apical four-chamber view, the septal leaflet is consistently visualized adjacent to the septum, and usually the anterior leaflet is visualized along the free wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/2,5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,7</a>], although occasionally the posterior leaflet is seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The subcostal view usually displays the anterior and septal leaflets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p>3-D imaging of the tricuspid valve enables en face visualization of the three leaflets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/1,5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,10</a>] in addition to facilitating leaflet identification in 2-D views [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The tricuspid valve annulus is slightly apically displaced compared with the mitral valve annulus; the gap resulting from this displacement is occupied by the membranous septum that separates the left ventricle from the right atrium. Attention to this feature is useful in identifying the tricuspid valve in many congenital conditions (such as Ebstein's anomaly) and in understanding the anatomic substrate for congenital or acquired left ventricular to right atrial shunts (via a Gerbode defect).

The higher frequency waves used in TEE do not penetrate deeply into the far field.</p><p>The tricuspid valve is best visualized in multiple TEE planes: the mid-esophageal four-chamber view at 0&ordm;, rotation at the mid-esophageal level to 30&ordm;, 60&ordm;, and 90&ordm; and from the transgastric view.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the four-chamber view, the septal and anterior leaflets are usually seen, and retroflexing the probe can bring the posterior leaflet into view.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity is best measured in a view in which the ultrasound beam and the regurgitant jet are most parallel, often between 30&ordm; and 90&ordm; in the mid-esophageal view.</p><p/><p>Measurement of tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity to estimate pressure gradients is discussed below.

Rheumatic tricuspid stenosis is usually associated with mitral valve stenosis as well as tricuspid regurgitation. Other, less common causes of tricuspid stenosis include congenital tricuspid atresia, tricuspid valve tumors, endomyocardial fibrosis and carcinoid heart disease, which typically manifests predominantly with tricuspid regurgitation. Rare causes, such as pacemaker-related endocarditis, have also been reported. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tricuspid-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tricuspid stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Two-dimensional echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two-dimensional (2-D) transthoracic echocardiography or transesophageal echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] enables identification of the specific features of tricuspid stenosis. Similar to mitral stenosis, the hallmark for the diagnosis is doming of the tricuspid valve seen in the parasternal long-axis view or in the apical four-chamber view. Other 2-D echocardiographic findings include thickened, distorted, and calcified leaflets and restrictive leaflet motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Doppler echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with the 2014 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology Valvular Heart Disease guidelines, which classify a tricuspid valve with mean pressure half-time &ge;190 ms or a valve area &le;1.0 cm<sup>2</sup> as being severely stenotic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The tricuspid gradient is highly variable depending upon heart rate, stroke volume, and phase of the respiratory cycle, though severe tricuspid stenosis is usually associated with a mean pressure gradient of at least 5 to 10 mmHg at a heart rate of 70 bpm.</p><p>Recordings for tricuspid stenosis are similar to those seen for mitral stenosis: There is turbulent diastolic inflow, higher-than-normal maximal flow during diastole, and an increased pressure half-time. The mean tricuspid diastolic gradient can be estimated from the tricuspid inflow time velocity integral by applying the modified Bernoulli equation. </p><p>Estimating tricuspid valve area using echocardiography is not as well-established as estimating mitral valve area. Methods for calculating mitral valve area, such as pressure half-time, the continuity equation, and proximal isovelocity surface area, can be applied to the tricuspid valve. Tricuspid valve area in cm<sup>2</sup> may be estimated as 190 divided by the pressure half-time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TRICUSPID REGURGITATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doppler studies have determined that about 70 percent of normal individuals have evidence of trace or functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) and more than 90 percent with established heart disease have evidence of TR. In the normal individual, the finding of trivial or mild (1+) TR is rarely of clinical importance beyond providing a means of obtaining an accurate determination of pulmonary artery systolic pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-assessment-of-the-right-heart#H9033356\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic assessment of the right heart&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary artery pressure'</a>.)</p><p>Echocardiography provides a means to estimate the severity of TR, measure the velocity of TR (to estimate the systolic right ventricular [RV] to right atrial gradient), and identify the mechanism responsible for TR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/12,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15,16</a>]. When reporting the right ventricular systolic pressure from measurement of the peak TR velocity, it is important to avoid underestimates from incomplete Doppler waveforms or overestimates from artifact extending beyond the true Doppler waveform. It is best to measure along the modal frequency of complete Doppler envelopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. If possible, sample the TR jet from several views and, if they differ, choose the highest velocity. The four-chamber view is usually, but not always, the highest velocity. If only one view provides a complete TR jet, the velocity may be underestimated. As explained below, the magnitude of the TR gradient does not necessarily correlate with TR severity. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Peak velocity of the jet'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1320624895\"><span class=\"h2\">Summary of tricuspid regurgitation classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As recommended in the 2014 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACC)</span> valve guidelines, TR is classified using a staging system based upon symptoms and severity of valvular heart disease, including valve anatomy, valve hemodynamics (largely from Doppler examination), and hemodynamic consequences reflected in the right ventricle, right atrium, and inferior vena cava (IVC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F96926\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96926 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Severe TR is identified using the following valve hemodynamic parameters: central jet area &gt;10 cm<sup>2</sup>, vena contracta width &gt;7 mm, dense triangular Doppler continuous wave jet contour with early peak, and hepatic vein systolic flow reversal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F96926\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96926 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Evidence of the hemodynamic effects of TR include dilated right ventricle, right atrium and IVC with decreased IVC respirophasic variation, elevated right atrial pressure with c-V wave, and diastolic flattening of the interventricular septum.</p><p>We agree with the following key points from the European Association of Echocardiography (EAE) and the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging recommendations on assessment of valvular regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The color flow area of the regurgitant jet is not recommended to quantify the severity of TR. The color flow imaging should only be used for diagnosing TR. However, the document notes that a large eccentric jet reaching the posterior wall of the right atrium suggests significant TR and that a small central jet usually indicates mild TR. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When feasible, the measurement of the vena contracta (VC) is recommended to quantify TR.

In one small series, the specificity of systolic hepatic flow reversal was 93 percent and the sensitivity was 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Systolic hepatic flow reversal represents the strongest nonvalvular parameter for evaluating TR severity. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When TR is more than mild, evaluation of RV dimensions and function, right atrial volume, IVC diameter, and the pulmonary arterial systolic pressure is mandatory. Assessment of RV systolic function using tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and systolic myocardial velocity (at the lateral tricuspid annulus) is reasonable when searching for RV dysfunction. However, TAPSE and systolic myocardial velocities are load dependent and may not reflect true RV myocardial function in patients with severe TR.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-assessment-of-the-right-heart#H9033293\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic assessment of the right heart&quot;, section on 'Right ventricular size'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Right ventricular function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is useful to examine the descent of the RV base toward the apex as a guide to RV systolic function. The excursion of RV base frequently becomes accentuated in acute TR and also with long-standing significant TR with <span class=\"nowrap\">normal/compensated</span> RV function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. However, the RV may later fail with depressed RV basal motion in the setting of severe TR and chronic volume overload. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-assessment-of-the-right-heart#H9033300\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic assessment of the right heart&quot;, section on 'Right ventricular function'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Interventricular septum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When severe TR is present, RV volume overload causes diastolic interventricular septal flattening. The left ventricle becomes D-shaped, as increased preload in the RV displaces the septum toward the left. Septal flattening is best appreciated in the short-axis view at the level of the basal or mid-left ventricle. However, this sign of RV volume overload is not specific for severe TR. If severe TR coexists with pulmonary hypertension, combined RV pressure and volume overload results in septal flattening occurring in both systole and diastole. Since diastolic interventricular septal flattening represents relative RV and left ventricular filling, an RV overload pattern may be manifest in the setting of mitral stenosis and less severe forms of TR.

With isolated TR, the right atrium appears enlarged and spherical when compared to the left atrium. The degree of right atrial enlargement depends upon many factors, including the duration and severity of TR, intrinsic disease of atrial muscle, and, if present, the duration of chronic atrial fibrillation. A normal-sized right atrium coexisting with severe TR suggests that the valve lesion is of recent onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

In the presence of significant TR, the volume changes in the right atrium during the cardiac cycle are exaggerated and more visually obvious. If the RV systolic function is normal, the descent of the RV base (TAPSE) will also have exaggerated motion, both in absolute displacement and relative to motion of the left ventricular base.

Leaflet coaptation may be apically displaced, a finding that has been advocated as a method for recognizing impaired coaptation and identifying significant TR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

By color flow imaging, this phenomenon may be visualized as a series of concentric, roughly hemispheric isovelocity shells of decreasing surface area and increasing surface velocity. The relatively low sampling rate of color flow imaging limits the peak measurable blood velocity. When flow velocity exceeds the aliasing velocity (Nyquist limit), color reversal occurs.

The cause of functional TR appears to be tricuspid annular dilatation (due to right ventricular [RV] or right atrial enlargement) and tethering of the tricuspid valve leaflets, although the mechanisms of valve dysfunction have not been fully defined. Causes of functional TR include disease states that can cause RV dilatation and failure, such as left heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, left-to-right shunt, and RV infarction.

Effective treatment of left ventricular failure often results in a decrease or disappearance of TR, thereby confirming the diagnosis of functional TR.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1320624198\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary tricuspid regurgitation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h3\">Rheumatic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rheumatic disease, where prevalent, is a common cause of TR. In patients with rheumatic heart disease, significant TR almost never exists as an isolated lesion and generally accompanies rheumatic mitral involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The degree of anatomic change affecting the tricuspid valve is almost always less than that affecting the mitral valve. Among patients with rheumatic mitral disease, TR occurs with normal as well as deformed leaflets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Rheumatic features including diffuse leaflet thickening, restriction of opening motion by commissural fusion, calcification of the leaflets, and chordal shortening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Restriction of leaflet mobility produces characteristic leaflets motion with failure to move apart and &quot;doming&quot; as a unit into the right ventricle during diastole.</p><p>Rheumatic TR is frequently accompanied by tricuspid stenosis. Because the tricuspid valve annulus is large, tricuspid stenosis without regurgitation is considerably less common. In a study of 788 consecutive patients aged 9 to 64 with rheumatic heart disease in India, 9 percent had echocardiographic evidence of tricuspid valve involvement and all had mitral valve stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Of these patients, 50 percent had TR, 7 percent had tricuspid stenosis, and 43 percent had combined TR and stenosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h3\">Tricuspid valve prolapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myxomatous disease of the mitral valve is often accompanied by tricuspid involvement but isolated tricuspid prolapse has rarely been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Among patients with mitral valve prolapse, the likelihood that the tricuspid valve will develop this form of degeneration increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonarrhythmic complications of mitral valve prolapse&quot;, section on 'Prolapse of other valves'</a>.)</p><p>Prolapse is identified as superior systolic displacement of leaflets above the tricuspid valve annulus into the right atrium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53562\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53562 \">image 7</a>), which may be best assessed in a parasternal short axis view. Additional echocardiographic features that may be present include varying degrees of diffuse leaflet thickening (ground glass, not calcific) and leaflet elongation. As with mitral valve prolapse, milder degrees of tricuspid valve prolapse show late systolic displacement and late systolic TR. Late systolic TR may cause a large jet area and a large regurgitant orifice area with only mild to moderate regurgitation since the regurgitant volume is determined by the orifice area and the magnitude and <strong>duration</strong> of the regurgitation.</p><p>Since the tricuspid valve annulus is nonplanar, the choice of imaging plane may impact the accuracy of diagnosis of prolapse. Analysis of tricuspid annular geometry by three-dimensional echocardiography indicates that the tricuspid valve has a bimodal or saddle shape with an anterior high point between the anterior and septal leaflets and a posterior high point adjacent to the posterior leaflet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>In the two-dimensional (2-D) four-chamber view, the mediolateral imaging plane cuts the tricuspid annulus along its inferior points. As a result, the leaflets may appear to prolapse superior to the annular rim in this view while they remain below the annular rim in the anteroposterior plane. These data suggest that the presence or absence of tricuspid valve prolapse is ideally evaluated in views aligned with the anteroposterior axis, such as the parasternal short axis view at the level of the aorta.</p><p>Clinically important degrees of TR are uncommon in myxomatous disease but can occur, especially if there is spontaneous or iatrogenic chordal rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-tricuspid-valve/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

TTE is often nondiagnostic in this setting.
