While neither chemotherapy nor autologous HCT produces a cure, event-free survival and overall survival are prolonged following autologous HCT when compared with treatment with conventional chemotherapy alone.</p><p>As new chemotherapeutic agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>) are incorporated into the initial treatment of MM, survival with chemotherapy alone is improving. Whether the use of these newer agents, alone or in combination, will delay or eliminate the need for HCT in patients with MM is not known at this time. In addition, survival with HCT is improving for certain populations with the incorporation of double (tandem) autologous HCT.</p><p>In contrast, allogeneic HCT has the potential for cure, although at a cost of increased treatment-related mortality. The use of allogeneic HCT for MM is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Practical issues regarding the use of autologous HCT in myeloma are presented here. Eligibility criteria for HCT, a comparison of HCT with other treatment strategies, and the initial chemotherapy choices for patients with myeloma are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of multiple myeloma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-initial-chemotherapy-for-symptomatic-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of initial chemotherapy for symptomatic multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The term &quot;hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot; (HCT) will be used throughout this review as a general term to cover transplantation of progenitor (stem) cells from any source (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, cord blood). Otherwise, the source of such cells will be specified (eg, autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL CHEMOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients who are candidates for HCT, induction chemotherapy is administered for approximately four months prior to stem cell collection in order to reduce the number of tumor cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, lessen symptoms, and mitigate end-organ damage. Specifically, melphalan-containing regimens should be avoided prior to the collection of stem cells, since their use has been associated with damage to the hematopoietic stem cell compartment as well as an increased risk of myelodysplasia following transplantation.</p><p>Drugs that are not known to damage the hematopoietic stem cells (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>) are preferred for initial therapy. Initial data suggest that these agents do not have an impact on the quality of stem cells collected, but may have variable impact on the ability to collect adequate hematopoietic stem cells. Specifically, prolonged initial therapy with a lenalidomide-based regimen may impair hematopoietic stem cell collection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This effect appears to be minimized if hematopoietic stem cells are collected within the first four cycles of initial therapy and by using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=plerixafor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">plerixafor</a> in patients who have problems mobilizing adequate stem cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Retrospective studies and post-hoc analyses of prospective studies have evaluated the effect of response to induction therapy as a predictor of outcome following HCT with mixed results.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A post-hoc analysis of the IFM 2005-01 trial of induction chemotherapy followed by HCT evaluated the effect of response to induction therapy on the outcomes of 482 patients with previously untreated symptomatic MM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, adriamycin, and dexamethasone (VAD). Patients who achieved less than a very good partial response (VGPR) after the first HCT could receive a second HCT. Patients who achieved a VGPR after induction chemotherapy had a significantly longer median progression-free survival when compared with patients who achieved a VGPR only after high dose therapy and HCT (41 versus 31 months, respectively). However, in this trial, the arm with the higher VGPR rate (bortezomib dexamethasone) with induction did not have better overall survival. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single institution retrospective analysis included 472 patients with newly diagnosed MM who underwent HCT within 12 months of their initial diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Among patients who received initial chemotherapy with VAD, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> alone, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a> plus dexamethasone, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a> plus dexamethasone, there was no significant difference in response rates after HCT, post-transplantation complications, or treatment-related mortality. Longer follow-up is needed to evaluate median time to progression and overall survival after HCT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single institution retrospective analysis of 286 patients who underwent HCT after induction therapy containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a> reported that, when compared with patients who achieved a partial remission (PR) with induction therapy, patients who failed to achieve a PR had a significantly shorter median overall survival (30.4 versus 73.5 months) and progression-free survival (13.1 versus 22.1 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p>The above studies should be interpreted cautiously. They do not demonstrate that the type of initial therapy does not matter in terms of overall benefit since they only included patients who made it to transplant, and excluded patients who, due to differences in morbidity and mortality with each regimen, died during induction or failed to qualify for transplant as a result of induction-related morbidity. For example, the induction-related early mortality prior to transplant is approximately 10 percent in many studies evaluating <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> alone or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a> plus dexamethasone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>], but less than 1 percent with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a> plus low-dose dexamethasone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus the choice of initial therapy is important and does affect overall outcome.</p><p>In addition, these studies do not provide guidance regarding the optimal management of a patient who fails to achieve a PR with induction therapy. Such patients do benefit from HCT, although potential options that require evaluation in prospective trials include: modification or intensification of induction therapy or preparative regimen for the transplant (see below), tandem transplantation, and maintenance therapy after HCT.</p><p>The specific regimen used as initial therapy is determined based upon patient characteristics, induction-related early mortality and morbidity, ease of administration, and side effect profiles. The choice of initial chemotherapy is discussed in detail separately.

Hematopoietic stem cells can be harvested directly from the bone marrow or collected by apheresis from the peripheral blood after stimulation with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) are preferable to bone marrow cells for transplantation due to quicker engraftment and a potential for less contamination of the infused cells with tumor cells. The various sources of hematopoietic stem cells are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic support after hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Autologous PBPC transplantation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells#H10150103\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;, section on 'PBPC mobilization'</a>.)</p><p>G-CSF alone and G-CSF plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> are the most common regimens used for stem cell mobilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. The usual dose of G-CSF is 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per day subcutaneous. Cyclophosphamide is usually administered at a dose of 1.5 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/m<sup>2</sup></span> intravenous for two days. The choice between the two methods is mainly dependent on institutional preference and experience. There are no randomized trials comparing the two approaches.</p><p>At Mayo Clinic, we prefer G-CSF alone (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> once daily), and reserve G-CSF plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> for patients who fail to collect adequate stem cells with G-CSF alone, and for patients who have had an inadequate response to induction therapy. This is supported by the observation that patients with a high tumor burden demonstrate delayed platelet recovery when transfused with PBPCs collected following growth factor treatment alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Some institutions use G-CSF plus cyclophosphamide as their standard. G-CSF plus cyclophosphamide has the advantage of providing much higher PBPCs than G-CSF alone, but also carries the risk of longer time to start collection and the risk of neutropenia.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=plerixafor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Plerixafor</a>, a chemokine receptor type 4 inhibitor that acts to impair the binding of hematopoietic stem cells within the bone marrow microenvironment, is also available for use in combination with G-CSF in patients with MM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].

We begin apheresis when the peripheral CD34+ counts reach 10 CD34 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Apheresis is performed with a goal of collecting at least 3 x 10<sup>6</sup> CD34+ <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg</span> if only one transplant is being considered, or at least 6 x 10<sup>6</sup> CD34+ <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg</span> if two transplants are being considered. A minimum of 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> CD34+ <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/kg</span> is considered essential for one transplant. In general, we harvest enough PBPCs for two transplantations; a single transplantation is done with one-half of the collected cells and the other half are cryopreserved. A second (tandem) transplant (using the cryopreserved stem cells) is considered for patients not achieving complete or near complete response with the first transplant. For patients achieving complete or near complete response with the first transplant, the cryopreserved stem cells may be reserved for transplantation at relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCESSING AND STORAGE OF STEM CELLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) are cryopreserved in 5 percent dimethylsulfoxide to be thawed at the bedside at the time of infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

As expected, early transplant was associated with higher rates of severe neutropenia, gastrointestinal toxicities, and infections.

Approximately 24 hours after completion of the preparative chemotherapy, peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) are reinfused. A period of pancytopenia follows. Red blood cell and platelet transfusions are administered as necessary while hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors (ie, G-CSF) are used to speed neutrophil engraftment. Neutrophil engraftment usually occurs by day 12 and platelet counts are expected to recover to greater than 20,000 by day 16 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

The preferred method is the measurement of monoclonal (M) protein in serum or urine. Free light chain (FLC) measurements are reserved for patients with unmeasurable levels of M protein in the serum and urine. Among patients without an M protein in serum or urine and normal FLC ratio, further evaluation includes bone marrow immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence and plasma cell labeling index. We typically assess patients on day 100 following HCT and, if doing well, we reassess every three to four months thereafter.</p><p>The International Myeloma Working Group has developed uniform response criteria, which are used to measure the effect of treatment for MM. These criteria are described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-response-to-treatment-of-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluating response to treatment of multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Investigators have also examined the use of multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) as a measurement of minimal residual disease (MRD) and predictor of outcome in patients after autologous HCT. As an example, a prospective analysis of 295 patients with newly diagnosed MM evaluated the use of MFC of bone marrow samples obtained at day 100 following autologous HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. At a median follow-up of 57 months, patients who had no evidence of MRD had significantly longer median progression-free (71 versus 37 months, respectively) and overall survival (not reached versus 89 months, respectively) when compared with patients who had MRD. However, at this time, the importance of monitoring for MRD and the impact of MRD on the timing of further treatment is unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20487598\"><span class=\"h2\">Significance of response to chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relationship between survival and the degree of response (complete versus partial) to initial therapy is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. While some studies have suggested a survival benefit from attaining a deeper response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/34,75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,75,76</a>], it is unknown whether this just reflects underlying disease biology (ie, a prognostic marker) or specific treatment effect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-multiple-myeloma#H55654210\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Significance of response to chemotherapy'</a>.) </p><p>A survival benefit from attaining a deeper response was demonstrated in a retrospective study of 445 patients with MM who underwent autologous HCT between 2002 and 2008 with a median follow-up of 77 months from HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

The heterogeneity of initial therapy and of salvage therapy available over the time period studied limit the extrapolation of these data to determine goal of therapy. One must be careful when interpreting studies that show improved outcome in responders versus nonresponders (eg, CR versus no CR) since such comparisons have inherent methodologic flaws that cannot be overcome by increasing the sample size. In general, whether a treatment works or not, &quot;responders&quot; will typically appear to do better than &quot;nonresponders&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>]. One way of overcoming the bias that exists when comparing responders with nonresponders is to perform landmark analysis at time points that ensure that almost all patients have had time to reach the response level being studied.</p><p>Another factor to consider when assessing the significance of response to chemotherapy or HCT is whether a maximum response has been attained at the time of assessment. While patients are conventionally tested at day 100 following HCT to determine disease response, monoclonal protein levels will continue to decline in a significant percentage of patients. As an example, in one study of 430 patients with MM who underwent autologous HCT within one year of their diagnosis and had not attained a complete remission at day 100, 167 patients (39 percent) showed a deepening of their response after day 100 without further treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF RELAPSE AFTER HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis of patients who relapse after autologous HCT appears to differ depending upon the timing of the relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>]. As an example, a retrospective analysis of 494 patients who had relapsed after HCT found that those who relapse within the first 12 months have a shorter median overall survival (approximately 20 versus 83 months from HCT) when compared with those who relapse after 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Treatment options for relapsed MM after an autologous HCT include a second autologous HCT, nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT as part of a clinical trial, or treatment with salvage chemotherapy.</p><p>In general, a second autologous HCT is not recommended for patients who relapse within 12 to 18 months (if no maintenance therapy was given) of the first, since the progression free survival following the second HCT will most likely be even shorter than the benefit seen with the first transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In patients who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a> maintenance, a second autologous HCT is not considered if the relapse occurs within 36 months of the first HCT. These patients are best treated with active agents that they have not received before or have had good responses to in the past as well as clinical trials investigating novel therapies.</p><p>As mentioned above, we routinely harvest enough stem cells at initial chemotherapy for two transplantations; a single transplantation is done with one-half of the collected cells and the other half is cryopreserved. A second (tandem) transplant (using the cryopreserved stem cells) is considered for patients not achieving complete or near complete response with the first transplant. For patients achieving complete or near complete response with the first transplant, we suggest reserving the cryopreserved stem cells are for a second autologous HCT to be used at the time of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

In this trial, patients with first progressive or relapsed disease at least 18 months after prior autologous HCT were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (PAD) followed by peripheral blood stem cell collection.

There was poor accrual and the trial was stopped early for benefit. After a median follow-up of 31 months, second autologous HCT resulted in a longer median time to progression (19 versus 11 months; hazard ratio 0.36). Further follow-up is necessary to assess overall survival.</p><p>Further experience comes from a single institution retrospective analysis of 200 patients with myeloma who received a second autologous HCT after recurrence following initial therapy that included an autologous HCT (37 percent tandem) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. A partial or greater response was seen in 80 percent by day 100. At a median follow-up of 57 months, the median progression-free and overall survival times following second autologous HCT were 15 and 42 months, respectively. Outcomes were worse among patients who had an initial remission duration &lt;18 months and those who had less than a partial response to reinduction therapy prior to HCT.</p><p>For patients who have already undergone a second HCT as part of a double (tandem) HCT or patients who were unable to collect enough progenitor (stem) cells for a second HCT, we discuss the possibility of allogeneic HCT or salvage chemotherapy.
