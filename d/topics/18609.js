About 5 percent of patients with VSDs have chromosomal abnormalities including trisomy 13, 18, and 21 syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. DNA sequence variants within the GATA6, TBX2, and TBX18 genes may also be involved in VSD genesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. VSDs are of various sizes and locations, can be single or multiple, and in adults may be complicated by subpulmonary stenosis, pulmonary hypertension, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aortic or tricuspid valve regurgitation, making their clinical presentation, natural history, and treatment variable and sometimes challenging. Although, VSDs are associated with other congenital heart defects including atrial septal defect (35 percent), patent ductus arteriosus (22 percent), right aortic arch (13 percent), pulmonic stenosis, and more complex defects such as transposition of the great arteries and tetralogy of Fallot, the majority of congenital VSDs in adults present as an isolated defect, which is the focus of this topic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Ventricular septal defects result from deficient growth or failure of fusion of these components and vary in size from tiny apertures to very large defects with virtual absence of the septum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In 2000, the Society for Thoracic Surgery and the European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery established a unified reporting system for congenital heart disease including ventricular septal defects (VSDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. They classified VSD into four types: type 1 defects involve the infundibular septum, type 2 defects involve the membranous septum, type 3 defects involve the inlet septum, and type 4 defects involve the muscular septum. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infundibular VSD (type 1, also referred to as supracristal, subarterial, subpulmonary, conal, or doubly committed juxta-arterial VSD) results from deficiency in the septum above and anterior to the crista supraventricularis, beneath the aortic and pulmonary valves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59434\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59434 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72186\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72186 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105728\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef105728 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54870\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef54870 \">movie 2</a>). The resultant loss of support of the right <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the left aortic valve cusp causes cusp prolapse into the VSD, leading to progressive aortic regurgitation and occasionally sinus dilatation, which is the hallmark of this defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Infundibular VSDs are more common in Asia where they account for one third of VSDs compared to a much lower frequency in the United States (6 percent of VSDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A membranous VSD (type 2, also known as conoventricular) results from deficiency of the membranous septum and is the most common type of VSD (80 percent of VSDs in the United States) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59434\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59434 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75794\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75794 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105727\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef105727 \">movie 3</a>). This defect is inferior to the crista supraventricularis and borders the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve. The defect may extend into the muscular septum and is then referred to as a perimembranous (or paramembranous) VSD. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inlet defects (type 3, also known as atrioventricular canal type) result from deficiency of the inlet septum located beneath both mitral and tricuspid valves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79923\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79923 \">image 3</a>). Despite proximity to those valves, this type of defect is not associated with mitral or tricuspid regurgitation unless associated with atrioventricular canal defect; these defects are typically large and often associated with Down syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-atrial-septal-defects-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of atrial septal defects in adults&quot;, section on 'Primum ASD'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Heart disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscular defects (type 4), which account for 5 to 20 percent of VSDs, are bordered only by muscle within the trabecular septum, away from the cardiac valves. Muscular defects can be small or large, single or multiple, and occasionally oblique with multiple exits resembling Swiss cheese.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The least common VSD is the atrioventricular VSD or Gerbode defect caused by deficiency of the membranous septum separating the left ventricle from the right atrium causing a left ventricular to right atrial shunt. This defect has also been reported as an acquired lesion following endocarditis and valve replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26371611\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The direction and severity of the shunt associated with ventricular septal defect (VSD) are determined by its functional size and, in the absence of right ventricular outflow obstruction, by the ratio of pulmonary to systemic vascular resistance. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small or restrictive VSDs are defined as those with an orifice dimension less than or equal to 25 percent of the aortic annulus diameter. Small VSDs cause small left to right shunts with no left ventricular volume overload or pulmonary hypertension (PH). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate sized defects, measuring more than 25 but less than 75 percent of the aortic annulus diameter, cause moderate sized shunts and result in mild to moderate volume overload of the pulmonary arteries, left atrium, and left ventricle and no or mild PH. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large VSDs, defined as those with diameters equal to or greater than 75 percent of that of the aortic annulus, generally cause moderate to large left to right shunts with left ventricular volume overload and, if they remain uncorrected, cause severe PH due to longstanding unobstructed pulmonary flow with resultant pulmonary arterial obstructive disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With progressive pulmonary arterial hypertension, the right ventricular pressure can reach systemic levels leading to reversal of the shunt so that it is directed right to left with resultant hypoxemia and cyanosis; this is known as Eisenmenger syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Eisenmenger syndrome in association with VSD is often referred to as Eisenmenger complex. Elevated right ventricular and right atrial pressures cause right ventricle hypertrophy and right atrial enlargement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-prognosis-of-eisenmenger-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and prognosis of Eisenmenger syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2037644488\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Right atrial enlargement is associated with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) in three settings: (1) Eisenmenger complex, (2) a Gerbode defect, and (3) in the presence of double chambered right ventricle (DCRV). </p><p>Double-chambered right ventricle (DCRV) is a form of acquired subpulmonic stenosis. DCRV is caused by hypertrophy of an aberrant muscle bundle that develops in the right ventricle in the region of the membranous VSD jet flow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58886\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58886 \">image 4</a>). As its name implies, in DCRV, the RV is divided into two chambers: a proximal high-pressure chamber close to the tricuspid valve and a distal low pressure chamber underneath the pulmonary valve separated by the obstructive muscle bundle. This condition occurs in 3 to 10 percent of patients with membranous VSDs and protects against the development of PH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Aortic regurgitation occurs in association with infundibular VSD and less commonly with membranous VSD. It results from deficiency or hypoplasia of the conal septum causing an anatomically unsupported aortic valve cusp and aortic sinus. During systole, a Venturi effect drives the right or left aortic valve cusp into the RV through the VSD, thus making the VSD smaller (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77305\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77305 \">figure 3</a>). During diastole, the intraaortic pressure forces the other aortic valve cusps to close, but the unsupported cusp is pushed down into the left ventricular outflow tract away from the other aortic valve cusps, resulting in prolapse, progressive aortic regurgitation, and progressive left ventricular volume overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]; this appears to be less common in adult patients with infundibular VSD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Aortic sinus dilation may occur in a patient with a VSD, most commonly with infundibular VSD. Rarely, rupture of the aneurysmal sinus of Valsalva occurs in this setting and causes a continuous murmur and large left-to-right shunt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The change in a murmur to a continuous murmur and new symptoms occurring in a patient with a known VSD are the clinical clues that lead to this diagnosis. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26371619\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5506780\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isolated ventricular septal defect (VSD) generally presents with one of the following clinical scenarios:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with an isolated small restrictive VSD with small left to right shunt (often referred to as &ldquo;maladie de Roger&rdquo;) generally remain asymptomatic into adulthood, but aortic regurgitation may develop and there is a low risk of endocarditis. (See <a href=\"#H26371692\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with moderate sized VSDs may remain asymptomatic or develop symptoms of mild heart failure in childhood. Heart failure usually resolves with medical therapy and with time as the child grows and the VSD gets smaller in absolute <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> relative terms. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following scenarios may occur with large VSDs: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most patients with large VSDs have early large left to right shunting with development of heart failure during infancy. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In rare cases, the pulmonary vascular resistance does not fall normally post-natally, left to right shunting is less marked, and presentation with Eisenmenger syndrome occurs sometime during late childhood to early adulthood. The right to left shunt causes cyanosis. </p><p/><p>Dyspnea and fatigue in patients with VSDs result from either progressive left ventricular overload due to the VSD or from significant aortic regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension (PH) or double chambered right ventricle (DCRV). Syncope is a rare symptom in patients with VSD; it may be caused by severe PH, right ventricular outflow obstruction (such as DCRV), or large aneurysm of the membranous septum. Patients with VSDs may also rarely present with arrhythmias or sudden death. </p><p>Patients may also present with a change in the murmur on physical examination caused by the development of DCRV, PH, ruptured sinus of Valsalva, or aortic regurgitation. Membranous VSD may close spontaneously via adherence of the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve, which forms an aneurysm of the membranous septum; this septal aneurysm may cause a new midsystolic click and may lead to syncope due to RV outflow obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26371633\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most VSDs can be readily identified by cardiac examination depending on their type, size, and associated hemodynamic abnormalities. The smaller the VSD, the louder is the associated murmur. Small VSDs cause a loud high-frequency systolic murmur, often accompanied by a palpable thrill in the third or fourth left intercostal space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The aortic closure sound may be normal or masked by the loud murmur. Although, the VSD murmur is typically a holosystolic plateau-shaped murmur, it may stop well before the second sound with some muscular defects because of midsystolic obliteration of the defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;, section on 'Ventricular septal defect'</a>.) </p><p>The typical holosystolic VSD murmur may be replaced by a &ldquo;diamond-shaped&rdquo; (crescendodecrescendo) midsystolic murmur or simply consist of a systolic ejection component in the presence of pulmonic stenosis. Similarly, DCRV with VSD is associated with a loud midsystolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur at the left sternal border, often associated with a thrill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. An infundibular VSD allows blood to be shunted toward the pulmonary artery and therefore there may be a systolic ejection murmur heard maximally in the second intercostal space. As shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56343\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56343 \">figure 4</a>), the cardiac examination of patients with VSD and valvular or subvalvular pulmonary stenosis depends on the severity of the latter lesion. </p><p>Patients with infundibular or membranous VSDs who develop aortic regurgitation demonstrate a diastolic decrescendo murmur. When the aortic regurgitation is severe, wide pulse pressure, pistol shot femoral, and collapsing pulses are often noted. A to-and-fro, <span class=\"nowrap\">systolic/diastolic</span> murmur, best heard in the upper sternal border, composed of a systolic VSD murmur and a separate high-frequency diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation is also noted. This may simulate continuous murmurs such as those heard with ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm or patent ductus arteriosus. However, in patients with VSD and aortic regurgitation, the systolic component stops at or before the second heart sound and does not envelop it as continuous murmurs do. The presence of long-standing severe aortic regurgitation will also cause left ventricular enlargement. </p><p>When VSD is complicated by pulmonary vascular obstructive disease and severe PH as in Eisenmenger complex, the patients have central cyanosis, and clubbed digits. The typical findings on cardiac examination in Eisenmenger complex include the following (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-prognosis-of-eisenmenger-syndrome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and prognosis of Eisenmenger syndrome&quot;, section on 'General features'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of the typical holosystolic murmur of VSD due to equalization of right ventricular and left ventricular pressures with associated loss of the left-to-right shunt.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jugular venous pressure examination demonstrating a prominent &quot;a&quot; wave due to right ventricular hypertrophy.

However, various electrocardiographic abnormalities such as intraventricular conduction delay or right bundle branch block have been observed among those with larger defects. In addition, electrocardiographic signs of left atrial enlargement and left ventricular enlargement or hypertrophy can be present with significant left ventricular volume overload due to VSD shunt <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aortic regurgitation. </p><p>In the presence of Eisenmenger complex, or significant right ventricular outflow obstruction such as caused by double chambered right ventricle (DCRV), the electrocardiogram reflects the elevated RV pressure with findings including right axis deviation, features of right atrial enlargement, and RV or biventricular hypertrophy. The prevalence of atrial and ventricular premature beats and arrhythmias increases as the RV pressure increases and therefore may be incidentally noted on the electrocardiogram. &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26371655\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest radiograph</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chest radiograph in patients with uncomplicated small VSD demonstrates a normal cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vascular markings. With larger VSDs, the chest radiograph may show cardiomegaly with prominent left ventricular contour and left atrial and pulmonary artery enlargement due to volume overload; this is directly related to the magnitude of the shunt. The chest radiograph may also show evidence of shunt vascularity. Cardiomegaly on chest radiograph suggests a significant left to right shunt through the VSD with a pulmonary to systemic flow ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">(Qp/Qs)</span> &gt;2 or the presence of significant aortic regurgitation, or both. </p><p>In the presence of Eisenmenger complex, the cardiomegaly noted on chest radiograph has an RV contour due to RV hypertrophy and is frequently accompanied by right atrial enlargement and prominent central pulmonary arteries with pruning of peripheral pulmonary vessels. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26371662\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) examination is the single most important clinical test needed in evaluating the patient with a VSD, its hemodynamic burden, associated congenital defects, and potential long-term complications. TTE has an excellent detection rate (88 to 95 percent) for VSD depending on the size and location, and the technical expertise of the examiner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. TTE is most sensitive for VSDs larger than 5 mm and those located in the membranous, inlet, or infundibular septum, while being least sensitive for those in the apical trabecular septum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-evaluation-of-ventricular-septal-defects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic evaluation of ventricular septal defects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A thorough TTE examination is best achieved by imaging the ventricular septum and surrounding structures in multiple planes with color flow and spectral Doppler. The parasternal long axis views allow the distinct visualization of muscular, membranous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75794\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75794 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105727\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef105727 \">movie 3</a>), and infundibular defects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105728\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef105728 \">movie 1</a>). The latter two defects are both seen below the aortic valve and are sometimes difficult to differentiate from each other on the long-axis echo image. On parasternal short axis imaging, these VSD types are clearly distinguished with a membranous defect adjacent to the tricuspid valve, whereas an infundibular defect is adjacent to the pulmonary valve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59434\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59434 \">figure 2</a>). The parasternal view also enables visualization of an aneurysm of the membranous septum or sinus of Valsalva and assists in the evaluation of aortic regurgitation severity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72186\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72186 \">image 1</a>) and DCRV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58886\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58886 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F105729\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef105729 \">movie 4</a>). </p><p>The apical views enable assessment of inlet muscular and Gerbode defects. Inlet defects are adjacent to the mitral and tricuspid valves as seen in (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79923\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79923 \">image 3</a>) and extend into the chordal attachments of the tricuspid valve, whereas the muscular defects are located in the trabecular septum away from the cardiac valves. Gerbode defects are best visualized within the cardiac crux on apical four-chamber view in which color flow Doppler demonstrates a left ventricular to right atrial shunt.</p><p>In addition to the accurate identification of the morphologic features of the VSD, its size, and borders, echocardiography also provides a hemodynamic assessment of the shunt severity; identifies volume overload of the left atrium, left ventricle, and pulmonary artery; and identifies the presence and severity of associated complications including DCRV, aortic regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension (PH), and aneurysm of membranous septum or sinus of Valsalva aneurysm. The pulmonary to systemic flow ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">(Qp/Qs)</span> is generally not calculated by echocardiography due to technical limitations. The presence of normal left atrial and left ventricular size is suggestive of a small restrictive uncomplicated VSD with small left to right shunt. On the other hand, enlargement of the left atrium, left ventricle, and pulmonary artery is indicative of a larger VSD with significant left to right shunt necessitating consideration of repair.

In the presence of significant systemic hypertension, the threshold velocity for a restrictive VSD is higher. With a tunnel-type VSD (suggested by defect <span class=\"nowrap\">length/width</span> &gt;1.2), continuous wave Doppler may overestimate the interventricular pressure gradient due to pressure recovery phenomena [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On the other hand, low continuous wave Doppler velocities across the VSD suggest elevated RV pressure that may be related to the presence of valvular pulmonary stenosis, DCRV, or PH. When the RV pressure is elevated, the pressure difference between the left and right ventricle is reduced. </p><p/><p>When assessing the hemodynamic burden of a VSD and any associated lesions, it is imperative to obtain an accurate estimation of the RV and pulmonary artery pressures. All echocardiographic windows should be used to acquire a clear distinct noncontaminated tricuspid regurgitant velocity signal to enable accurate estimation of the RV and pulmonary artery systolic pressures. Occasionally, this cannot be accurately measured due to location or direction of the VSD jet; the pulmonary regurgitation jet may help define the pulmonary artery pressure. Occasionally, cardiac catheterization will be required to assess the pulmonary pressures and shunt flow. Finally, echocardiography provides an excellent noninvasive assessment of the degree of aortic valve distortion, prolapse, and aortic regurgitation in most patients with infundibular or membranous VSDs.</p><p>Echocardiographic assessment of VSD can usually be performed accurately using two-dimensional (2D) TTE. Advances in three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography have made it possible to visualize VSDs accurately using 3D full-volume with cropping or narrow-sector live 3D imaging protocols, irrespective of their location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. 3D echocardiography may also be used in the evaluation of ventricular volumes. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is reserved for patients with suboptimal precordial windows and when specific questions are not confidently answered using TTE such as the degree of aortic valve distortion, severity of aortic regurgitation, and the presence of vegetations when endocarditis is suspected. TEE or intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) are also used during interventional procedures. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26371670\"><span class=\"h2\">Stress testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adult patients with congenital heart disease exhibit a great ability to adapt to the functional limitations imposed by their birth defect. Concern has been raised that this adaptability may result in lack of reported symptoms, which in turn may delay intervention since the presence of symptoms is a common indication for repair. </p><p>As a result, we advocate the use of exercise stress testing to objectively assess the exercise tolerance and functional aerobic capacity. The inability to achieve 70 percent of expected functional aerobic capacity is felt to be abnormal. More importantly, a documented deterioration in exercise capacity over time in an otherwise asymptomatic patient might be an early sign of functional decline. Such a finding may be useful in defining optimal timing of intervention. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26371677\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and computed tomography (CT) can provide accurate, reliable, and reproducible assessment of cardiac structure and function in congenital heart disease when performed by an expert. These techniques offer certain advantages over echocardiography since they allow unrestricted evaluation of cardiac chambers and great arteries not compromised by air, bone, or surgical scar. Summation of disks on multiple tomographic slices during ventricular diastole and systole permits direct and accurate measurement of ventricular volume and function. Such data are helpful in determining timing of intervention or repair in adults with VSDs.

Although many defects close spontaneously before adulthood, many others persist and predispose to endocarditis, arrhythmias, heart failure, aortic regurgitation, double chambered right ventricle (DCRV), or pulmonary hypertension (PH). Therefore, periodic clinical evaluation is recommended. In the presence of aortic regurgitation, DCRV, or PH, such evaluation is best performed at an adult congenital heart disease center where the necessary medical, imaging and <span class=\"nowrap\">interventional/surgical</span> expertise is available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1364844\"><span class=\"h2\">Spontaneous closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous closure occurs in 40 to 60 percent of individuals with VSDs, predominantly during early childhood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical features of isolated ventricular septal defects in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Natural history'</a>.) In addition, spontaneous closure occurring between the ages of 17 and 45 years was observed in 10 percent of 188 adults with VSD followed for a mean of 13 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In a study of 236 isolated VSD, spontaneous closure occurred in four (1.3 percent) between the age of 17 and 33 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Closure results from muscular growth around the defect, ingrowth of border-forming proliferative fibrous tissue, or, in the case of membranous defects, from an aneurysm of the tricuspid valve leaflet adhering to the edge of the defect. Spontaneous closure occurs in some muscular and membranous defects but generally does not occur in inlet or infundibular defects. Although a VSD that has closed spontaneously is generally associated with an excellent prognosis, closure may prompt formation of an aneurysm of the membranous septum that may in turn cause tricuspid regurgitation, aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva with occasional rupture and rarely late RV outflow tract obstruction and heart block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1364851\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endocarditis risk persists in those with unrepaired VSD with an incidence of 22 to 24 per 10,000 patient years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].

Other risk factors for endocarditis include age &gt;20 years old and male sex. VSD size is not a significant risk factor for development of endocarditis.</p><p>When endocarditis is suspected, an echocardiogram is recommended to identify vegetations around the border of the VSD, within the defect, or on adjacent valves in the direction of the high velocity jet created by the VSD. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) remains the diagnostic procedure of choice in the evaluation of patients with suspected endocarditis given its greater sensitivity and specificity compared to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). However, TTE provides complementary imaging to TEE in patients with VSD and suspected endocarditis; thus, both are usually performed.

The reported incidence of ventricular tachycardias and sudden death in natural history studies of VSDs are 5.7 and 4.0 percent, respectively. In a series of patients with medically-managed VSD, age, and pulmonary artery pressure were the best predictors for ventricular arrhythmias on 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

The hypertrophied RV in these patients represents an ideal substrate for ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, some advocate annual Holter monitoring in patients with VSD and elevated right ventricular pressure. &#160;</p><p>Atrial arrhythmias, mostly atrial fibrillation, are also prevalent in adult VSD, especially with increasing age, left ventricular dysfunction, and elevated pulmonary artery pressure.

However, left-sided heart failure can develop in the setting of severe aortic regurgitation in association with a residual infundibular or membranous VSD. Right-sided heart failure may occur in adults with VSD and significant right ventricular hypertension from valvular pulmonic stenosis, DCRV, or PH, particularly with a failing right ventricle.

For patients with normal estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure, the 20-year survival rate was 97 percent. For patients with Eisenmenger complex, the 20-year survival rate was 54 percent. The most common reported causes of death in patients with VSD are heart failure and sudden death, followed by pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and endocarditis. </p><p>Patients with uncomplicated small VSDs, especially those involving the muscular and membranous septum, generally do very well as long as they do not develop left ventricular volume overload or pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a series of 229 patients with small VSDs, the reported rate of requiring closure was less than 1 percent during mean seven-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>A subsequent series reported late outcomes in 231 patients with isolated small VSDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The majority of patients (97 percent) were NYHA class I and no deaths were reported but 25 (11 percent) had endocarditis at median age 18 years. During follow-up, 26 (11 percent) underwent surgery for aortic regurgitation (one patient), LV enlargement (two), endocarditis (six), and DCRV (17). </p><p>In the NHS-2 study, nearly a third of initially medically managed patients with VSDs required VSD closure. However, patients with moderate shunts were included in the initially medically treated group. </p><p>Aortic regurgitation occurs 2.5 times more commonly with infundibular type VSD than membranous VSD because the associated deficiency or hypoplasia of the conal septum causes an anatomically unsupported right or left aortic valve cusp and sinus. As a result, the unsupported aortic valve cusp is driven into the right ventricle by Venturi effect, making the VSD smaller during systole. During diastole, intraaortic pressure causes the aortic valve cusps to close, but the unsupported cusp prolapses down into the left ventricular outflow tract away from the opposing cusps, resulting in aortic regurgitation that may become progressive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77305\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77305 \">figure 3</a>). The prevalence of aortic regurgitation increases with age (occurring in 87 percent of patients by age 20) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/10,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18</a>]. The progressive nature of the aortic regurgitation in the pediatric age group, the potential associated morbidity, along with improved surgical results with VSD and valve repair have led to the recommendation for early surgical intervention. </p><p>In contrast, a lower risk of aortic regurgitation progression was observed in a series of 62 adults (median age 41 years) with infundibular VSD, with freedom from aortic regurgitation progression of 86 percent at 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, there was a high risk of sinus of Valsalva aneurysm development (21 percent) in this cohort, even in those patients who had been repaired. In a separate series of 60 adults with infundibular VSD, rupture of sinus of Valsalva aneurysm was noted in five and endocarditis in three [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Therefore, watchful monitoring was recommended, especially in patients with aortic cusp prolapse.</p><p>Double chambered right ventricle (DCRV) occurs only in association with membranous VSD. Progressive hypertrophy of an aberrant right ventricular muscle bundle in the direction of the VSD jet creates a DCRV with a proximal high-pressure RV chamber in the RV inflow and a distal low-pressure RV chamber underneath the pulmonic valve. This condition develops in 3 to 10 percent of patients with membranous VSD and is characterized by the development of a loud crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur at the left sternal border, often associated with a thrill, replacing the typical holosystolic murmur of VSD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H26371633\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.) The resultant RV hypertrophy and right atrial enlargement are associated with ventricular and atrial arrhythmias, respectively. Although patients with VSD and DCRV may remain asymptomatic with severe obstruction, symptoms tend to develop during adult life. In a series of 50 patients with DCRV, symptoms occurred at median age of 26 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p>VSD with irreversible chronic pulmonary vascular obstructive disease (known as Eisenmenger complex) is rarely encountered in the current era due to recognition and closure of VSDs early in life. When VSDs are not identified or closed early in life, Eisenmenger complex may develop; these patients generally present with symptoms in the second and third decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Affected patients frequently present with dyspnea, cyanosis, chest pain, hemoptysis, arrhythmias, syncope, and secondary erythrocytosis. Patients with Eisenmenger complex are at risk for complications of cyanotic heart disease and severe pulmonary hypertension, which are discussed in detail separately.

Observational data suggest that surgical closure decreases the risk of endocarditis by at least half [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Observational series also suggest that surgical closure in patients with significant shunts reduces pulmonary artery pressure and improves long-term survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ventricular-septal-defect-in-adults/abstract/39,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,43</a>]. Therefore, repair of VSD should be considered in all adult patients who are symptomatic or have signs of left ventricular volume overload without irreversible pulmonary vascular disease and for those with complications related to the VSD, such as progressive aortic valve regurgitation. Observation is reserved for (1) asymptomatic patients with no evidence of left ventricular volume overload and (2) medical management is suggested for patients with symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> left ventricular volume overload who are <strong>not</strong> candidates for repair such as those with large defects and severe irreversible PH (Eisenmenger complex).

Although most patients with small VSDs do well during long-term follow-up, some develop complications. For example, in a series of 188 patients (mean age 29 years) with small, unoperated VSD, 47 percent had no complications during mean 13-year follow-up. Endocarditis and aortic regurgitation developed in 11 and 20 percent, respectively.
