This group of neoplasms exhibit behavior that is intermediate between benign cystadenomas and invasive carcinomas. These have been referred to by different terms, including: borderline, atypical proliferative, and tumors of low-malignant potential. Borderline neoplasm is currently the most widely used designation by pathologists, gynecologists, and oncologists, and has been adopted into the World Health Organization classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Borderline tumors account for 14 to 15 percent of all primary ovarian neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Borderline tumors occur in a variety of histologies, as in epithelial ovarian carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The majority of cases are serous or mucinous. Rarely, endometrioid, clear-cell, or transitional cell (Brenner) borderline tumors are found.</p><p>The histopathology of serous and mucinous borderline ovarian tumors is discussed briefly here. The histopathology of borderline ovarian neoplasms is discussed in detail separately.

Approximately 70 percent of cases are diagnosed at stage I [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, up to 50 percent of the time, serous borderline tumors are bilateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>Micropapillary features are present in 10 to 15 percent of serous borderline tumors, as well as in other types of benign and malignant serous ovarian tumors. The presence of micropapillary features is associated with an increased likelihood of both invasive peritoneal implants and of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2228074101\"><span class=\"h2\">Mucinous borderline tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mucinous tumors are the other common histologic type of borderline ovarian neoplasm; they account for approximately 11 percent of borderline tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. At diagnosis, the great majority are stage I (100 percent in one study of 15 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]). </p><p>Of note, mucinous tumors involving the ovary that are associated with pseudomyxoma peritonei are potentially of appendiceal origin, and therefore not a borderline ovarian tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer of the appendix and pseudomyxoma peritonei&quot;, section on 'Pseudomyxoma peritonei'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon registry data from the United States, Denmark, and Sweden, the estimated incidence of these tumors ranged from 1.8 to 5.5 per 100,000 women per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/4,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,15,16</a>]. Some data suggest that the incidence is increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As an example, a Danish study reported that the incidence of borderline ovarian tumors increased from 2.6 to 5.5 per 100,000 women-years between 1978 and 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Approximately one-third of women diagnosed with a borderline ovarian tumor are younger than 40 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. This makes issues related to ovarian function and fertility preservation of increased importance. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Future pregnancy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Hormone therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The majority of cases are diagnosed at stage I. As an example, in one literature review including 948 cases, 70 percent presented as stage I, 10 percent presented as stage II, 19 percent presented as stage III, and less than 1 percent presented as stage IV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Some data suggest that infertility or infertility treatments are associated with an increased risk of borderline tumors, but these data are limited by methodologic issues and a small number of cases. Regarding infertility, a meta-analysis of eight case-control studies reported a significant increase in the risk of borderline tumors in women with an unknown cause of infertility (odds ratio 1.86, 95% CI 1.26-2.74) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Data are mixed regarding the association between ovulation induction and borderline ovarian tumors. A systematic review including four observational studies found that use of any infertility drug was associated with a two to threefold increase in the risk of a borderline ovarian tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In contrast, a subsequent Danish population-based study (n = 142 cases of borderline tumors) found no increase in risk associated with fertility drug use; however, the study lacked sufficient statistical power [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The relationship between <em>BRCA</em> gene mutations and borderline ovarian tumors is uncertain. It appears that the prevalence of <em>BRCA</em> mutations is lower among women with borderline tumors than in women with invasive ovarian carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. As an example, in one study of Jewish women with ovarian neoplasms, the rate of <em>BRCA</em> mutations was higher in those with stage I ovarian carcinoma (24 percent of 256 women) than in those with borderline tumors (4 percent of 233 women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>Data are mixed regarding whether postmenopausal hormone therapy is associated with an increased risk of borderline tumors. A Danish national database study including 703 women with borderline ovarian tumors reported that four years of use of estrogen or estrogen and progestin therapy was associated with a 1.3 to 1.5-fold increased risk of a borderline tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In contrast, two other retrospective studies found limited or no association for most patients. One study found a significant increase in borderline tumors with two to three years of use, but not for other durations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Another study found a significant increase in risk only with unopposed estrogen in women who developed serous tumors, but not with combined estrogen and progestin therapy in either serous or mucinous tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H453805524\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of borderline ovarian tumors is the same as for other adnexal masses. Some patients are asymptomatic at presentation (14 percent in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Symptoms may include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic or abdominal pain or pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspareunia</p><p/><p>In contrast with women with ovarian carcinoma, those with borderline tumors are unlikely to present with ascites, bowel obstruction, pleural effusion, or venous thromboembolism.</p><p>In asymptomatic patients, borderline tumors may be detected incidentally as a mass noted on pelvic examination or imaging performed for another indication. In our experience, we suspect a borderline tumor in a younger patient with a relatively asymptomatic ovarian cyst that has evidence of internal papillary growth on ultrasound. </p><p>The clinical presentation of women with an adnexal mass or ovarian cancer is discussed in detail separately.

The sonographic appearance of borderline ovarian tumors ranges from unilocular cysts to masses with both solid and fluid components; papilla are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>].

This was the finding in a retrospective series of over 1000 women with borderline tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Almost half of all patients had a normal CA 125 level, and less than 25 percent had levels above 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span>. If the CA 125 level is high, ovarian cancer should be suspected.

The decision to proceed with surgery is based upon this indication.</p><p>Intraoperatively, in our experience, the gross appearance of a borderline tumor includes papillary excrescences (an appearance similar to cauliflower or coral).</p><p>As with other suspicious adnexal masses, the goal is to confirm the histology and proceed with the procedure that preserves fertility and ovarian function, if possible. If an ovarian mass is suspected to be malignant, the standard procedure is to remove the ovary intact and send it for frozen section. However, if a mass is suspected to be benign or borderline, a cystectomy may be performed. If both ovaries are involved, the lesion that appears more suspicious should be removed and sent for frozen pathology.</p><p>If the histology shows a borderline neoplasm or invasive disease, staging is performed, which may include ovarian conservation. In any surgery for an adnexal mass that has the potential to be borderline or malignant, preoperative counseling should include discussion of patient preferences and options regarding ovarian conservation versus complete staging. (See <a href=\"#H1028405\" class=\"local\">'Complete staging versus conservative surgery'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2228074579\"><span class=\"h3\">Frozen section</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Frozen section is commonly performed intraoperatively and the information is used to help determine the extent of the surgical procedure. A meta-analysis of 18 studies on the diagnostic accuracy of frozen section results of ovarian pathology found generally good sensitivity (65 to 100 percent) and excellent specificity (&gt;99 percent) when compared with the final histologic diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Factors that lower the sensitivity of frozen section diagnosis of malignancy include large neoplasms, mucinous tumors (which have more histologic variation), and borderline tumors, since all require a large number of sections to exclude the presence of a focal area of invasive disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H453805687\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Borderline ovarian neoplasm is a histologic diagnosis. This evaluation is performed following surgical removal of an ovary.

The low prognostic utility of lymph node sampling was illustrated in a meta-analysis of 97 studies including over 4000 patients with ovarian tumors of low-malignant potential that reported 98 percent survival at 6.5 years in women with lymph node involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1028405\"><span class=\"h2\">Complete staging versus conservative surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of full staging or ovary-conserving surgery is controversial. Approximately one-third of borderline ovarian tumors occur in women younger than 40 years of age, and many young women desire to conserve at least one ovary to preserve fertility <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> avoid the symptoms and effects of premature menopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. Ovarian borderline tumors are not a common condition and most data derive from retrospective cases series of less than 100 patients.</p><p>The disease has a good prognosis (stage I five-year survival is 99 percent) and unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (USO) appears to be an option for women with unilateral disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>]. Some data suggest that ovarian cystectomy is also acceptable.

The efficacy of conservative surgery in early-stage disease was best illustrated in a systematic review and meta-analysis of 120 mostly retrospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. For women with stage I ovarian borderline tumors treated with either USO or ovarian cystectomy, with an average follow-up of three to six years, the borderline recurrence rate was 13 percent, recurrence with malignant disease was 1.6 percent, and the death rate was 0.5 percent. This study was limited because it combined data for USO and cystectomy.</p><p>Some data suggest that USO is more effective than ovarian cystectomy, especially if the margins are positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/37,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,42,43</a>]. The two procedures were compared in a retrospective series of 193 patients with borderline ovarian tumors that was included in the systematic review described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/39,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,41</a>]. In this study, the five-year disease-free survival rate for all patients was approximately 95 percent. The recurrence rate was higher and recurrence occurred sooner after cystectomy. For USO, 10 of 146 (7 percent) women had recurrences and the median time to recurrence was 4.8 years (range, 1.7 to 7.2 years); two of the recurrences were malignant disease. For cystectomy, 11 of 47 (23 percent) women recurred and the median time to recurrence was 2.6 years (range, 0.3 to 14 years); there were no malignant recurrences.</p><p>Recurrence of borderline disease requires surgical resection, typically full staging. If no malignant disease is present, borderline recurrences are not associated with mortality. In some cases, even after a recurrence, the uterus and one ovary or part of an ovary may be conserved to retain fertility.</p><p>For women with advanced-stage disease, full staging with TAH-BSO appears to be more effective, and the risk of progression to invasive disease is clinically significant. In a study of patients with stage I to III disease, tumor recurrence rates after TAH-BSO, adnexectomy, and cystectomy were 6, 15, and 36 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

All macroscopic disease should be resected. Appendectomy is performed for mucinous tumors.</p><p>Borderline tumors may be discovered inadvertently in a woman undergoing surgery for a presumed benign ovarian mass. If the patient may desire future reproduction, conservative surgery is performed. If surgical expertise for staging is available, additional biopsies of omentum or other peritoneal lesions may be performed. Peritoneal washings should be sent and appendectomy should be performed in women with mucinous tumors. If the final pathology demonstrates a more aggressive (invasive) lesion, additional surgical staging may be performed at a later time. If future reproduction is not desired, full staging may also be considered.</p><p>It is controversial whether patients who have fertility-conserving surgery should undergo removal of a remaining ovary or uterus upon completion of childbearing. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) advises consideration of completion surgery upon completion of childbearing for women with a remaining ovary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Based on the low recurrence rate of borderline tumors and the low risk of malignancy, in our practice, we do not routinely perform completion surgery in these women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>In addition, if an ovarian borderline tumor or malignancy is suspected preoperatively, patients who desire to retain fertility should be offered a consultation with a fertility specialist to review options, including embryo or oocyte cryopreservation.

At 81-month follow-up, there was no significant difference in the recurrence rate for women who underwent bilateral cystectomy compared with standard surgery, unilateral oophorectomy combined with contralateral cystectomy (60 versus 59 percent). Recurrence occurred sooner in the bilateral cystectomy group (16 versus 48 months), and multiple recurrences were more likely (23 versus 0 percent). There were no invasive recurrences. Fertility outcomes were better following bilateral cystectomy (pregnancy rates: 93 versus 53 percent).

The largest of these reports consisted of 80 patients with stage II to IV serous borderline tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. No patient with stage II disease received adjuvant chemotherapy, while of the 65 patients with stage III or IV disease, 17 received adjuvant chemotherapy (with a variety of both intravenous and intraperitoneal regimens) and the remainder did not. None of the patients with residual disease after initial surgery received chemotherapy. Major findings were that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment with chemotherapy was associated with a lower progression-free survival rate at three years compared with no treatment (71 versus 90 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At a median follow-up of 4.8 years, 17 (21 percent) developed recurrent disease, all of whom had metastasis to the omentum or to multiple sites at original presentation. The sites of recurrent disease included pelvis in 15, omentum in 29, isolated lymph nodes in two, axilla in one, and multiple sites in 32.</p><p/><p>Thus, the use of chemotherapy did not appear to impact the risk of recurrence. Given the apparently favorable outcome of advanced-stage serous borderline tumors, and the fact that a survival benefit from administration of adjuvant chemotherapy has not been clearly demonstrated, most clinicians recommend chemotherapy after aggressive surgical debulking only if invasive implants are identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-ovarian-tumors/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Posttreatment surveillance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no high quality evidence to support one posttreatment surveillance strategy over another.

These tumors account for 14 to 15 percent of ovarian epithelial tumors. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9972461\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of borderline tumors are serous. Approximately 75 percent of patients are diagnosed with stage I disease; 25 to 50 percent of tumors are bilateral. Mucinous tumors are the other common cellular type; 90 percent are stage I and less than 10 percent are bilateral. (See <a href=\"#H9972461\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated incidence of these tumors ranges from 1.8 to 5.5 per 100,000 women per year. Approximately one-third of women diagnosed with a borderline ovarian tumor are younger than 40 years of age. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients present with an asymptomatic adnexal mass noted either on bimanual examination or as an incidental finding on sonography; however, symptoms (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">abdominal/pelvic</span> pain or dyspareunia) may occur, as with any adnexal mass. (See <a href=\"#H453805524\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no sonographic features strongly suggestive of borderline histology. Sonographic appearance ranges from unilocular cysts to masses with both solid and fluid components; papilla are common. Measurement of CA 125 does not reliably predict borderline histology. (See <a href=\"#H2228074175\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of these neoplasms is based upon histopathologic examination. Frozen section is commonly performed intraoperatively and the information is used to help determine the extent of the surgical procedure. (See <a href=\"#H453805687\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Borderline tumors are staged using the same criteria as other ovarian neoplasms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545 \">table 3</a>). Most women present with stage I disease (approximately 70 percent); stage II to IV disease is relatively infrequent.

For women with borderline ovarian tumors who are postmenopausal or who do not wish to preserve fertility or endocrine function, a full staging procedure with TAH-BSO is performed. Informed consent should include counseling premenopausal patients about the symptoms, effects, and management options for premature menopause.

Appendectomy is performed for mucinous tumors. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is required in patients with bilateral borderline ovarian tumors. (See <a href=\"#H16134900\" class=\"local\">'Desire fertility preservation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of adjuvant chemotherapy is controversial; there is no advantage to treatment of women with early-stage disease. While patients with more advanced disease may be rendered disease-free, survival benefit related to the administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has not been clearly demonstrated. We recommend chemotherapy after aggressive surgical debulking only if invasive implants are identified (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no evidence that estrogens stimulate the growth of borderline serous or mucinous tumors of the ovary, or that their use in any way adversely affects the likelihood of relapse or survival. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Hormone therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Borderline tumors have an excellent prognosis (stage I five-year survival is 99 percent). The risk of malignant transformation is unclear. Progression to invasive cancer may represent true transformation, de novo development of an ovarian cancer, or a peritoneal cancer.
