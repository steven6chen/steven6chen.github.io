They act by diminishing sodium reabsorption at different sites in the nephron, thereby increasing urinary sodium and water losses. The ability to induce negative fluid balance has made diuretics useful in the treatment of a variety of conditions, particularly edematous states and hypertension.</p><p>A review of the mechanism and time course of action of diuretics will be presented here. Diuretic dosing and adverse effects are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loop-diuretics-maximum-effective-dose-and-major-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Loop diuretics: Maximum effective dose and major side effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=time-course-of-loop-and-thiazide-diuretic-induced-electrolyte-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Time course of loop and thiazide diuretic-induced electrolyte complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diuretics are generally divided into four major classes, which are distinguished by the site at which they impair sodium reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loop diuretics act in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thiazide-type diuretics in the distal tubule and connecting segment (and perhaps the early cortical collecting tubule)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potassium-sparing diuretics in the aldosterone-sensitive principal cells in the cortical collecting tubule</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetazolamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> act at least in part in the proximal tubule</p><p/><p>To appreciate how diuretics act, it is first necessary to review the general mechanism by which sodium is reabsorbed. Each of the sodium-transporting cells contains Na-K-ATPase pumps in the basolateral membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These pumps perform two major functions: they return reabsorbed sodium to the systemic circulation; and they maintain the cell sodium concentration at relatively low levels. The latter effect is particularly important since it allows filtered sodium to enter the cells down a favorable concentration gradient via carrier-mediated transport.</p><p>This process must be mediated by a transmembrane carrier or a sodium channel since charged particles cannot freely cross the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. Each of the major nephron segments has one or more unique sodium entry mechanisms and the ability to specifically inhibit this step explains the nephron segment at which the different classes of diuretics act.</p><p>The site of action within the nephron is a major determinant of diuretic potency. Most of the filtered sodium is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule (about 60 to 65 percent) and the loop of Henle (20 percent). As a result, it might be expected that a proximally acting diuretic, such as the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a>, could induce relatively large losses of sodium and water. However, this does not occur, since almost all of the excess fluid delivered out of the proximal tubule can be reabsorbed more distally, particularly in the loop of Henle and to a lesser degree the distal tubule. Transport in these segments is primarily flow dependent, varying directly with the delivery of chloride [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>A similar process of distal compensation occurs with the administration of loop diuretics, as some of the extra sodium chloride leaving the loop of Henle is reabsorbed in the distal tubule. With chronic loop diuretic therapy, animal studies have demonstrated both distal tubular hypertrophy and a rise in Na-K-ATPase activity in distal tubular cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. A similar increase in distal tubular sodium reabsorption appears to occur in humans as demonstrated by an enhanced diuresis following administration of a thiazide diuretic after chronic therapy with a loop diuretic compared to placebo (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F53198\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53198 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, the reabsorptive capacity of the distal and collecting tubules is relatively limited and, in most circumstances, the natriuretic response to a loop diuretic is not seriously impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Loop diuretics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When administered at maximum dose, the loop diuretics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bumetanide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethacrynic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethacrynic acid</a>, can lead to the excretion of up to 20 to 25 percent of filtered sodium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>]. They act in the medullary and cortical aspects of the thick ascending limb, including the macula densa cells in the early distal tubule. At each of these sites, sodium entry is primarily mediated by a Na-K-2Cl carrier in the luminal membrane that is activated when all four sites are occupied (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F75301\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75301 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/1,5,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,11,12</a>]. The loop diuretics appear to compete for the chloride site on this carrier, thereby diminishing net reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Inhibition of an isoform of this cotransporter in the inner ear is thought to be responsible for the ototoxicity that is rarely seen with high dose intravenous loop diuretic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of refractory edema in adults&quot;, section on 'Risk of ototoxicity'</a>.)</p><p>Loop diuretics also have important effects on renal calcium handling. The reabsorption of calcium in the loop of Henle is primarily passive, being driven by the electrochemical gradient created by NaCl transport and occurring through the paracellular pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. As a result, inhibiting the reabsorption of NaCl leads to a parallel reduction in that of calcium, thereby increasing calcium excretion. In the past, saline plus high doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> was a mainstay of the treatment of hypercalcemia. Volume expansion is still important, but other drugs, such as bisphosphonates, have largely replaced loop diuretics in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypercalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypercalcemia&quot;</a>.) </p><p>A potential concern is that the calciuric response can lead to kidney stones <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nephrocalcinosis. These complications have been primarily reported in premature infants in whom a loop diuretic can induce more than a 10-fold rise in calcium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Thiazide diuretics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The thiazide diuretics primarily inhibit sodium transport in the distal tubule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/1,2,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,18-20</a>], the connecting segment at the end of the distal tubule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], and possibly the cortical collecting tubule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. These segments reabsorb a smaller proportion of the filtered load than the loop of Henle; as a result, the thiazide-type diuretics have a smaller natriuretic effect than loop diuretics and, when given in maximum dose, inhibit the reabsorption of at most 3 to 5 percent of filtered sodium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Furthermore, the net diuresis may be partially limited by increased reabsorption in the cortical collecting tubule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/7,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,25</a>]. These characteristics make the thiazides less useful in the treatment of edematous states (unless given in combination with a loop diuretic for resistant edema), but are not a problem in uncomplicated hypertension where marked fluid loss is neither necessary nor desirable. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-refractory-edema-in-adults#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of refractory edema in adults&quot;, section on 'Thiazide plus loop diuretics'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-thiazide-diuretics-in-patients-with-primary-essential-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of thiazide diuretics in patients with primary (essential) hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thiazide-sensitive sodium entry in the distal nephron is mediated by neutral Na-Cl cotransport&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/1,18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18,21</a>]. Both a Na-Cl cotransporter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F64975\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64975 \">figure 3</a>) and, to a lesser degree, parallel Na-H and Cl-HCO3 exchangers are responsible for NaCl reabsorption at these sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/1,21,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21,26</a>].</p><p>The thiazides inhibit NaCl reabsorption in these segments by competing for the chloride site on the transporters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Some of these drugs (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorothiazide</a>) also modestly impair sodium transport in the proximal tubule, due to partial inhibition of carbonic anhydrase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/19,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,29</a>]. This does not normally contribute to the net diuresis, however, since the excess fluid delivered out of the proximal tubule is reclaimed in the loop of Henle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>As with the loop diuretics, the thiazides also affect calcium handling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The distal tubule is the major site of active calcium reabsorption in the nephron, an effect that is independent of sodium transport [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Although the thiazides inhibit the reabsorption of sodium in this segment, they also increase the reabsorption of calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A similar response appears to occur in the cortical collecting tubule, as the potassium-sparing diuretic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a> can promote calcium reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The fall in calcium excretion can be useful in the treatment of recurrent kidney stones due to hypercalciuria; this hypocalciuric response is mediated by diuretic-induced alterations in intracellular composition and electrical potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent calcium stones in adults&quot;, section on 'High urine calcium'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Potassium-sparing diuretics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The four potassium-sparing diuretics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamterene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamterene</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eplerenone</a>, act in the principal cells in the cortical collecting tubule (and possibly in the papillary or inner medullary collecting duct) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Sodium entry in these segments occurs through aldosterone-sensitive sodium channels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60693\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60693 \">figure 4</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. The reabsorption of cationic sodium without an anion creates a lumen-negative electrical gradient that then favors the secretion of potassium (through selective potassium channels) and hydrogen ions. Thus, inhibition of sodium reabsorption at this site can lead to hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis due to the concurrent reductions in potassium and hydrogen ion excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The potassium-sparing diuretics decrease the number of open sodium channels in the principal cells by two different mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiloride</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamterene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamterene</a> are cations that directly decrease sodium channel activity but do not affect the mineralocorticoid receptor. Another cation, the antibiotic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a>, also can act as a potassium-sparing diuretic when given in high doses (eg, to treat Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with AIDS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrolyte-disturbances-with-hiv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrolyte disturbances with HIV infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Spironolactone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eplerenone</a> competitively inhibit the mineralocorticoid receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Eplerenone is better tolerated than spironolactone since it has greater specificity for the mineralocorticoid receptor, resulting in a lower incidence of endocrine side effects (eg, gynecomastia, menstrual abnormalities, impotence, and decreased libido) that are mediated by nonselective binding to estrogen and progesterone receptors. However, eplerenone may be substantially more expensive. In patients treated with diuretics, mineralocorticoid receptor inhibitors may also act in the distal tubule, diminishing the number of Na-Cl cotransporters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].<br/><br/>Spironolactone or eplerenone is specifically indicated in patients with primary aldosteronism or heart failure because blocking the mineralocorticoid receptor may reduce the adverse effects of excess aldosterone on the heart. These drugs are also preferred in patients with cirrhosis.

Thus, they are primarily used in combination with a loop or thiazide diuretic, occasionally to cause additional sodium excretion but more commonly to diminish the degree of potassium loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

Blocking these channels with amiloride partially reverses and may even prevent the concentrating defect, presumably by diminishing lithium entry into the tubular cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

It can be given once a day and is associated with few side effects other than hyperkalemia. Triamterene, in comparison, is a potential nephrotoxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], possibly leading to crystalluria and cast formation (in up to one-half of patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], and rarely to triamterene stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>] or to acute renal failure due either to intratubular crystal deposition or the concurrent use of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. These stones, which are more likely to occur in patients with a prior history of stone disease, are faintly radiopaque; their formation is pH-independent, and they usually contain some calcium oxalate (although pure triamterene stones can occur) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/42,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,45</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-hyponatremia-in-adults#H1305585899\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of hyponatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Vasopressin receptor antagonists'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TIME COURSE OF DIURESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of a diuretic is related to a number of factors, including its site of action, its duration of action, and dietary salt intake. As an example, a short-acting loop diuretic, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, produces a significant natriuresis during the six-hour period that the diuretic is acting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Sodium excretion then falls to very low levels during the remaining 18 hours of the day, because the associated volume depletion leads to the activation of sodium-retaining mechanisms.</p><p>The net result in patients on a high sodium intake is that there is no net sodium loss. In this setting, one or more of the following changes must be present to induce a negative sodium balance:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient can be placed on a low-sodium diet, thereby minimizing the degree of sodium retention once the diuretic effect has dissipated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. This is the preferred method since it can also limit concurrent potassium losses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diuretic can be given two or more times per day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dose of the diuretic can be increased, although the larger initial diuresis may induce symptomatic hypovolemia.</p><p/><p>Several factors contribute to the compensatory antinatriuresis following the institution of diuretic therapy. The initial fluid loss leads to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems; angiotensin II, aldosterone, and norepinephrine can all promote tubular sodium reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. However, in a study of normal volunteers who were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, blocking both of these pathways with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prazosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prazosin</a> (an alpha-1-adrenergic blocker) and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor did not prevent the secondary renal sodium retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In this setting in which both vasoconstrictor hormones were inhibited, there was a mean 13 mmHg fall in the systemic blood pressure. Hypotension, in the absence of neurohumoral activation, directly promotes sodium retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/52,58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,58,59</a>]. </p><p>These observations permit a more complete understanding of the volume regulatory actions of angiotensin II and norepinephrine. In the presence of volume depletion, the combined vasoconstrictor and sodium-retaining effects of these hormones result in both maintenance of the systemic blood pressure and an appropriate fall in sodium excretion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Reestablishment of the steady state</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even if a net diuresis is induced, the diuretic response at a given dose is short-lived as a new steady state is rapidly established in which sodium intake and output are again equal but the extracellular volume has fallen due to the initial period of negative sodium balance. In this setting, the diuretic-induced sodium losses are counterbalanced by several factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurohumorally mediated increases in tubular reabsorption at nondiuretic sensitive sites, such as the proximal tubule (due to angiotensin II and to a lesser degree norepinephrine) and the collecting tubules (due to aldosterone) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flow-mediated increases in tubular reabsorption distal to the site of action of the diuretic as distal sodium delivery is enhanced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. Administration of a loop diuretic, for example, leads to hypertrophy and increased Na-K-ATPase activity in both the distal and collecting tubules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. A thiazide diuretic, on the other hand, acts in the distal tubule and the distal adaptations are limited to the Na-reabsorbing cells in the collecting tubules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/7,8,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diminished diuretic entry to the intratubular sites of action also may contribute if renal perfusion becomes impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p/><p>The attainment and maintenance of the new steady state requires that both diuretic dose and sodium intake are relatively constant. This limitation on the net diuresis is physiologically appropriate since progressive volume depletion and shock would eventually ensue if urinary sodium excretion were persistently greater than intake.</p><p>What is generally underappreciated is how rapidly the steady state is reestablished. This issue was addressed in a study in which three normal subjects on a constant sodium and potassium intake were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrochlorothiazide</a> at a dose of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Sodium was lost for only three days and potassium for six to nine days; after this period, intake and output were again equal, but the early losses persisted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F74940\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74940 \">figure 5</a>). Other studies in stable patients have shown that the maximum diuresis occurs after the <strong>first dose</strong> of the diuretic. As soon as fluid loss occurs, activation of sodium-retaining mechanisms will limit the response to the second dose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F75714\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75714 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Similarly, the response to a continuous intravenous diuretic infusion attenuates over time on the first day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F75714\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75714 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p>A similar course in which there is a limited duration of diuresis at a constant diuretic dose occurs in edematous states, such as heart failure and cirrhosis. In heart failure, for example, the diuretic-induced reduction in cardiac filling pressures leads to a decline in cardiac output and activation of the renin-angiotensin system, both of which promote sodium retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of diuretics in patients with heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These findings are important clinically for patients treated with diuretics. As long as dose and dietary intake are stable, all of the fluid and electrolyte complications associated with diuretics occur within the first four weeks of therapy. As an example, suppose a patient with primary hypertension (formerly called &quot;essential&quot; hypertension) is treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> at a dose of 12.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. At four weeks, the blood pressure has fallen to the goal level and the plasma creatinine, sodium, and potassium concentrations remain within the normal range. Late volume depletion, hypokalemia, or hyponatremia are not likely to occur and repeat blood tests at every visit are not necessary, unless some new problem, such as vomiting or diarrhea, is superimposed. Sequential evaluation of patients with hypertension has revealed that all of the fall in the plasma potassium concentration following therapy with a thiazide diuretic occurs within the first two to four weeks, with subsequent stabilization at the new level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Similar considerations apply to the use of a potassium-sparing diuretic to correct thiazide-induced hypokalemia; the plasma potassium concentration rises during the first two to three weeks and then remains relatively constant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanism-of-action-of-diuretics/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>The sequence is different in patients who are markedly volume expanded due to renal sodium retention (eg, in acute glomerulonephritis). In this setting, the renin-angiotensin system is suppressed and will not be activated by initial sodium loss, since hypervolemia persists. Thus, the second and subsequent doses may produce as large a natriuresis as the original dose until most of the excess fluid has been removed. Even in this setting, however, the first dose still represents the maximum response that will be seen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12234229\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diuretics diminish sodium reabsorption at different sites in the nephron, thereby increasing urinary sodium and water losses. The four major classes of diuretics, which are distinguished by the site at which they act, include loop, thiazide-type, and potassium-sparing diuretics, and diuretics that act in the proximal tubule such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>.
