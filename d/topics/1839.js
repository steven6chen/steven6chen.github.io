Wetting the bed at night is common in young children. By age 4, most children can control their bladder when they are awake. But it can take longer for children to have control over their bladder when they are sleeping. Some children do not stop wetting the bed at night until they are 5 to 7 years old. Bedwetting is more common in boys than in girls, and can run in families.</p><p>Most children will stop bedwetting on their own and do not need any treatment. But if you are worried or have questions about your child's bedwetting, talk with your child's doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46413175\"><span class=\"h1\">Why do children wet the bed?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bedwetting is most likely to happen when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A child's bladder muscles develop more slowly than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A child's bladder holds a smaller than normal amount of urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A child's body makes a lot of urine</p><p/><p>Most of the time, bedwetting is not caused by a medical or emotional problem. In some cases, though, it is. Your doctor should be able to tell if your child's bedwetting is caused by a medical problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46413182\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to try to stop my child's bedwetting?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can try different things at home to stop your child's bedwetting. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child urinate before going to bed. Remind him or her to wake up and use the toilet when needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put night lights in the hall and bathroom so your child can find the toilet easily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop using diapers or training pants at home, especially if your child is older than 8. Your child can still wear those items for overnight visits with family and friends.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have your child help with clean up in the morning. For example, he or she can take the wet sheet off the bed or help with laundry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep a chart of your child's progress and give rewards when your child stays dry. You and your child should agree on the rewards ahead of time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spread out your child's drinks over the whole day. Do not have your child drink a lot right before bedtime.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help your child teach his or her bladder to hold more urine. Have your child hold his or her urine for longer periods of time before urinating.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a night-time bedwetting alarm. These have special sensors that set off an alarm when the child wets the bed. They work best in children ages 7 and older. Talk with your doctor about which type of alarm is best for your child and how to use it.</p><p/><p>For any of these plans to work, both you and your child must want the bedwetting to stop. Stopping bedwetting can be very hard to do and can take a long time.</p><p>Remember that children cannot help their bedwetting. You should never get mad at, punish, or tease your child for wetting the bed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46413189\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tips for how to keep my child's bed clean and dry?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Use a waterproof sheet to protect the mattress and avoid urine odor. When your child wets the bed at night, have him or her use the toilet before putting on dry pajamas. Then, put a dry towel on the wet part of the bed. You can also make the bed in layers, alternating sheets with waterproof pads. Then, when your child wets the bed, you can just take the wet sheet off without needing to re-make the bed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46413196\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should see your doctor or nurse if your child:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feels the need to urinate more than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is more thirsty than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a burning feeling when he or she urinates</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has swelling of the feet or ankles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Starts wetting the bed again after being dry for weeks or months</p><p/><p>These symptoms can be a sign of a medical problem. Your child's doctor will want to check him or her. The doctor will do an exam and might order tests, including a urine test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46413203\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there medicines that can reduce bedwetting?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are medicines doctors can prescribe to reduce bedwetting. But medicines are usually given to children older than 7 who have already tried many other ways to stop bedwetting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46413210\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bedwetting-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bedwetting in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=toilet-training-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Toilet training (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
