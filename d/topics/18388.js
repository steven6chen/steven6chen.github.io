Given the difference in mechanisms, it was previously postulated that ARB therapy would provide an advantage over ACE inhibitor therapy but the evidence has shown that ARB therapy is not superior to ACE inhibitor therapy for heart failure (HF). </p><p>ACE inhibitors block the formation of angiotensin II, thereby decreasing the amount of angiotensin available to both AT type 1 (AT1) and AT type 2 (AT2) receptors. ARBs selectively block the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor, but do not affect the AT2 receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-angiotensin-ii-receptor-blocker-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The accumulation of kinins may mediate some of the benefits as well as the adverse effects of ACE inhibitors. One important clinical consequence resulting from the lack of kinin accumulation is that the ARBs do not induce cough, a complication that occurs in 3 to 20 percent of patients treated with ACE inhibitors.

The above recommendation does <strong>not</strong> apply when the ACE inhibitor intolerance involves hyperkalemia or renal insufficiency, in which case the same risks would apply to an ARB. For patients who have developed angioedema on an ACE inhibitor, we suggest cautiously substituting an ARB since angioedema has been infrequently reported with ARB therapy. (See <a href=\"#H866463016\" class=\"local\">'Indications for use of angiotensin II receptor blocker'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Compared with ACE inhibitor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When an ARB is indicated, we favor use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candesartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">candesartan</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valsartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valsartan</a> based on the availability of direct evidence from clinical trials. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Evidence on angiotensin II receptor blocker'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Agent and dose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with HFrEF, angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) therapy reduced hospitalizations for HF and produced a borderline statistically significant reduction in mortality compared to placebo. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Intolerant of ACE inhibitor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine use of the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB is potentially harmful and should be avoided. The addition of an ARB to an ACE inhibitor in patients with HFrEF reduces risk of hospitalization for HF but does not reduce total hospitalizations or improve survival. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were more frequent with combination ARB plus ACE inhibitor therapy. (See <a href=\"#H4526290\" class=\"local\">'Addition of ARB to ACE inhibitor does not improve survival'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adverse effects of ARBs include hypotension, dizziness, worsening renal function, and hyperkalemia.
