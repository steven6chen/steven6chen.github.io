PCOS can be readily diagnosed when women present with the classic features of hirsutism, irregular menstrual cycles, obesity (in some, but not all, populations), and polycystic ovarian morphology on transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS). However, there has been considerable controversy about specific diagnostic criteria when not all of these classic features are evident.</p><p>The diagnosis of PCOS will be reviewed here. The epidemiology and pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatment of PCOS are described in detail separately. The diagnosis of PCOS in adolescents is also reviewed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>PCOS is thought to be one of the most common endocrinopathies in women, affecting between 5 and 12 percent of women, depending upon the population studied (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-genetics-of-the-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and genetics of the polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>). The syndrome is characterized clinically by oligomenorrhea and hyperandrogenism, as well as the frequent presence of associated risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including obesity, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, fatty liver, and obstructive sleep apnea. Other features include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menstrual dysfunction &ndash; The menstrual irregularity typically begins in the peripubertal period, and menarche may be delayed. The menstrual pattern is typically one of oligomenorrhea (fewer than nine menstrual periods in a year) and, less often, amenorrhea (no menstrual periods for three or more consecutive months). Women with PCOS often experience more regular cycles after age 40 years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Menstrual dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperandrogenism &ndash; Hyperandrogenism may include clinical signs (acne, hirsutism, male-pattern hair loss) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> elevated serum androgen concentrations (ie, hyperandrogenemia) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Female pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia in women): Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>). Most women with PCOS have both clinical and biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism. Signs of more severe androgen excess (virilization), such as deepening of the voice and clitoromegaly, occur rarely and suggest the possibility of ovarian hyperthecosis or an androgen-secreting tumor. (See <a href=\"#H2549171686\" class=\"local\">'Severe hyperandrogenism/virilization'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hirsutism is defined as excess terminal (thick, pigmented) body hair in a male distribution and may be noted above the upper lip, chin, periareolar area, in the midsternum, and along the linea alba of the lower abdomen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73544\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73544 \">picture 1</a>). There is substantial ethnic variability in hirsutism; Asian women with PCOS, as an example, have a lesser degree of hirsutism, than do non-Hispanic white or African American women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-causes-of-hirsutism#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and causes of hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Ethnicity'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polycystic ovaries &ndash; The typical polycystic appearance of the ovaries is seen on transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) in the majority of women with irregular menses and hyperandrogenism. However, this ultrasound appearance is nonspecific as it may also be seen in normal-cycling women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults#H552092013\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Ultrasound appearance'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metabolic <span class=\"nowrap\">issues/cardiovascular</span> risks &ndash; Approximately 40 to 85 percent of women with PCOS are overweight or obese compared with age-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Insulin resistance is present in both lean and obese women with PCOS (30 and 70 percent, respectively) compared with age- and weight-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with PCOS are also at increased risk for type 2 diabetes. There are concerns that women with PCOS are at higher risk than women without PCOS for coronary heart disease, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, but data are inconclusive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'IGT/type 2 diabetes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults#H261221887\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Coronary heart disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other clinical manifestations related to PCOS include nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and sleep apnea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults#H261221120\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults#H342301178\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Sleep apnea'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mood &ndash; There is evidence that PCOS is associated with mood disorders (depression and anxiety), impaired quality of life, and eating disorders (binge eating, even when compared with women with the same body mass index [BMI]). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults#H342300978\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Psychosocial issues'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2857069684\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2574299161\"><span class=\"h2\">When to suspect PCOS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of PCOS should be suspected in any women of reproductive age who presents with irregular menses and symptoms of hyperandrogenism (acne, hirsutism, male-pattern hair loss). The presence of overweight or obesity should further raise suspicion. Some women present with either oligomenorrhea or hyperandrogenic symptoms alone. They should also be evaluated for PCOS, particularly those with hyperandrogenism (as most women with hirsutism have PCOS). Women with polycystic ovaries on ultrasound and no other clinical features of PCOS (hyperandrogenism or menstrual dysfunction) do not have PCOS and need no further evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H2233346013\" class=\"local\">'Transvaginal ultrasound'</a> below.)</p><p>Lastly, it is important to have a high index of suspicion for PCOS because these women may have associated risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including obesity, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, fatty liver, and obstructive sleep apnea that require evaluation and treatment. (See <a href=\"#H176328674\" class=\"local\">'Cardiometabolic risk assessment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3200266717\"><span class=\"h3\">Delays in diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early diagnosis and intervention are important in women with PCOS for quality of life and well-being.<strong> </strong>However, most women with PCOS describe a<strong> </strong>poor diagnosis experience related to long delays and inadequate health information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a cross-sectional, international study of diagnosis experiences in over 1300 women with PCOS (using online questionnaires), almost half saw three or more health professionals prior to diagnosis, and for one-third, it took over two years before their diagnosis was made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, only 16 percent were satisfied with the health information and educational materials they received. These observations highlight opportunities for improving care for women with PCOS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1575001986\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Using the Rotterdam criteria, many patients can be diagnosed based upon the history and physical (eg, a history of irregular menses and clinical signs of hyperandrogenism: acne, hirsutism, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> male-pattern hair loss). As noted above, irregular menses typically begin in the teenage years. Women who develop oligomenorrhea at a much later age (eg, &gt;30 years) are less likely to have PCOS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-secondary-amenorrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of secondary amenorrhea&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We suggest using the Ferriman-Gallwey score to assess the degree of hirsutism on physical exam (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66629 \">figure 1</a>). However, there are a number of limitations to this approach in clinical practice. Most importantly, the expression of hair growth varies among <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> groups. Most East Asian and Native American women have little body hair, white and African American women have an intermediate amount, and most Mediterranean, South Asian, and Middle Eastern women have substantially greater quantities of body hair, even though serum androgen concentrations are similar in all groups. Therefore, even a minimal amount of acne or facial hair in an East Asian or Native American women should raise suspicion for a hyperandrogenic disorder, most commonly, PCOS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism#H124279391\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Ferriman-Gallwey score'</a>.)</p><p>Women with evidence of virilization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hirsutism of recent onset that is rapidly progressive need immediate evaluation for the most serious causes of hyperandrogenism (ovarian and adrenal androgen-secreting tumors). (See <a href=\"#H2549171686\" class=\"local\">'Severe hyperandrogenism/virilization'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1191653988\" class=\"local\">'Androgen-secreting tumors/ovarian hyperthecosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3727155361\"><span class=\"h2\">Biochemical testing</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2659188992\"><span class=\"h3\">Women with hyperandrogenism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest measuring serum androgens in women with hyperandrogenic symptoms (with or without oligomenorrhea). Most women who present with hirsutism have PCOS, but it is essential to identify those who have other disorders such as NCCAH, or a more serious cause (androgen-secreting tumors and ovarian hyperthecosis). The approach to ruling out other disorders is similar to the evaluation of women with hirsutism, 75 to 80 percent of whom have PCOS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2316287915\"><span class=\"h4\">Normal menstrual cycles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with hyperandrogenic symptoms (most commonly hirsutism) and normal menstrual cycles are most likely to fall into the category of PCOS or idiopathic hirsutism and are unlikely to have a more serious cause for their hirsutism. For these women, we suggest measuring only a serum total testosterone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism#H2647155849\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Hirsutism and normal menstrual cycles'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3970071755\"><span class=\"h4\">Oligomenorrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with hyperandrogenic symptoms and oligomenorrhea, we suggest measuring a serum total testosterone, a 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and routine labs to investigate other causes of irregular menses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism#H82649403\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Hirsutism with oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Total testosterone</strong> &ndash; In women with clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne, or male-pattern hair loss on exam), we suggest measuring serum total testosterone. Serum total testosterone is best assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy <span class=\"nowrap\">(LC-MS/MS),</span> an accurate and specific method. With <span class=\"nowrap\">LC-MS/MS,</span> the upper limit of normal for serum testosterone in women is in the 45 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> range (1.6 to 2.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L);</span> women with a serum testosterone &gt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> require evaluation for the most serious causes of hyperandrogenism (ovarian and adrenal androgen-secreting tumors) (see <a href=\"#H2549171686\" class=\"local\">'Severe hyperandrogenism/virilization'</a> below). The immunoassays that are available in most hospital laboratories are not suitable to accurately measure testosterone in women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism#H82649403\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Hirsutism with oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other androgens</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Free testosterone</strong> &ndash; We do <strong>not</strong> suggest the routine measurement of serum free testosterone. Some groups do recommend measuring free testosterone instead of or in addition to total testosterone because it may be the most sensitive test to establish the presence of hyperandrogenemia. However, commercially available free testosterone assays are currently unreliable. If measured, it should be done in a laboratory that measures it by equilibrium dialysis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Another option, although less good, is to order free testosterone from a laboratory that calculates it from total testosterone and <strong>sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)</strong> measurements using a formula demonstrated to give results that agree closely with those of equilibrium dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]; laboratories that use other formulae should not be used, since other formulae give spuriously high results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Measurement of SHBG is helpful in other ways. In women with PCOS, an abnormally low SHBG is a risk factor for increased biologically active testosterone and, hence, a more severe phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>DHEAS</strong> &ndash; We do <strong>not</strong> suggest the routine measurement of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) in women thought to have PCOS, because mildly elevated levels of DHEAS are unlikely to affect management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">However, we do suggest measuring DHEAS in severe hyperandrogenism because it can be extremely high in adrenocortical carcinoma. (See <a href=\"#H2549171686\" class=\"local\">'Severe hyperandrogenism/virilization'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Androstenedione</strong> &ndash; The role of serum androstenedione in the evaluation of PCOS <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hirsutism is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, its measurement in some populations with PCOS, for example, Icelandic women, may be important for documenting hyperandrogenism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Two studies have reported isolated elevations of serum androstenedione concentrations in women with PCOS, but the percent of women with this biochemical pattern is variable (20 of 86 [23 percent] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and 49 of 1128 [4.1 percent] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]). In the smaller study, serum androstenedione was negatively associated with insulin sensitivity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone</strong> &ndash; We suggest measuring a morning serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone in the early follicular phase in all women with possible PCOS to rule out nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. For women who have some spontaneous menstrual cycles, this should be done in the early follicular phase, while for those without cycles, it can be drawn on a random day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The clinical presentation of NCCAH is similar or identical to that of PCOS (hyperandrogenism, oligomenorrhea, and polycystic ovaries). NCCAH is less common than PCOS but should be ruled out because there are risks that offspring could be affected with the more severe classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65205\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65205 \">table 1</a>). It is particularly important to test women of Eastern European Jewish descent (who have a 1:27 prevalence) and women of Hispanic, Slavic, or Italian descent, in whom the prevalence is 1:40, 1:50, and 1:300 women, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Testing should include human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). In general, it is not necessary to measure luteinizing hormone (LH); an elevated LH:FSH ratio is not a criterion for the diagnosis of PCOS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-secondary-amenorrhea#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of secondary amenorrhea&quot;, section on 'Approach to evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the past, many clinicians measured LH and FSH and used an elevated LH:FSH ratio &ge;2 to 3:1 as evidence for the diagnosis of PCOS. However, the LH:FSH ratio was never a criterion for the diagnosis, and its use can be misleading (eg, if there has been a recent ovulation, LH will be suppressed and the ratio will be &le;2:1).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anti-m&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH) &ndash;</strong> Serum AMH concentrations are generally in the upper range of normal or elevated in women with PCOS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. At this time, AMH assays are limited by the absence of an international standard; AMH is not currently part of the laboratory evaluation of PCOS.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1560275034\"><span class=\"h4\">Already taking pharmacologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some women with hirsutism seek advice when they are already taking pharmacotherapy, usually estrogen-progestin oral contraceptives. Measuring serum androgens is generally not useful in this setting, because oral contraceptives suppress serum gonadotropins and ovarian androgens, most importantly, testosterone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-premenopausal-women-with-hirsutism#H620415983\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of premenopausal women with hirsutism&quot;, section on 'Women already taking pharmacologic therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Androgen measurements should also not be obtained when women are on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a>, as the interpretation of the result is confounded by the effects of these medications on androgen levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2549171686\"><span class=\"h4\">Severe hyperandrogenism/virilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with features of severe hyperandrogenism (virilization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hirsutism of recent onset that is rapidly progressive), we suggest measuring serum total testosterone, ideally using <span class=\"nowrap\">LC-MS/MS</span> in a laboratory that participates in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Hormone Standardization Program (HoSt), and serum DHEAS. These women usually have an androgen-secreting tumor (ovarian or adrenal) or ovarian hyperthecosis (although both are more common in post- than premenopausal women).

However, they typically also have symptoms and signs suggestive of cortisol excess, such as centripetal obesity, hypertension, purple striae, and proximal muscle weakness. Further evaluation is necessary in these cases to distinguish between the two disorders.

However, not all women with possible PCOS undergo ultrasound. If the patient has both oligomenorrhea and evidence of hyperandrogenism and causes other than PCOS have been ruled out, she meets criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS, and an ultrasound is <strong>not</strong> necessary. In women with hyperandrogenic symptoms and normal menstrual cycles, TVUS is often done to look for PCOM (see <a href=\"#H1833412531\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below). The transvaginal, rather than transabdominal, approach should be used whenever possible.</p><p>The ultrasound criteria for polycystic ovaries or PCOM have evolved since the first ultrasound description in 1986. It is important to note that follicle number and size, not cysts, are relevant to an ultrasound diagnosis.

(See <a href=\"#H93970491\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of PCOS is currently made using the Rotterdam criteria. Two out of three of the following are required to make the diagnosis: oligomenorrhea, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. However, not all experts agree that women with oligomenorrhea and polycystic ovaries, but not hyperandrogenism, should be considered to have PCOS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F86810\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86810 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1418519109\" class=\"local\">'Rotterdam criteria (preferred)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperandrogenism may be diagnosed by either clinical (acne, hirsutism, or male-pattern hair loss) or biochemical (elevated serum androgen concentration [usually total testosterone]) criteria. Therefore, a patient with oligomenorrhea and clinical evidence of hyperandrogenism, but normal serum androgen concentrations, is still considered to have PCOS. (See <a href=\"#H2659188992\" class=\"local\">'Women with hyperandrogenism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most expert groups suggest initial measurement of a total testosterone concentration in women who present with hirsutism. If there are concerns about a possible androgen-secreting tumor causing the hyperandrogenism (onset of hirsutism at a late age with rapid progression, signs of virilization such as deepening of the voice or clitoromegaly), we suggest measuring serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), as well as total testosterone to look for adrenal sources of hyperandrogenism. (See <a href=\"#H2659188992\" class=\"local\">'Women with hyperandrogenism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women who meet only one of the two criteria (oligoovulation and hyperandrogenism), transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is performed to look for the presence of polycystic ovaries (Rotterdam definition of polycystic ovaries described above). (See <a href=\"#H2233346013\" class=\"local\">'Transvaginal ultrasound'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who present with oligomenorrhea, other causes of irregular menses should be ruled out. Therefore, in addition to measuring serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to rule out pregnancy, testing should include serum prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to rule out hyperprolactinemia, thyroid disease, and ovarian insufficiency, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H3970071755\" class=\"local\">'Oligomenorrhea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the diagnosis of PCOS is made, cardiometabolic risk assessment should include measurement of blood pressure and body mass index (BMI), fasting lipid profile, and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). (See <a href=\"#H176328674\" class=\"local\">'Cardiometabolic risk assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with PCOS should be questioned about symptoms of depression, eating disorders, and sleep apnea as all are common in this population. (See <a href=\"#H176328926\" class=\"local\">'Depression and anxiety disorders'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4239800064\" class=\"local\">'Sleep apnea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with intermenstrual intervals &gt;35 days are oligoovulatory and may require weight loss <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ovulation induction agents to conceive. Fertility evaluation can be postponed until the patient is ready to pursue pregnancy. However, lifestyle changes such as weight loss and exercise should be instituted after diagnosis as lower BMI is associated with an improved likelihood of ovulation and conception. (See <a href=\"#H176329109\" class=\"local\">'Anovulatory infertility'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Randeva HS, Tan BK, Weickert MO, et al.
