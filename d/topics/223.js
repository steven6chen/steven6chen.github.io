Since that time, larger studies have described the clinical and laboratory features of acute and early HIV infection.</p><p>With the advent of more specific diagnostic testing, particularly HIV RNA detection, and more active drug regimens, early aggressive therapy during early HIV infection has become an option. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-and-interpretation-of-hiv-1-rna-quantitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques and interpretation of HIV-1 RNA quantitation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-antiretroviral-regimens-for-the-treatment-naive-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting antiretroviral regimens for the treatment-na&iuml;ve HIV-infected patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis and epidemiology of acute and early HIV will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of early HIV infection are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-and-early-hiv-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute and early HIV infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-and-early-hiv-infection-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute and early HIV infection: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H152751881\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different terms, including acute, recent, primary, and early HIV infection, have been used in the literature to refer to variable intervals following initial infection with the virus. In this topic, we use the term &quot;early HIV infection&quot; to refer to the approximate six-month period following HIV acquisition. We use the term &quot;acute HIV infection&quot; to refer to symptomatic early infection, as this reflects common usage in clinical care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV has several targets including dendritic cells, macrophages, and CD4+ T cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Target cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV-1 most often enters the host through the anogenital mucosa. The viral envelope protein, glycoprotein (GP)-120, binds to the CD4 molecule on dendritic cells. Interstitial dendritic cells are found in cervicovaginal epithelium as well as tonsillar and adenoidal tissue, which may serve as initial target cells in infection transmitted via genital-oral sex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Newly acquired HIV infection is more commonly due to transmission of macrophage tropic rather than T cell tropic viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Viral entry into these cells is mediated by different coreceptors. In order to enter macrophages, GP-120 must bind to the chemokine receptor CCR5 as well as CD4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Macrophage tropic viruses are designated as R5 in comparison to T cell tropic viruses, which are called X4, based upon the CXCR4 receptor on these cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients homozygous for a deletion in CCR5 are relatively resistant to R5 infection, but cases of X4 infection have rarely been reported in these individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p>HIV infected cells fuse with CD4+ T cells, leading to spread of the virus. HIV is detectable in regional lymph nodes within two days of mucosal exposure and in plasma within another three days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Once virus enters the blood, there is widespread dissemination to organs such as the brain, spleen, and lymph nodes.</p><p>The intestinal mucosa is also a primary target during initial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Massive CD4 T-cell depletion during acute infection has been demonstrated with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in rhesus macaques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Both studies documented that destruction occurred preferentially in CD4+ memory T cells, which may result from direct infection as well as through apoptosis. This can lead to an early and disproportionate loss of CD4+ T cells in the gastrointestinal compartment, compared to peripheral blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It has also been proposed that microbial translocation, due to changes in the gut mucosal barrier, may be the etiology of chronic immune activation in HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Viremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies in primates suggest viral penetration of mucosal epithelium, followed by infection of submucosal CD4+ T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages with subsequent spread to lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and ultimately, plasma. Viremia was documented between 5 to 30 days after experimental intravaginal HIV exposure.</p><p>HIV RNA levels rapidly increase from the earliest quantifiable measure to a peak level that usually coincides with seroconversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. However, a period of low-level viremia preceding ramp-up viremia, may be more common than originally thought. A study of serial samples from patients with confirmed early HIV infection was performed to determine if low levels of viremia were present in samples that were negative by prior quantitative PCR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. On retesting with a sensitive qualitative reverse transcriptase PCR assay with sensitivity of 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL,</span> 23 of 69 samples were subsequently positive. These specimens preceded the first sample with &gt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> by 9 to 25 days. Whether blood is infectious at this low level of concentration is not known.</p><p>The HIV DNA level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells provides an estimate of the cellular HIV reservoir, which is established soon after infection. In one study of 163 patients who did not start immediate antiretroviral therapy after diagnosis of acute infection, the HIV DNA level and initial CD4 cell count were found to be independent predictors of disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cellular immune response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the time of initial infection with HIV, patients have a large number of susceptible CD4+ T cells and no HIV-specific immune response. Viral replication is therefore rapid; plasma HIV RNA levels may climb to more than 10(7) <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> and p24 antigen levels may exceed 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span>.</p><p>Concomitant with the evolution of HIV specific immunity, primarily due to the emergence of virus-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, plasma RNA levels fall precipitously by 2 to 3 logs, and symptoms of the acute retroviral syndrome resolve. In the absence of antiretroviral therapy, plasma HIV RNA levels will stabilize at an individual's given &quot;set-point&quot; within six months of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The host factors, virus factors, and pharmacologic interventions, which determine this set point, are active issues for ongoing investigations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>A few HIV-positive individuals may, even in the absence of antiretroviral therapy, retain normal CD4 counts and low or undetectable plasma viremia. Those with persistent viral suppression are referred to as &quot;elite controllers.&quot; A large study from France demonstrated that this clinical phenotype was quite rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These individuals are distinguished from regular and rapid progressors by the persistence of HIV-specific T-helper cell proliferative responses. In one model, these proliferative responses allow for ongoing HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity and hence containment of plasma viremia. However, it is not clear whether these HIV immune responses directly cause, or alternatively, are the result of HIV control. Some research suggests that initiation of aggressive combination antiviral therapy during acute infection protects activated HIV-specific T helper cells from infection by HIV and thereby preserves the HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte response to virally infected cells &mdash; a situation analogous to the long-term nonprogressors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Studies of T cell responses in early HIV infection help to delineate how early therapy might improve clinical outcomes. In one study, patients with early HIV infection who were identified early in the course of their acute disease demonstrated a 10- to 20-fold increase in the proportion of highly activated (CD38+) and proliferating (Ki-67+) CD4 T cells that expressed CCR5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. CD4 T cells that produced interferon gamma in response to HIV antigens were readily detected in this patient subset. However, in patients with early HIV infection who presented later in their clinical course, antigen-specific CD4+ T cells could not be readily detected. This observation coincided with lower frequencies of activated and proliferating T cells, suggesting that apoptosis and cytopathic infection with HIV leads to their rapid decline. Regulatory T cells may also play a role in suppressing HIV-specific CD4 T cell responses in early infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Preservation of the immune response to HIV may also shorten the duration of symptoms associated with acute infection, prevent dissemination of virus to other organs, and establish a lower virologic &quot;set-point.&quot; Despite these potential benefits, eradication of virus seems unlikely with currently available agents, as studies consistently show that replication-competent HIV may be recovered even from patients with completely suppressed viral loads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In addition, patients with extremely low levels of virus after prolonged virologic suppressions still experience virologic rebound when treatment is stopped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>This concept was well-illustrated in a case report of an infant girl who was diagnosed with HIV infection at birth after her mother had primary seroconversion two weeks earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The baby was initiated on combination antiretroviral therapy within one week of birth. Antiretroviral therapy led to full suppression of HIV viremia, undetectable HIV-specific antibodies, and lack of detection of proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tonsillar tissue. In light of these findings and her strong HIV-specific T cell proliferative responses, antiviral therapy was stopped. Within one month, the CD4 count dropped from 3674 to <span class=\"nowrap\">2174/microL</span> and HIV plasma viremia rose to 46,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic susceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cohorts of individuals who are highly exposed (injection drug users or commercial sex workers) but who remain HIV-seronegative have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A nested case-control study of 266 HIV-seropositive patients and 532 seronegative controls was conducted to examine whether any of nine candidate host genes may play a role in susceptibility to HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Self-reported risk behaviors were analyzed from data collected at semi-annual visits. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (CCR-2, CCR5, MIP1A, and IL2) were significantly associated with HIV infection susceptibility in different genetic models.</p><p>The most extensively studied of these genetic factors is the C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), a major coreceptor for HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-and-early-hiv-infection-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. CCR5 (delta) 32 is an allele that contains a 32-base pair deletion and codes for a nonfunctional coreceptor. CCR5 (delta) 32 homozygotes (people who inherited the allele from both parents) are highly resistant to HIV infection. Patients who are heterozygous for the 32-base pair deletion can acquire HIV infection, but have a slower rate of progression.

Ninety-two percent of the men who seroconverted reported a clinical illness during the six-month interval compared to 40 percent of controls; the average duration of symptoms was 10 days longer in seroconverters and 87 percent sought medical attention. While the calculated lower limit of incidence of symptomatic acute HIV infection from this study is 53 percent based upon 40 percent of controls reporting an illness, the incidence is probably closer to the 92 percent given the distinctive nature of the syndrome reported by seroconverters.</p><p>In another study of seroconverters, identified through a surveillance program in which HIV testing was performed over six months, 20 of 23 (87 percent) individuals recalled symptoms consistent with the acute retroviral syndrome during the six-month interval containing their seroconversion.
