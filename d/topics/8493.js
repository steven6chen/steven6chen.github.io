Potassium is a substance found in certain foods. In people with hyperkalemia, the body holds on to too much potassium. People can get hyperkalemia if their kidneys are not working well, or if they take certain medicines.</p><p>Some of the medicines that can cause hyperkalemia include those listed below. Most of these medicines are used to treat high blood pressure or heart problems.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (called &quot;ACE inhibitors&quot;), such as enalapril, captopril, and lisinopril</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angiotensin receptor blockers (called &quot;ARBs&quot;), such as irbesartan (brand name: Avapro) and valsartan (brand name: Diovan)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aliskiren (brand name: Tekturna)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aldosterone antagonists, such as spironolactone (brand name: Aldactone)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain beta blockers, such as propranolol (brand name: Inderal) or labetalol (brand name: Normodyne)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NSAIDs &ndash; You can buy certain kinds of NSAIDs at the pharmacy without a prescription. NSAIDs are a large group of medicines that includes ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (sample brand name: Aleve). But for other kinds, such as celecoxib (brand name: Celebrex), you will need a prescription.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Digoxin (brand name: Lanoxin)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8473397\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of hyperkalemia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom of hyperkalemia is a feeling of weakness in the muscles. The weakness usually starts in the legs and then spreads to the middle of the body and the arms. Hyperkalemia can also cause the heart to beat too slowly or too quickly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8473412\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for hyperkalemia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse suspects you have hyperkalemia, he or she will do a blood test to measure the level of potassium in your blood. You might also have a test called an electrocardiogram or &quot;ECG.&quot; An ECG is a test that records the electrical activity of the heart.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8473427\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hyperkalemia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the time, doctors treat hyperkalemia by recommending a change in diet or medicines.</p><p>To treat your hyperkalemia, you will need to eat a diet that has very little potassium. This means you will need to eat more low-potassium foods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F81516\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81516 \">table 1</a>) and fewer high-potassium foods (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58250\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58250 \">table 2</a>). Your doctor can refer you to a dietitian (food expert) who can help you plan meals that are low in potassium.</p><p>If your hyperkalemia was caused by one of your medicines, your doctor might also decide to lower the dose of the medicine or to switch you to a medicine that is less likely to cause hyperkalemia.</p><p>If you have severe hyperkalemia, you might need treatment with medicines given through a thin tube that goes into a vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot; Often, the IV goes in a vein in your arm. But sometimes, the IV needs to go through a large vein in your chest or groin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8473442\"><span class=\"h1\">Can hyperkalemia be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have kidney disease, you can reduce your chances of getting hyperkalemia by eating a low potassium diet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8473457\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=side-effects-from-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Side effects from medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-potassium-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low-potassium diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lichen-planus-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lichen planus (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-potassium-diet-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Low-potassium diet (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
