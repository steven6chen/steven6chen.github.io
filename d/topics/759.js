It is called a sequence because the pattern of congenital anomalies results from a single defect that can be produced by a variety of different etiologies. In contrast, a syndrome refers to a pattern of congenital anomalies that are known, or at least assumed, to result from only a single etiology.</p><p>Heterogeneity in clinical manifestations, etiology, pathogenesis, and recurrence risk of amniotic band-associated anomalies has contributed to confusion regarding nomenclature. Historically, diverse terms have been used to describe these anomalies, including amniotic band sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], amniotic band syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], amniotic band disruption complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], limb body wall complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], body wall complex with limb defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], amniotic deformity, adhesion, and mutilation (ADAM) sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], etc. We consider amniotic band sequence (ABS) the most appropriate term since the pattern of anomalies is secondary to disruption of heterogeneous etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, this nomenclature remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/6,11,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The estimated incidence of ABS ranges from 1:1200 to 1:15,000 in live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and 1:70 in stillbirths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It affects both sexes equally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of both amniotic bands and ABS are not firmly established.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Early amniotic rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One hypothesis is that amniotic bands are related to rupture of the amnion. In these cases, loose strands of amnion are believed to adhere to and then entangle the <span class=\"nowrap\">embryo/fetus</span> or germ disc, resulting in mechanical or vascular disruption of otherwise normal developing structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/1-4,9,10,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4,9,10,15-17</a>]. As an example, amniotic bands that adhere to the developing limb, cranium, or body wall can compromise its blood supply leading to partial amputation. Other anomalies in ABS, such as lung hypoplasia, clubfoot, and hand deformities, have been related to oligohydramnios following amnion rupture.</p><p>The cause of amnion rupture is uncertain in most cases, but associations with abdominal trauma during pregnancy and maternal or fetal diseases have been reported in some cases. &quot;Pseudoamniotic band syndrome&quot; has been used to describe cases due to iatrogenic rupture of the amnion from an invasive procedure (eg, fetoscopy, septostomy, amniocentesis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular disruption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amniotic bands not causally related to early amnion rupture are thought to be a secondary phenomena after a primary disruptive event. As an example, disruption of fetal blood flow might lead to several sequelae, including generation of amniotic bands and internal and external fetal malformations. Other evidence supporting a vascular etiology is the increased prevalence of internal visceral anomalies and other anomalies not readily explicable by the ABS and the frequent finding of disruptive defects in fetuses with a histologically normal intact amniotic lining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The presence of multiple or severe defects in some ABS cases suggests the occurrence of more than one disruptive factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/13,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic mutation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small subset of ABS cases have malformations that cannot be explained by disruption by external forces alone. In these cases, a genetic basis for the malformation, and thus the possibility of an increased risk of recurrence, should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/4,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14</a>]. Mutations in the human homologue of the mouse gene Ds &quot;disorganization gene&quot; have been proposed as one mechanism for the combination of <span class=\"nowrap\">constriction/duplication</span> abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Almost all cases of ABS in twins have been in monozygotic twins, which also suggests an etiology intrinsic to the fetus.</p><p>Other intrinsic defects and environmental etiologies should also be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Constriction rings and limb and digital amputation are common findings in ABS, but the clinical spectrum is highly variable. A single mild defect may be present or the fetus may be severely deformed, with multiple anomalies affecting cranium, spine, limbs, and trunk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Constriction rings are congenital depressions of tissue that encircle a portion of the body. In ABS, multiple constriction rings may be present that involve multiple digits and limbs. Fibrous bands of amnion can be found deep inside most of the constriction rings and may contribute to compromise of the vascular supply, as well as bone and nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/17,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,26</a>]. If constriction results in amputation, the amputated body part is often resorbed, and thus will not be found at delivery.</p><p>Anomalies include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Craniofacial abnormalities &mdash; eg, encephalocele, exencephaly, clefts, which are often in unusual locations; anencephaly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body wall defects (especially if not in the midline), abdominal or thoracic contents may herniate through a body wall defect and into the amniotic cavity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limb defects &mdash; constriction rings, amputation, syndactyly, clubfoot, hand deformities, lymphedema distal to a constriction ring.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visceral defects &mdash; eg, lung hypoplasia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other &mdash; Autotransplanted tissue on skin tags, spinal defects, scoliosis, ambiguous genitalia, short umbilical cord due to restricted motion of the fetus </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H440578830\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ABS appears to be associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, and stillbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/2,3,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,28</a>]. The postnatal prognosis in ABS depends on the severity of the anomalies, especially involvement of internal organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The spectrum varies from mild abnormalities with an excellent prognosis to severe anomalies that are lethal.</p><p>Usually there is no progression in severity following birth, with the exception of cases with marked vascular occlusion due to constrictive bands. In early infancy, some of these cases might present with progressive edema distal to the constriction rings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of ABS is based upon the presence of characteristic structural findings on prenatal ultrasound or postnatal physical examination of the affected individual (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56307\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56307 \">image 1</a>). The diagnosis should be suspected when limb amputations or atypical body wall or craniofacial defects are present, or when bands of amnion are seen crossing the gestational sac and adherent to the fetus, restricting its movement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69162%7EOBGYN%2F70926%7EOBGYN%2F63863\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69162 graphicRef70926 graphicRef63863 \">image 2A-C</a>). The diagnosis of ABS should not be based on visualization of amniotic abnormalities alone in the absence of fetal structural abnormalities or restricted movement. These amniotic variants may be seen in normal pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>In most cases of prenatally detected ABS, however, the bands of amnion are not visualized sonographically, and only the fetal structural abnormalities are seen. Antenatal magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>If ABS is suspected postnatally, immediate investigation of the fresh fetal membranes and placenta is important. Amniotic strands can be visualized easily by immersion of fresh membranes and placenta into a tub of water. Care should be taken if there is frayed amnion or complete or partial separation of amnion from the chorion, so as not to create the appearance of amniotic bands postpartum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amniotic sheets typically arise when chorioamniotic membranes wrap around uterine synechiae (intrauterine adhesions), thus they have two layers of amnion and two layers of chorion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. They commonly have a widened base along the uterine wall, and may extend to the contralateral uterine wall. </p><p>Amniotic sheets occur in about 0.5 percent of pregnancies and are not associated with fetal anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. They are usually considered to be an incidental benign finding, although three series observed an increase in some types of obstetric morbidity (eg, premature rupture of membranes, placental abruption, malpresentation) in pregnancies with amniotic sheets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>] and two reports described a total of four stillbirths, three of the four were attributed to cord accidents and one was unexplained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Additional studies are needed to determine whether there is a true association between amniotic sheets and adverse pregnancy outcome.</p><p>Heterogeneity in the clinical manifestations and etiology of ABS makes diagnosis particularly challenging. The differential diagnosis of a band of tissue seen in or impinging on the gestational sac includes uterine synechia, uterine septum, and residual twin gestational sac. These are typically relatively easy to diagnose, and are not associated with fetal anomalies of the type that occur in ABS. Fibrin strands that occur after in utero bleeding are usually obvious due to clinical history of bleeding or recent invasive procedure. These strands may be adherent to the fetus, but should change in appearance over time, and are not associated with fetal anomalies. Unfused amnion or chorioamniotic separation are typically diagnosed when a large section of unfused amnion is seen. If this persists, it may be associated with club foot, but the other anomalies of ABS do not occur. Acquired limb ischemia is a rare complication of monochorionic twin pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The etiology is unclear, but, in some cases, it may be related to interventions for twin-twin transfusion syndrome.</p><p>As limb and digital amputation are common findings in ABS, it is of particular importance to consider other etiologies of limb reduction defects, such as genetic and teratogenic causes. In general, limb reduction defects affecting the middle bone of multiple limbs are highly likely to be genetic, especially if they are symmetrical. For accurate assessment of the recurrence risk, it is of particular importance to not miss genetic diseases that may mimic ABS (eg, Adams-Oliver Syndrome, which has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY COUNSELING AND MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prenatal and intrapartum management of suspected ABS depends on the type and extent of malformations. All patients should receive information about the fetal abnormalities that have been detected, the possibility of additional undetected abnormalities, prognosis, and the option of pregnancy termination. If pregnancy termination is performed, it is useful to try to deliver an intact abortus that can be examined to confirm the diagnosis.</p><p>All families with infants born with suspected ABS should be referred to genetics services for evaluation, which will include a detailed family history, pregnancy history, assessment of teratogen exposure, and physical examination. If the diagnosis of ABS is uncertain, genetic studies (eg, chromosomal microarray) are often indicated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H440578818\"><span class=\"h2\">In utero</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been case reports of in utero surgical lysis of constriction rings, purportedly leading to improved blood flow and prevention of amputation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-44</a>]. The efficacy of this approach is unproven and selection criteria for candidates for in utero intervention have not been defined. One group hypothesized that appropriate potential candidates for this investigational procedure would be fetuses with normal Doppler flow above the constriction and abnormal, but present, flow below the constriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Between 1965 and 2013, 14 cases of fetoscopic laser transection of amniotic bands around a limb have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Seven infants had an acceptable functional outcome, but some needed additional corrective postnatal surgical procedures. One fetus died in utero. In three cases, intraoperative intra-amniotic bleeding and uterine wall bleeding prevented completion of fetoscopic surgery, but in two of these cases the bands were released under ultrasound guidance. Eight cases were complicated by preterm premature rupture of membranes, which occurred within 24 hours of the intervention in two cases, at four days in one case, and 4 to 13 weeks after the intervention in the remainder. Ten pregnancies delivered preterm. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H440578824\"><span class=\"h2\">Postnatal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In early infancy, infants with marked vascular occlusion due to constrictive bands might develop progressive edema distal to the constriction rings, which can be treated by surgical release. Rarely, necrosis distal to vascular occlusion might necessitate immediate surgical release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Postnatal treatment options include surgical intervention to enhance function or for cosmetic purposes, and prosthesis and physiotherapy for individuals with limb defects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">RECURRENCE RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrence risk is estimated based upon family history, patient history, and thorough physical examination. Most ABS is sporadic with low recurrence risk; however, a few familial cases have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/2,47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,47-49</a>]. Genetic counseling to discuss recurrence risk is recommended if a genetic disease associated with amniotic bands is suspected (eg, epidermolysis bullosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], or connective tissue disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniotic-band-sequence/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amniotic band sequence refers to a highly variable spectrum of congenital anomalies that occur in association with amniotic bands.
