They reduce redness, itching, and rash.</p><p>They come in many different forms, including creams, ointments, gels, lotions, shampoos, sprays, and foams. They also come in different strengths. Milder ones can often be bought without a prescription (&quot;over-the-counter&quot;) from pharmacies. Stronger ones are available with a doctor's prescription. The right strength and form for you depends on what skin problem you have and which parts of your body are affected.</p><p>Steroid medicines are also used as pills, shots, inhalers, and nose sprays for other medical conditions. Those types of corticosteroids are discussed separately.

There are others, too.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3529198592\"><span class=\"h1\">What are topical corticosteroids used for?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>They are used to treat many different skin conditions including eczema, psoriasis, rash, and minor irritation from insect bites.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2395693967\"><span class=\"h1\">How do topical corticosteroids work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical corticosteroids work by reducing inflammation in the skin. Inflammation means redness, swelling, and irritation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3430060624\"><span class=\"h1\">What is the correct way to use a corticosteroid cream or ointment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following are general instructions for using creams and ointments:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First wash the affected skin carefully, rinse away soap, and carefully pat dry. Do not rub the skin dry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To open the tube the first time, you might need to use the point on the cap to break the seal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Squeeze out a small amount that is just enough to thinly cover the affected skin. A pea-sized amount is enough for minor skin irritation or insect bite.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply the cream or ointment evenly to the affected skin, in a thin layer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gently massage the cream or ointment until it disappears.</p><p/><p>If you have large area of affected skin, or several different areas, your doctor or nurse will tell you how much cream or ointment to use.</p><p>Using the cream or ointment once a day is usually enough. Do not use more often unless your doctor or nurse tells you to. Do not use topical corticosteroids on your face, genitals, anus, or beneath your breasts unless your doctor or nurse tells you to. Also, do not use them on any raw or broken skin, or on skin that rubs against other skin. Do not cover the area with dressings such as bandages or gauze.</p><p>The most important thing to remember is to use a <strong>small amount</strong> and apply it in a <strong>thin layer</strong>. This prevents too much of the medicine from being absorbed in your body, and lowers the chance of side effects.</p><p>Be sure to carefully follow the instructions your doctor or nurse gives you. You should also read the information that comes with your medicine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H522210627\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the side effects of topical steroids?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common side effect is a mild burning or stinging feeling when you first apply the medicine. This usually goes away after the first few uses.</p><p>Topical corticosteroids do not usually have serious side effects. If you use them for a long time or at high doses, side effects can include thin or red skin or acne in the areas that were treated. Thinning of the skin can make it easier for the skin to break, bruise, or stretch. Older people, young children, babies, and people with fragile skin are more likely to have problems if they use topical corticosteroids.</p><p>If you need to use topical corticosteroids for more than a few weeks, your doctor might have you take regular breaks from the medicine. This can help lower the risk of side effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4123937534\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I know about topical steroids?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As your skin problem gets better, your doctor might have you decrease your topical corticosteroid treatments gradually, instead of stopping all at once. This makes it less likely that your skin problem will come back once you are no longer using the medicine.</p><p>If you are pregnant or want to get pregnant, you might be able to use a small amount of topical corticosteroid occasionally. But it's important to talk to your doctor or nurse first, or if you have any questions.</p><p>For more detailed information about your medicines, ask your doctor or nurse for information from Lexicomp available through UpToDate. Also, read the information that comes with your medicine. These leaflets explain how to use and store your medicines. They also list more possible side effects and warn you if your medicines should not be taken with certain other medicines or foods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2921665480\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dermatitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=eczema-atopic-dermatitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Eczema (atopic dermatitis) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriasis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Psoriasis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhoids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hemorrhoids (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atopic-dermatitis-eczema-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Atopic dermatitis (eczema) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoriasis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Psoriasis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhoids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hemorrhoids (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
