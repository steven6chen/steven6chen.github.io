These acids are metabolized to neutral products (such as glucose) and to CO2 and water. Normally, the generation and utilization rates of these organic acids are equal so that their steady state concentration in the extracellular fluid is relatively low and stable. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 50 to 100 meq of nonvolatile acid is produced each day (mostly sulfuric acid derived from the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids in the diet). </p><p/><p>Acid-base balance is maintained by normal pulmonary excretion of carbon dioxide, metabolic utilization of organic acids, and renal excretion of nonvolatile acids.</p><p>Renal excretion of acid is achieved by combining hydrogen ions with either urinary buffers to form titratable acid, such as phosphate (HPO4- &#160;+ &#160;H+ &#160;&rarr; &#160;H2PO4-), urate, and creatinine, or with ammonia to form ammonium (NH3 &#160;+ &#160;H+ &#160;&rarr; &#160;NH4+) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Mixed acid-base disorders can be suspected from the patient's history, from a lesser- or greater-than-expected compensatory respiratory or renal response, and from analysis of the serum electrolytes and anion gap. As an example, a patient with severe vomiting would be expected to develop a metabolic alkalosis due to the loss of acidic gastric fluid. If, however, the patient also developed hypovolemic shock from the fluid loss, the ensuing lactic acidosis would lower the elevated serum HCO3 possibly to below normal values, resulting in acidemia. (See <a href=\"#H94198601\" class=\"local\">'Mixed acid-base disorders'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12584047\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPENSATORY RESPIRATORY AND RENAL RESPONSES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H141686354\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation described above shows that the pH is determined by the ratio of the serum bicarbonate (HCO3) concentration and the PCO2, not by the value of either one alone. Each of the simple acid-base disorders is associated with a compensatory respiratory or renal response that limits the change in ratio and therefore in pH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79833\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79833 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a metabolic acid-base disorder reduces the serum HCO3 (metabolic acidosis) or increases the HCO3 (metabolic alkalosis), there should be an appropriate degree of respiratory compensation moving the PCO2 in the <strong>same direction</strong> as the serum HCO3 (falling in metabolic acidosis and rising in metabolic alkalosis). The respiratory compensation mitigates the change in the ratio of the serum HCO3 to PCO2 and therefore in the pH. Respiratory compensation in metabolic acidosis or alkalosis is a rapid response. With metabolic acidosis, for example, the response begins within 30 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and is complete within 12 to 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a respiratory acid-base disorder causes the PCO2 to increase (respiratory acidosis) or decrease (respiratory alkalosis), compensation occurs in two phases. There is an immediate, small change in serum HCO3 (in the same direction as the PCO2 change), which is due to whole body buffering mechanisms. If the respiratory disorder persists for more than minutes to hours, the kidneys respond by producing larger changes in serum HCO3 (again, in the <strong>same direction</strong> as the PCO2). These HCO3 changes mitigate the change in pH. Renal compensations are mediated by increased hydrogen ion secretion (which raises the serum HCO3 concentration) in respiratory acidosis and decreased hydrogen ion secretion and urinary HCO3 loss in respiratory alkalosis. The renal compensation takes three to five days for completion. As a result, the expected findings are very different in acute (whole body buffering without significant renal compensation) and chronic (full renal compensation) respiratory acid-base disorders. (See <a href=\"#H12584082\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory acid-base disorders'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The compensatory renal and respiratory responses are thought to be mediated, at least in part, by parallel pH changes within sensory and regulatory cells including renal tubule cells and cells in the respiratory center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The magnitude of the compensatory response is proportional to the severity of the primary acid-base disturbance. </p><p>It follows from the above discussion that a high HCO3 concentration may be due to metabolic alkalosis or compensation for chronic respiratory acidosis. Conversely, a low HCO3 may be due to metabolic acidosis or compensation for chronic respiratory alkalosis. Analogous issues apply to a high or low PCO2. At least two of the three variables in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (pH, HCO3, PCO2) must be measured to assess an acid-base disorder (and if two are measured, the third can be deduced).</p><p>The expected degree of compensation for each acid-base disorder has been determined empirically by observations in humans with either spontaneous or experimentally induced simple acid-base disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79833\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79833 \">figure 1</a>). The degree of compensation is usually defined by the decrease or increase in arterial PCO2 from its normal range (in metabolic acid-base disorders) or the decrease or increase in serum HCO3 from its normal range (in respiratory acid-base disorders). This approach presumes that the patient had normal values prior to the onset of the acid-base disorder. Thus, in the absence of known baseline values, there is the potential for error if the patient's acid-base status was not normal at the onset of the disorder. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351038132\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolic acid-base disorders</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12584056\"><span class=\"h3\">Metabolic acidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory compensation for metabolic acidosis causes the arterial PCO2 to fall approximately 1.2 mmHg (0.16 kPa) for every 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> reduction in the serum HCO3 concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>].

There is no lag in respiratory compensation when metabolic acidosis develops slowly (eg, 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> fall in serum HCO3 over 15 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. An inability to generate the expected respiratory response is usually indicative of significant underlying respiratory or neurologic disease, but can also occur at the onset of acute metabolic acidosis before there has been adequate time for respiratory compensation to fully develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/simple-and-mixed-acid-base-disorders/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Several other predictive relationships have been proposed to determine the appropriate respiratory compensation to metabolic acidosis.

Because there are no data on comparative accuracy (see <a href=\"#H351037906\" class=\"local\">'Case 2'</a> below), the reader may use the relationship rule he or she finds easiest to remember and implement.</p><p>There is a limit to the maximum respiratory compensation that can be attained. With severe metabolic acidosis (eg, serum HCO3 concentration less than 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L),</span> the PCO2 can fall no lower than 8 to 12 mmHg (1.1 to 1.6 kPa). In addition, the duration that such compensation can be maintained is limited due to respiratory muscle fatigue.</p><p>In addition to assessing the respiratory compensation, another component in the evaluation of patients with metabolic acidosis is calculation of the serum anion gap to determine whether it is normal or elevated. Metabolic acidosis may be of the high anion gap type, normal anion gap type (hyperchloremic), or combined normal and elevated anion gap acidosis. As an example, with severe diarrhea, loss of bicarbonate in the stool typically generates a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, but the resulting hypovolemia can also lead to lactic acidosis and renal dysfunction with a high anion gap acidosis. With high anion gap metabolic acidosis, comparing the change in anion gap (or the delta anion gap) with the change in bicarbonate (or the delta bicarbonate) may be helpful.

These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-metabolic-acidosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with metabolic acidosis&quot;, section on 'Physiologic interpretation of the serum anion gap'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-delta-anion-gap-delta-hco3-ratio-in-patients-with-a-high-anion-gap-metabolic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The delta anion gap/delta HCO3 ratio in patients with a high anion gap metabolic acidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A definitive diagnosis of acid-base disorders requires measurement of the arterial pH and PCO2 as well as the serum chemistries to identify the underlying disorder and to determine whether a mixed acid-base disorder exists. However, measurement of arterial pH is not always required. When the history and serum electrolytes clearly point toward a particular diagnosis, a presumptive diagnosis can be made. As an example, arterial blood gas analysis might not be required in a previously healthy patient with a recent history of severe diarrhea who has a low serum bicarbonate, hypokalemia, and a normal anion gap. This patient can be assumed to have a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis because there is no reason to suspect chronic respiratory alkalosis (a disorder in which a low serum bicarbonate develops as a compensatory response).</p><p>Measurement of peripheral venous pH and PCO2 is an alternative diagnostic procedure that is a less invasive and more convenient approach than arterial measurements. However, venous measurements have some important limitations. As a result, arterial measurements are preferred. If venous measurements are used for serial monitoring, periodic correlation with arterial measurements should be performed. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H102629685\" class=\"local\">'Normal values according to site of sampling'</a> above.) </p><p>We suggest the following three-step approach in most patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 1: Establish the primary diagnosis:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a low serum HCO3 and a low arterial pH; the serum anion gap may be increased or normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by an elevated serum HCO3 and an elevated arterial pH.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Respiratory acidosis is characterized by an elevated arterial PCO2 and a low arterial pH.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Respiratory alkalosis is characterized by low arterial PCO2 and an elevated arterial pH.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>With the exception of chronic respiratory alkalosis and mild to moderate respiratory acidosis (see <a href=\"#H94198601\" class=\"local\">'Mixed acid-base disorders'</a> below), compensatory responses do not usually return the arterial pH to normal. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Thus, a normal arterial pH in the presence of substantial changes in both serum HCO3 and arterial PCO2 is usually indicative of a <strong>mixed</strong> acid-base disorder (which could include an iatrogenic acute respiratory alkalosis if discomfort from the arterial puncture causes the patient to hyperventilate). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 2: Assess the degree of compensation as defined above for the individual disorders. A substantially reduced or excessive level of compensation is indicative of a <strong>mixed</strong> acid-base disorder. (See <a href=\"#H12584047\" class=\"local\">'Compensatory respiratory and renal responses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The compensatory response must be correlated with the history. This is particularly true in respiratory acid-base disorders since the renal compensation occurs over three to five days. Thus, the expected level of compensation is smaller with acute respiratory disorders compared with chronic respiratory disorders. As noted above, the normal compensatory response to respiratory acidosis is an increase in the serum HCO3 concentration by about 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> for every 10 mmHg (1.3 kPa) elevation in the PCO2 acutely and about 3.5 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> for every 10 mmHg (1.3 kPa) elevation in the PCO2 if the underlying respiratory problem persists for three to five days or more. (See <a href=\"#H12584090\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory acidosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Step 3: Determine whether or not the anion gap is elevated. This is especially important for patients with metabolic acidosis. If the anion gap is increased, then analyze the ratio of the increase in anion gap to the decrease in the HCO3 concentration. This is called the delta anion <span class=\"nowrap\">gap/delta</span> HCO3 ratio. Interpretation of the anion gap and the delta anion <span class=\"nowrap\">gap/delta</span> HCO3 ratio are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-metabolic-acidosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with metabolic acidosis&quot;, section on 'Physiologic interpretation of the serum anion gap'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-delta-anion-gap-delta-hco3-ratio-in-patients-with-a-high-anion-gap-metabolic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The delta anion gap/delta HCO3 ratio in patients with a high anion gap metabolic acidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>The final step is to establish the clinical diagnosis. Once the acid-base disorder, or disorders, is identified, the underlying cause or causes of each disorder should be determined and addressed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H377752461\"><span class=\"h3\">Case 1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A patient with an unknown past history presents with respiratory distress. Arterial blood shows a pH of 7.32, PCO2 of 70 mmHg (9.3 kPa), and HCO3 of 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span>. The HCO3 is approximately 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> above the normal range, and the PCO2 is approximately 30 mmHg above the normal range. These values are compatible with a diagnosis of a simple (fully compensated) chronic respiratory acidosis. However, the results are also compatible with a mixed acid-base disorder. As an example, an acute respiratory acidosis causing a rise in PCO2 to 70 mmHg (9.3 kPa) should increase the serum HCO3 by about 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> to about 27 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span>. If, before the onset of respiratory acidosis, vomiting (a metabolic alkalosis) had increased the serum bicarbonate by 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L,</span> the combined effects of acute respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis (a mixed acid-base disorder) would result in identical laboratory findings. The history usually helps to distinguish among these possibilities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351037906\"><span class=\"h3\">Case 2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A patient presents with diarrhea. Arterial blood shows a pH of 7.24, PCO2 of 24 mmHg (3.2 kPa), and HCO3 or 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span>. The low pH indicates acidemia, and the low serum HCO3 concentration indicates metabolic acidosis. The serum HCO3 concentration of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> is approximately 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> below normal. This should stimulate respiratory compensation and a 17 mmHg (2.3 kPa) fall in the PCO2 (14 &#160;x &#160;1.2 &#160;= &#160;17) from 40 to 23 mmHg (5.3 to 3.1 kPa). These results are consistent with a simple metabolic acidosis. The other estimation equations for the degree of compensation cited above give similar results. Winters' equation predicts a PCO2 of 23 mmHg (1.5 x 10 +8 &plusmn; 2); the &quot;HCO3 + 15&quot; rule predicts a PCO2 of 25 mmHg (3.3 kPa). In addition, the PCO2 is the same as the decimal digits of the arterial pH. (See <a href=\"#H12584056\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic acidosis'</a> above.)</p><p>A PCO2 significantly higher than the expected value would be consistent with a concurrent respiratory acidosis, as might occur, for example, if the patient were obtunded and had respiratory center depression. If, on the other hand, the PCO2 were lower than 20 mmHg (2.7 kPa), then a concurrent respiratory alkalosis would be present. The combination of metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis is often seen with salicylate intoxication or septic shock. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salicylate-aspirin-poisoning-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salicylate (aspirin) poisoning in adults&quot;, section on 'Acid-base abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94198601\"><span class=\"h2\">Mixed acid-base disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients have two, three, or more relatively independent acid-base disorders. These mixed disorders include combinations of metabolic disorders (eg, vomiting-induced metabolic alkalosis plus hypovolemia-induced lactic acidosis), mixed metabolic and respiratory disorders (eg, metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis in salicylate intoxication), and more complex combinations.</p><p>As discussed in the preceding section, the evaluation of patients with acid-base disorders initially requires identification of the major disorder, and then determination of whether or not the degree of compensation is appropriate. If the compensation is <strong>not</strong> appropriate, then this is indicative of a second acid-base disorder (ie, a mixed acid-base disorder is present). The following examples are illustrative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If metabolic acidosis is the primary disorder, an arterial PCO2 substantially higher than the expected compensatory response defines the mixed disorder of metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis, while an arterial PCO2 substantially lower than expected defines the mixed disorder of metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis (which could be produced by acute hyperventilation due to the discomfort of obtaining the blood sample).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If respiratory acidosis is the major disorder, then the serum HCO3 should be appropriately increased. If the serum HCO3 is not as high as expected, then metabolic acidosis also exists and the arterial pH may be substantially reduced. By contrast, if the serum HCO3 is higher than expected, then metabolic alkalosis complicates the respiratory acidosis and the arterial pH may be inappropriately &quot;normal.&quot;</p><p/><p>In patients with a high anion gap metabolic acidosis, a diagnosis of a mixed metabolic acidosis and a metabolic alkalosis is generally suggested by calculation and interpretation of the delta anion gap and the delta HCO3. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-delta-anion-gap-delta-hco3-ratio-in-patients-with-a-high-anion-gap-metabolic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The delta anion gap/delta HCO3 ratio in patients with a high anion gap metabolic acidosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12584179\"><span class=\"h3\">Case 3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determining the appropriate compensatory response may be more difficult with respiratory acid-base disorders because compensatory responses differ in acute and chronic disturbances. Consider the following arterial blood values: pH 7.27, PCO2 70 mmHg (9.3 kPa), and HCO3 31 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span>. The low pH and hypercapnia indicate that the patient has respiratory acidosis. If this is acute hypercapnia, then the 30 mmHg (4 kPa) rise in PCO2 should increase the serum HCO3 concentration by about 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> (to about 27 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L)</span>. If this is chronic hypercapnia, the serum HCO3 should increase by about 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> (to about 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L)</span>. The observed value of 31 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> is between these expected levels and could have multiple explanations, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic respiratory acidosis with a superimposed metabolic acidosis that has reduced the serum HCO3 from 35 to 31 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span>. This might occur in a patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who developed diarrhea due to viral gastroenteritis or lactic acidosis from sepsis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute respiratory acidosis with a superimposed metabolic alkalosis that has increased the HCO3 from 27 to 31 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span>. This could occur in a patient with respiratory depression due to a sedating drug who also developed vomiting or was taking diuretics. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute respiratory acidosis superimposed on mild chronic respiratory acidosis. Suppose, for example, that a patient has chronic respiratory acidosis with a PCO2 of 55 mmHg (7.3 kPa) and an appropriate serum HCO3 of 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span>. The patient then develops pneumonia, which acutely increases the PCO2 to 70 mmHg (9.3 kPa). The serum HCO3 would rise further to about 31 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute respiratory acidosis that is evolving into a chronic disorder (between one and three days).</p><p/><p>Thus, the correct diagnosis in a primary respiratory acid-base disorder can be established only when correlated with the clinical history and physical examination. This is true even when the arterial blood values appear to represent a simple disorder. If the serum HCO3 concentration had been 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> in this example, the findings would have been compatible with an uncomplicated chronic respiratory acidosis. However, similar findings could have been induced by acute respiratory acidosis plus metabolic alkalosis. The history usually helps to distinguish among the possibilities. (See <a href=\"#H12584082\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory acid-base disorders'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365263262\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acid-base status is usually assessed by measuring the components of the bicarbonate-carbon dioxide buffer system in blood. When blood gas analysis is carried out, the partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2) and the pH are each measured using electrodes, and the bicarbonate (HCO3) concentration is calculated with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. When the HCO3 is measured in venous blood, it is usually measured directly as &quot;total CO2&quot; with an ion-selective electrode. The directly measured venous &quot;total CO2&quot; is generally about 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> greater than the simultaneously calculated arterial HCO3. (See <a href=\"#H12584019\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The range of normal values for acid-base parameters is different for arterial and venous samples and also varies among laboratories (see <a href=\"#H102629685\" class=\"local\">'Normal values according to site of sampling'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For an arterial sample, the normal range for pH is 7.36 to 7.44; for bicarbonate (HCO3) concentration, 21 to 27 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L;</span> and for PCO2, 36 to 44 mmHg (4.9 to 5.9 kPa).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For a peripheral venous sample, the range for pH is approximately 0.02 to 0.04 pH units lower than in arterial blood; for HCO3 concentration, approximately 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> higher; and for PCO2, approximately 3 to 8 mmHg (0.4 to 1.1 kPa) higher.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For a central venous sample, the range for pH is usually 0.03 to 0.05 pH units lower than in arterial blood, and the PCO2 is 4 to 5 mmHg (0.5 to 0.7 kPa) higher, with little or no increase in serum HCO3.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each simple acid-base disorder is normally associated with a compensatory response that reduces the change in the <span class=\"nowrap\">HCO3/PCO2</span> ratio and therefore in pH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79833\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79833 \">figure 1</a>).
