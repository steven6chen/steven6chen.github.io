Children with HF often have increased caloric needs due to an increased metabolic demand. In addition, patients with HF often tire with feeding and their intake may be limited. Some children may need a daily intake &gt;120 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> for optimal growth. In order to provide adequate caloric intake, intermittent or continuous nasogastric or gastrostomy tube feeds may be required. In addition, salt and fluid restriction is recommended in children with severe HF to reduce volume overload.

Nearly one-third of children with cardiomyopathy manifest growth failure during the course of their illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-children-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A retrospective analysis of 165 children with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy found that nutritional status positively and independently correlated with survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-children-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H55671093\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise and physical activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Promoting healthy and safe physical activity in patients with HF is an important part of management. The challenge is to balance encouraging routine daily physical activity and limiting inactivity while minimizing any potential risks from exercise. Recommendations should be tailored for each individual based on his or her specific diagnosis and a comprehensive assessment of the child's exercise capacity. This should generally include formal cardiopulmonary exercise testing if feasible (ie, if the child is old enough to cooperate, typically beginning around age6 or 7 years). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-aerobic-exercise-testing-in-children-and-adolescents#H304898414\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of aerobic exercise testing in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Limitations in young children'</a>.)</p><p>Physical activity and exercise in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are discussed in greater detail separately.

Management begins with a thorough assessment of the underlying cause of HF. The causes of pediatric HF can be divided into pathophysiologic categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79989\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79989 \">table 1</a>). This categorization helps guide the approach to management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-in-children-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H23884815\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heart failure in children: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology and etiology'</a>.)</p><p>The 2014 International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) <a href=\"https://www.ishlt.org/guidelines/standardsStatements.asp&amp;token=+7UzpNO2Mqk//SjcpIx+3TcJDesGUhnAGTFPqG23IKsNHLOUGU5OYC6NEWQs/kfE56rqIMzyi9oLLMTG05P7Vw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=14520\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">guidelines</a> for the treatment of HF in children are primarily based on the adult literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-children-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) can be used in patients who are intolerant of ACE inhibitors. (See <a href=\"#H105074464\" class=\"local\">'Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Based on adult guidelines, beta blockers can be considered in children with asymptomatic systolic LV dysfunction.

After a few weeks of stability, a beta blocker is usually added in patients with persistent left ventricle dilation and dysfunction.

Some patients present in stage D (decompensated state) and after initial acute therapy with inotropes may be able to transition to oral HF therapy as described above for patients in stage C. (See <a href=\"#H105074919\" class=\"local\">'Drug therapy for advanced HF'</a> below and <a href=\"#H105075139\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic interventions for advanced HF'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10100864\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic therapy is primarily used in patients with ventricular pump dysfunction. Drug therapy is also used initially to stabilize and relieve symptoms in patients with either volume or pressure overload with preserved ventricular function who are awaiting correction of the underlying defect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3837090696\"><span class=\"h2\">Evidence for efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most of the agents used in the management of children with HF, the evidence supporting efficacy comes largely from adult studies. Because HF is common in adults, there is a substantial amount of data from large, randomized clinical trials that guide management. Management of HF in adults is based on observations that left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction activates sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin systems. This response is initially physiologic (and compensatory), but persistent activation is maladaptive and contributes to progressive LV dilation and dysfunction (remodeling), and worsening HF. Data from clinical trials have shown that drugs targeted to block the effects of neuro-hormonal activation (eg, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) not only reverse LV remodeling but also improve survival in patients with HF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-beta-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies in adults with HF have shown that a number of drugs provide symptom relief, and improvement in cardiac function and patient outcome. Improvement in symptoms can be achieved by diuretics, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">digoxin</a>, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Prolongation of patient survival has been documented with beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and aldosterone antagonists. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-components-of-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: Components of therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, the ability to conduct similar trials in children is not possible because of the low prevalence of pediatric HF. As a result, treatment of HF in children is based in large part on indirect evidence from adult studies. This approach is supported by observations that children with HF have neuro-hormonal changes and systemic ventricular remodeling similar to that described in adults with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-children-management/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105074464\"><span class=\"h2\">Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HF leads to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and increased sympathetic tone. ACE inhibitors and ARBs inhibit the RAAS, thereby decreasing afterload and promoting reversal of ventricular remodeling with long-term use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10100885\"><span class=\"h3\">ACE inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are an accepted first-line component of therapy for children with stage B and C HF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60553\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60553 \">table 2</a>). Blood pressure and renal function should be closely monitored, especially in neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-children-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Clinical trials in adults have shown that ACE inhibitors improve survival in patients with symptomatic HF and reduce the rate at which asymptomatic patients with severe LV dysfunction develop symptomatic HF.

As previously discussed, large prospective trials with survival as the endpoint are not feasible in pediatric HF.</p><p>Randomized clinical trial data on the use of ACE inhibitors in children are limited and have been difficult to interpret due to healthier baseline cohorts, smaller sample size, and shorter duration of follow-up compared with adult studies. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">enalapril</a> in 18 subjects (mean age 14 years old) who were 4 to 19 years post-Fontan operation, the use of enalapril for 10 weeks was not associated with change in cardiac function or exercise performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-children-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In a subsequent randomized, placebo-controlled study of enalapril in 230 infants with single ventricle anatomy and predominantly normal systemic ventricular function, somatic growth, ventricular function, HF severity, and one-year mortality were similar in the enalapril and placebo groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-children-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In another randomized placebo-controlled trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perindopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">perindopril</a> in 57 children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with normal LV ejection fraction (LVEF), LV function was similar in both groups at the trial's end (three years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-children-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, fewer patients in the perindopril group had LVEF &lt;45 percent at five years (4 versus 28 percent) and fewer deaths were observed in the perindopril group at 10 years (7 versus 34 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-children-management/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The small size of the study limits drawing a firm conclusion regarding a possible mortality benefit.</p><p>Small nonrandomized trials and observational studies in other types of pediatric HF patients have demonstrated physiologic benefits and improvements in short-term outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-children-management/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Other studies have found no benefit or only limited efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-children-management/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Despite the inconsistencies and limitations of the pediatric data, it is reasonable to believe that the well-established benefits of ACE inhibitors in adult HF patients likely apply to pediatric patients as well.</p><p>ACE inhibitors inhibit the formation of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that also promotes myocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and aldosterone secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heart-failure-in-children-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thus, ACE inhibitors benefit patients in HF first by reducing afterload, improving cardiac output, and, on chronic use, by mediating reversal of LV remodeling.
