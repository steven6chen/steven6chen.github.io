These differences have important prognostic implications, which can affect treatment.</p><p>As of the 2016 update of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of central nervous system tumors, oligodendroglial tumors are now more narrowly defined by molecular diagnostics to include only those diffuse gliomas harboring both a mutation in isocitrate dehydrogenase type 1 (<em>IDH1</em>) or type 2 (<em>IDH2</em>) <strong>and</strong> codeletion of chromosomes 1p and 19q [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idh-mutant-1p-19q-codeleted-oligodendrogliomas-clinical-features-pathology-and-prognostic-factors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Mixed oligoastrocytoma no longer exists for fully characterized tumors, but the terminology is retained when referring to historically diagnosed tumors and for tumors with mixed oligoastrocytoma histology for which molecular testing is not available (ie, oligoastrocytoma not otherwise specified [NOS]).

The treatment of these tumors is discussed separately.

Together, oligodendroglioma and anaplastic oligodendroglioma are one-tenth as common as glioblastoma, the most commonly occurring malignant primary brain tumor in adults. Approximately 1000 oligodendroglial tumors are diagnosed in the United States each year. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incidence of primary brain tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1554344620\"><span class=\"h2\">Age of onset</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most oligodendrogliomas present in adults between 25 and 45 years of age. The median age at diagnosis is approximately 5 to 10 years older for World Health Organization (WHO) grade III (anaplastic) tumors compared with WHO grade II (low-grade) tumors. Oligodendrogliomas are occasionally diagnosed in teenagers and in adults over the age of 65 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oligodendrogliomas are slow-growing, infiltrative tumors that may be clinically silent for many years. The most common presenting symptom is seizure, which can be focal or evolving to a bilateral convulsive (secondarily generalized) seizure. Some patients are asymptomatic and diagnosed based on incidental findings at the time of brain imaging performed for another reason (eg, trauma, migraine headaches).</p><p>Focal neurologic deficits and generalized symptoms such as headache are uncommon at the time of diagnosis. As tumors progress, symptoms vary based on tumor location, size, and rate of tumor growth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-brain-tumors-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical features and diagnosis of brain tumors in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most oligodendroglial tumors arise in the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, predominantly in the frontal lobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idh-mutant-1p-19q-codeleted-oligodendrogliomas-clinical-features-pathology-and-prognostic-factors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Rarely, they arise at infratentorial sites and in the spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idh-mutant-1p-19q-codeleted-oligodendrogliomas-clinical-features-pathology-and-prognostic-factors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A multifocal, gliomatosis pattern of involvement can be seen, although it is more commonly associated with astrocytic histology. Leptomeningeal spread can occur but is typically a late development.</p><p>As with other glial tumors, oligodendrogliomas only rarely metastasize outside the central nervous system. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), most low-grade oligodendrogliomas have hyperintense or mixed signal on T2-weighted images and hypointense or mixed signal intensity on T1-weighted images (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F113599\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef113599 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idh-mutant-1p-19q-codeleted-oligodendrogliomas-clinical-features-pathology-and-prognostic-factors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Compared with diffuse astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas are more likely to have indistinct borders and nonuniform signal on T1- and T2-weighted images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idh-mutant-1p-19q-codeleted-oligodendrogliomas-clinical-features-pathology-and-prognostic-factors/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Calcifications, which are characteristic of oligodendroglial tumors but not highly sensitive or specific, are well visualized on computed tomography (CT) and can be seen as low signal intensity on T2-weighted images and dark signal on susceptibility-weighted sequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idh-mutant-1p-19q-codeleted-oligodendrogliomas-clinical-features-pathology-and-prognostic-factors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Most anaplastic oligodendrogliomas are associated with some contrast enhancement, which presumably reflects microvascular proliferation and blood-brain barrier leakage. However, the absence of contrast enhancement does not exclude anaplastic histopathology, nor does its presence exclude low-grade (grade II) histopathology. Up to 50 percent of low-grade oligodendrogliomas have some degree of contrast enhancement.</p><p>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy has the ability to detect 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), the byproduct of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase type 1 (<em>IDH1</em>) or type 2 (<em>IDH2</em>), in a certain percentage of oligodendrogliomas and other <em><span class=\"nowrap\">IDH1/2</em>-mutant</span> gliomas. This may prove useful diagnostically and as a potential biomarker of response to therapy. However, further studies are needed due to limited sensitivity, and the presence of 2HG is not specific for oligodendroglioma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-brain-tumors-in-adults#H355161935\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical features and diagnosis of brain tumors in adults&quot;, section on 'Role of MR spectroscopy and other imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p>None of these imaging findings are specific, and histopathologic examination is required to establish both the tumor type and grade. Sampling error, particularly in patients who undergo only a biopsy, can lead to misclassification and undergrading of a brain tumor. The neuroimaging characteristics of a lesion may guide the surgeon in choosing a site for biopsy, and the presence of enhancement is suggestive of a high-grade tumor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2268108800\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a suspected infiltrative glioma should undergo history, neurologic examination, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast. Additional tests, such as lumbar puncture and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, are not routinely indicated but can provide useful information in selected cases, such as when a demyelinating process is being considered on the differential diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-brain-tumors-in-adults#H475643159\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical features and diagnosis of brain tumors in adults&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-brain-tumors-in-adults#H3413635712\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical features and diagnosis of brain tumors in adults&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Accurate diagnosis of oligodendroglioma and other infiltrative gliomas requires an adequate tissue sample for histopathologic and molecular study. This may be obtained by stereotactic biopsy for deep-seated tumors or at the time of maximal safe resection for tumors in accessible locations. Patients should be referred to a neurosurgeon with subspecialty expertise in brain tumor neurosurgery when possible. Procedure selection is individualized based on suspected tumor type and grade, location, and operability.

More elongated, astrocytic tumor cells can be present and are compatible with the diagnosis of oligodendroglioma in the presence of defining molecular features (ie, <em><span class=\"nowrap\">IDH1/2</em></span> mutation and <span class=\"nowrap\">1p/19q-codeletion)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idh-mutant-1p-19q-codeleted-oligodendrogliomas-clinical-features-pathology-and-prognostic-factors/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. If mixed oligoastrocytic histology is present and genetic testing cannot be performed, such a tumor is diagnosed provisionally as oligoastrocytoma not otherwise specified (NOS). (See <a href=\"#H2946109307\" class=\"local\">'Tumors previously called oligoastrocytoma'</a> below.) </p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) grading system distinguishes two histopathologic grades of oligodendroglioma: grade II (low-grade) and grade III (anaplastic) oligodendroglioma. Grade III tumors are characterized by the presence of anaplastic features (high cell density, mitosis, nuclear atypia, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis) and are associated with worse prognosis compared with grade II tumors. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Tumor grade (II versus III)'</a> below.)</p><p>The natural history of oligodendrogliomas is a gradual progression from low-grade (well-differentiated) tumors into high-grade lesions with anaplastic features. These morphologic changes appear gradually within a tumor, and an objective distinction between oligodendroglioma (low-grade) and anaplastic oligodendroglioma (high-grade) is not always possible.

MGMT is a nuclear enzyme responsible for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair following alkylating-agent chemotherapy and may mediate part of the cellular resistance to alkylating agents. <em>MGMT</em> expression can be silenced by methylation of its promoter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idh-mutant-1p-19q-codeleted-oligodendrogliomas-clinical-features-pathology-and-prognostic-factors/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>Whether these changes account entirely for the sensitivity of oligodendrogliomas to chemotherapy is unclear.

They typically present in adults between 25 and 45 years of age but are occasionally diagnosed in teenagers and adults over the age of 65 years. (See <a href=\"#H58065116\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oligodendrogliomas are slow-growing, infiltrative tumors that may be clinically silent for many years. The most common presenting symptom is seizure. Focal neurologic deficits are uncommon at the time of diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most low-grade oligodendrogliomas have hyperintense or mixed signal on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and hypointense or mixed signal intensity on T1-weighted images (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F113599\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef113599 \">image 1</a>). Contrast enhancement is variable and does not necessarily indicate high-grade (anaplastic) pathology. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis requires an adequate tissue sample for histopathologic and molecular study, including testing for IDH mutation and <span class=\"nowrap\">1p/19q-codeletion</span>. Diagnostic tissue may be obtained by stereotactic biopsy for deep-seated tumors or at the time of maximal safe resection for tumors in accessible locations. Patients should be referred to a neurosurgeon with subspecialty expertise in brain tumor neurosurgery when possible. (See <a href=\"#H2268108800\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite the prolonged clinical course seen with oligodendroglial tumors, the outcome is almost always fatal. In population-based studies, the median overall survival for patients with low-grade oligodendroglioma ranges from 10 to 15 years, and the median survival for patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma ranges from 5 to 9 years. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis and prognostic factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with other diffuse gliomas, IDH-mutant, <span class=\"nowrap\">1p/19q-codeleted</span> oligodendrogliomas are highly chemosensitive. The mechanism of chemosensitivity likely relates in large part to metabolically induced epigenetic changes, including CpG island hypermethylated phenotype (CIMP) and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (<em>MGMT</em>) promotor methylation.
