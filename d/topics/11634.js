This rate is similar to nonpregnant women of childbearing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-during-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H436313749\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Affected patients usually present in the second or third trimester (approximately 20 percent in the first trimester) with acute flank pain (90 percent), which often radiates to the groin or lower abdomen. Hematuria is present in 75 to 95 percent, one-third of whom have gross hematuria, and approximately 40 percent will have pyuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-during-pregnancy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Most of these women do not have a prior history of stone disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-during-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, it is not clear whether such women have a preexisting stone, an underlying tendency to stone formation, or whether factors related to pregnancy are responsible. Normal pregnancy is associated with an increase in urine calcium excretion (243 versus 194 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in one series), lesser increases in urine citrate and magnesium excretion (which protect against stone formation), and a rise in urine pH but not urine volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-during-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The urine supersaturation for calcium oxalate is similar to that in nonpregnant women with calcium stones. Additional factors that contribute to stone formation during pregnancy may include urinary stasis, secondary to increased progesterone levels and diminished fluid intake during late pregnancy, as a result of decreasing bladder capacity from the gravid uterus. In a study of 27 patients who had a procedure to have their stones removed, the composition in 20 was predominantly calcium phosphate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-during-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal and pelvic ultrasound should be performed when an obstructing calculus is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-during-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This modality avoids exposure to radiation and is useful for detecting secondary signs of obstruction, such as hydronephrosis or hydroureter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F91799\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91799 \">image 1</a>). However, physiological hydronephrosis of pregnancy must be distinguished from pathological hydronephrosis from obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F91800\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91800 \">image 2</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Renal and urinary tract physiology&quot;</a>). Rarely, pelvic ultrasound may identify a stone obstructing the distal ureter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F91801\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91801 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-during-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The ability of ultrasonography and other imaging modalities to detect nephrolithiasis was retrospectively evaluated in a study of 57 pregnant women with 73 admissions for symptomatic nephrolithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-during-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. When performed as the initial examination, renal ultrasonography detected calculi in 21 of 35 cases (60 percent sensitivity).</p><p>To avoid radiation exposure, transvaginal ultrasonography should be performed next in those in whom transabdominal ultrasonography is noninformative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-during-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This modality can help detect distal ureteral stones. If the examination is negative, the patient may be treated symptomatically, with hydration and lying on her side, with the symptomatic side up. This can relieve pressure on the ureter from the gravid uterus. Doppler ultrasound has also been utilized to improve the diagnostic accuracy of identifying ureteral calculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-during-pregnancy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>If further diagnosis is required following <span class=\"nowrap\">renal/pelvic</span> ultrasound, transvaginal ultrasonography, and a trial of symptomatic therapy, two additional options are available; they are listed in our order of preference:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance (MR) urography, which is not associated with radiation exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F91802\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91802 \">image 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-dose computed tomography (CT) can be used in the second and third trimester but not the first trimester, when the fetus is most susceptible to radiation-induced injury. Some evidence suggests that low-dose CT is highly sensitive and specific for the detection of renal and ureteral calculi in pregnant women, and the radiation dose should confer a low risk of fetal harm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-during-pregnancy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Computed tomography'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Our recommendations are consistent with those made by the American Urological Association (AUA) technology assessment on imaging in the management of ureteral calculus disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-during-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most (75 to 85 percent) stones pass spontaneously due, in part, to the normally dilated urinary tract in pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-during-pregnancy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-renal-and-urinary-tract-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Renal and urinary tract physiology&quot;</a>). If drugs are needed to relieve pain in such patients, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> is probably the safest choice. The use of nonsteroidal drugs and opioids in pregnant women are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=safety-of-antiinflammatory-and-immunosuppressive-drugs-in-rheumatic-diseases-during-pregnancy-and-lactation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Safety of antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs in rheumatic diseases during pregnancy and lactation&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamsulosin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tamsulosin</a> is classified by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a category B medication. A small, retrospective study of 20 pregnant women with documented renal ureteral calculi found that tamsulosin was safe for the mother and fetus and that it may ultimately be helpful as adjunctive therapy for symptomatic pregnant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-during-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Cystoscopy with insertion of a ureteral stent or ureteroscopy to remove or fragment the stone may be required in the patient who is septic; has persistent, severe pain; or has obstruction in a solitary functioning kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-during-pregnancy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Ureteral stenting or placement of a nephrostomy tube to relieve obstruction or pain is a valid option for managing pregnant patients. However, pregnancy significantly increases the risk of stent encrustation, necessitating the need for frequent ureteral stent exchange every four to six weeks until delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-during-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In patients who fail to spontaneously pass the stone and who develop urinary tract infection, persistent urinary obstruction, or persistent, severe pain, ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy may be an option. Small caliber ureteroscopes minimize or eliminate the need for concomitant fluoroscopic monitoring. If additional monitoring is needed, ultrasonography (no ionizing radiation) or pulsed fluoroscopy (minimal ionizing radiation) can be used. Another option to reduce radiation exposure to the fetus while performing ureteroscopy utilizes an inverted C-arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-during-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Although shock wave lithotripsy has been inadvertently performed in only a few pregnant women, without complications, its use during pregnancy is contraindicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-during-pregnancy/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Ureteroscopic stone removal appears to be similarly safe in pregnant and nonpregnant patients. A 2009 systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 reports noted nine complications with this technique among 108 pregnant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-during-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These included two patients with postoperative pain managed by analgesia, five with urinary tract infections, one with preterm uterine contractions treated by tocolytic, and one with a ureteral perforation managed by a stent. There were no life-threatening complications or deaths. The review also reported that the cases were from centers with operators that were highly skilled, a likely contributor to success with the technique. A similar rate of ureteral injury and urinary tract infection was reported in a multinational meta-analysis of ureteroscopy in nonpregnant patients.</p><p>Holmium laser lithotripsy may be the preferred technique of stone fragmentation during ureteroscopy as this device delivers energy to a localized area, can be used with flexible ureteroscopes, and is effective with stones of all compositions. The potential efficacy was illustrated in a report of eight pregnant women with 10 symptomatic ureteral calculi and two encrusted ureteral stents who underwent ureteroscopy and holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy at a mean gestational age of 22 weeks; the mean stone size was 8.1 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nephrolithiasis-during-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Procedural success was achieved in all but one case (91 percent), with no obstetric or urologic complications.
