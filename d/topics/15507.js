A synchronous SPM is diagnosed simultaneously or within six months of the index tumor, while a metachronous SPM is diagnosed greater than six months after the index tumor. SPMs need to be distinguished from local recurrences or metastasis of the primary tumor.</p><p>Second primary malignancies represent the second leading cause of death in patients with HNSCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. One-quarter to one-third of deaths in these patients are attributable to SPM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>], highlighting the importance of SPM in the successful management of HNSCC.</p><p>The classification, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and management of SPMs of the upper aerodigestive tract after treatment of an initial head and neck cancer will be reviewed here.

This concept was introduced by Slaughter et al [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], who discovered that in oral cancers, the epithelium beyond the boundaries of tumor possessed histologic changes. The classic view of the term &quot;field cancerization&quot; hypothesized that large areas of head and neck mucosa are affected by carcinogen exposure, resulting in a wide field of premalignant disease that gives rise to multiple independent primary tumors.

For example, when both tumors appear in the same anatomic subsite, there is no agreement on the distance that should exist between the tumors, with some investigators favoring 1.5 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and others requiring 2 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Furthermore, when occurring in the same anatomic subsite, some investigators add that the SPM must present at least three years after the diagnosis of the index tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], while others require that the SPM present at least five years after the index tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

The lung is the most common site of distant metastasis in patients with HNSCC, and the incidence may be higher in patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) associated HNSCC. In addition, patients with HNSCC may also have an increased risk of second primary lung malignancies.</p><p>Comparison of genetic alterations is an important method to investigate clonal relationships between HNSCC and solitary lung SCC. Several investigators have employed mutation analysis to differentiate between lung metastasis and second primary lung malignancy when the lung lesion is of squamous origin. Second primary lung malignancies of non-squamous origin do not require mutational analysis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study of 16 patients with HNSCC and a solitary lung squamous cell carcinoma, use of microsatellite analysis clarified the relationship between the lung tumor and primary HNSCC in 13 of 16 patients (81 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The patterns of allelic loss on chromosomal arms 3p and 9p were compared in the HNSCCs and solitary lung SCC. Clonal relationships were present in 10 of 16 patients (63 percent), suggesting metastatic spread. Completely discordant patterns of loss at all loci were identified in 3 of 16 cases (19 percent), suggesting independent tumor origin or a second primary lung malignancy. In 3 of 16 patients (19 percent) concordant allelic loss was present on one chromosomal arm and discordant loss on the other, and determining clonality in these cases was not possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study, microsatellite markers on chromosome arms 3p, 9p, and 17p were used to investigate clonality of multiple squamous cell carcinomas in the aerodigestive tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Furthermore, this increased risk is largely restricted to cancers of the aerodigestive tract and remains relatively constant over time after the initial diagnosis. The incidence of SPM ranges from 2 to 7 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>], and this risk remains constant from the time of initial diagnosis throughout the lifetime of the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Two large contemporary cancer registry studies provide insights into the magnitude and details of the increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/11,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis of 13 cancer registries in Europe, Asia, Australia, and Canada provides data on over 99,000 patients and approximately 490,000 person-years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In this combined database, 10,826 second primaries were identified:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The 20-year cumulative risk of a second cancer was 36 percent, and the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) compared with the general population was 1.86. The SIR is defined as the ratio of observed to expected second cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The most frequent second malignancy was lung cancer (20-year cumulative risk 13 percent, SIR 3.3).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The highest relative increase in risk was for a second head and neck cancer (SIR 11.2).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The increased risk of an SPM decreased with increasing age at the diagnosis of the first cancer. As an example, for patients with a second primary head and neck cancer, the SIR decreased progressively from 14.9 for those less than 56 years of age at the initial diagnosis to 8.4 for those 75 years of age or older. A similar progressive decrease in risk was observed for patients whose second primary was in the lung. Whether this reflected higher background rates of cancer with increasing age in the general population or the effect of other unidentified factors (tobacco, alcohol, genetics) is unclear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second study analyzed the frequency of second malignancies in 75,087 patients identified between 1975 and 2006 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The SIR for a second primary solid tumor was 2.2. This corresponded to an excess absolute risk of 168 cancers per 10,000 patient-years at risk (PYR).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The biggest relative increase in risk was for a second primary cancer of the head and neck (SIR 12.4), and this contributed an excess absolute risk of 60 per 10,000 PYR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The risk of SPM differed significantly by subsite of index HNSCC. The risk of an SPM was highest for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the hypopharynx, followed by oropharynx, oral cavity, and larynx (SIRs 3.5, 3, 2.8, and 1.9, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Subsite-specific trends have changed during the human papillomavirus (HPV) era. In contrast to the other three subsites, there has been a substantial decline in the risk of SPM in patients with oropharynx primary malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/11,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,20</a>]. Before 1990, oropharynx primary malignancies carried the second highest excess burden of SPM, whereas currently oropharynx index cancers carry the lowest risk of SPM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-associated-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human papillomavirus associated head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The incidence of lung cancer was also significantly increased (SIR 3.8). Because of the high frequency of lung cancer, this was the biggest contributor to the absolute increase in cancer incidence (excess annual risk 75 per 10,000 patient years).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Esophageal cancer was also markedly increased in incidence and was a significant contributor to the overall increase in cancer frequency in patients who originally presented with head and neck cancer (SIR 14.2 and excess annual risk 14.2 per 10,000 patient years).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There was only a minimal increase in the risk of solid tumors other than those of the head and neck, lung, and esophagus (SIR 1.1).</p><p/><p>The site of the index cancer influences the most likely site of an SPM. As an example, in a series of 1257 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, patients with an index malignancy arising in the larynx were more like to develop a second primary cancer in the lung, while those arising in the oral cavity were more likely to develop a second primary in the head and neck or esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

These agents are thought to contribute to changes throughout the epithelium, and their continued use is associated with an increased risk of second malignancies. Smoking cessation appears to diminish the risk of a SPM after a diagnosis of head and neck cancer, and smoking cessation counseling is critically important.

Previous treatment for head and neck cancer using external beam RT is associated with a decreased incidence of second primary cancers within the treatment fields. This observation has been attributed to treatment of premalignant epithelium and occult second primary tumors. In a SEER database study of 27,985 patients, the incidence of a second primary head and neck cancer was significantly decreased in those treated with RT compared with those whose primary cancer was managed with surgery (7.7 versus 10.5 percent at 15 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, exposure to RT may be associated with various cancers, such as thyroid cancer or sarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other factors associated with an increased risk of second primary malignancies may include poor oral hygiene, immunologic factors, and genetic factors.

A comprehensive discussion of treatment of each SPM site is beyond the scope of this chapter; however, several treatment principles are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31557089\"><span class=\"h2\">Second primary malignancies of the upper aerodigestive tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The issues and difficulties associated with the treatment of a second primary head and neck malignancy are similar to those for a patient with a recurrent disease.

In general, the SPM should be treated as a separate entity, in the same manner as a primary index tumor at the anatomic subsite.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In many cases, particularly in metachronous SPMs, patients have already received a full complement of treatment, including primary or adjuvant radiation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemoradiation treatment. In these cases, surgical treatment of the SPM is often indicated when feasible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reirradiation is an option in carefully selected cases when salvage surgery is not possible. Proper patient selection for reirradiation is critical, and only patients with minimal comorbidity and toxicity of previous radiation treatment should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Patients at high risk for local recurrence after salvage surgery may benefit from increased locoregional control from adjuvant reirradiation, although there is no survival advantage compared with salvage surgery alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When reirradiation is used, standard doses are required for meaningful opportunity for local control. Factors that need to be considered include the previously treated volume and dose fractionation schedule, critical tissues and organs at risk, and time elapsed since the first treatment course. Local control is best with small, well-differentiated second primary tumors as opposed to recurrent disease. Reirradiation should only be considered if there are no other practical alternatives to treatment since there is an increased risk of serious complications. To minimize the risk of post-treatment complications, intensity modulated radiation therapy should be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].

This seemed to hold up even for histologically different subtypes of cancers (eg, HNSCC versus adenocarcinoma second primary), thus excluding metastasis as an explanation. Although there are no data in this specific patient population, other high risk populations benefit from regularly scheduled low dose screening lung computed tomography (CT), and this should be considered for HNSCC survivors.

The risk of a SPM remains elevated for at least 10 years and is typically restricted to tumors arising in the head and neck, lung, and esophagus. (See <a href=\"#H345501696\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposure to tobacco and alcohol are the primary factors associated with the development of second primary malignancies. The increase in risk of a second primary following a human papillomavirus (HPV) associated malignancy is not increased to the same extent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-primary-malignancies-in-patients-with-head-and-neck-cancers/abstract/11,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differentiating between an SPM, locoregional recurrence, and distant metastasis is not always possible on clinical, radiologic, and pathologic grounds. Newer molecular techniques have emerged that may permit the ability to determine the clonal relationship between two malignancies. Determining whether a lesion represents an SPM or distant metastasis is critical to treatment planning. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification criteria for SPM'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation of a patient with a squamous carcinoma of the head and neck should include a detailed history and examination to exclude a synchronous SPM. Panendoscopy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/computed</span> tomography (CT) may be performed during the initial evaluation to rule out an SPM. Meticulous follow-up is required for early detection of recurrent disease and second primary malignancies. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-staging-of-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the diagnosis and staging of head and neck cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posttreatment-surveillance-of-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posttreatment surveillance of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients presenting with an SPM in the head and neck region present a therapeutic challenge due to the previous treatment received, especially when prior treatment included radiation. In general, the SPM is treated in similar fashion as a primary index tumor at the subsite of origin. If the SPM arises in previous radiation treatment fields, surgical treatment of the SPM is often preferred. Reirradiation can be hazardous, but may be offered in selected cases when the risk-benefit ratio is reasonable and surgery is not an option. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survival in patients with SPM depends upon the location of the SPM. Patients with SPM arising in the head and neck have significantly improved survival when compared with patients with SPM arising in the lung and esophagus.
