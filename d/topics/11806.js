It is particularly important to look for causes of nocturnal enuresis that may require additional evaluation and treatment (eg, diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnea, encopresis or constipation, bowel and bladder dysfunction, etc). It is difficult to successfully treat enuresis if coexistent constipation is not addressed. When evaluating for constipation, it may be helpful to ask about soiling in addition to the usual questions about bowel habits.

The recommendations in this topic review are based upon the recommendations of these groups.</p><p>Management of primary nocturnal enuresis may involve one or a combination of interventions, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Education and reassurance (given the high rate of spontaneous resolution)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motivational therapy (eg, sticker or star chart)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enuresis alarms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Desmopressin</a></p><p/><p>The management of secondary nocturnal enuresis involves addressing the underlying stressor if one can be identified. However, most children with secondary enuresis have no identifiable cause and are treated in the same manner as children with primary enuresis.</p><p>When the parents and child are interested and motivated to work toward long-term management, education and motivational therapies usually are tried initially (for three to six months). More active intervention (eg, enuresis alarm, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">desmopressin</a>) is warranted as the child gets older, social pressures increase, and self-esteem is affected. Enuresis alarms are the most effective long-term therapy, but desmopressin is effective in the short-term (eg, for sleepovers or camp attendance).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602911006\"><span class=\"h3\">Goals of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of interventions for nocturnal enuresis include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To stay dry on particular occasions (eg, sleepover)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To reduce the number of wet nights</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To reduce the impact of enuresis on the child and family</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To avoid recurrence</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602908662\"><span class=\"h3\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before beginning therapy, the pediatric health care provider should define the expectations of the parents and child. Some parents may simply want assurance that the enuresis is not caused by a physical abnormality and are not interested in initiating a long-term treatment program. It is also important to determine whether short-term dryness is a priority (eg, so the child can attend camp or go on a school trip) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Pediatric health care providers should emphasize that bedwetting is not the child's fault and that the child should not be punished for bedwetting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Surveys indicate that between one-fourth and one-third of parents punish their child for wetting the bed, and sometimes the punishment is physically abusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. The possibility that the child is being abused should be considered if the parents report that the child is deliberately wetting the bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Parents or caregivers who are having difficulty coping with bedwetting or are expressing anger, negativity, or blame toward the child may need additional support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The pediatric health care provider should stress to the parents and child that a carefully constructed enuresis treatment program often involves several methods of treatment, used in sequence or combination. The treatment may be prolonged, may fail in the short term, and often is associated with relapses. The parents must be willing to participate, and the family environment must be supportive. Therapy should be goal oriented, and follow-up should be consistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Comorbid constipation should be addressed in conjunction with nocturnal enuresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic functional constipation and fecal incontinence in infants and children: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Treatment of children'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602908167\"><span class=\"h3\">When to initiate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The timing of initiation of treatment for monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis varies from child to child. The major determinants are whether the child and caregivers view the enuresis as a problem and how strongly motivated they are to participate in a treatment program.</p><p>The age at which enuresis is considered to be a &quot;problem&quot; varies depending upon the family. If both parents wet the bed until late childhood, they may not be concerned that their seven-year-old wets the bed. In contrast, parents may be concerned about a four-year-old who wets if he has a three-year-old sibling who is already dry. For the child, nocturnal enuresis usually becomes significant when it interferes with his or her ability to socialize with peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. We offer treatment advice <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> interventions to children with enuresis who have undergone puberty if neither they nor their parents have endorsed enuresis as a problem before then and secondary causes of enuresis (eg, constipation, diabetes) have been excluded.</p><p>It is important to determine whether the child is mature enough to assume responsibility for treatment. Treatment probably should be delayed if it seems that the parents are more interested in treatment than the child and the child is unwilling or unable to assume some responsibility for the treatment program. The child must be highly motivated to participate in a treatment program that may take months to achieve successful results. (See <a href=\"#H602907926\" class=\"local\">'Motivational therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Children younger than seven years usually can be managed with education and motivational therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, age should not be the only criterion for initiation of active treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Enuresis as infrequent as once per month is associated with decreased self-esteem; decreased self-esteem can be improved with treatment, even if the treatment is not completely successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60381896\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications for referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis usually can be managed effectively by the primary care provider. However, children with refractory or nightly nocturnal enuresis may benefit from referral to a health care professional who specializes in the management of recurrent or refractory enuresis (eg, developmental-behavioral pediatrician or urologist if structural or anatomic abnormalities are suspected) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Additional indications for referral include nonmonosymptomatic enuresis; developmental, attentional, or learning difficulties; behavioral or emotional problems; known or suspected physical or neurologic problems; and parents who are having emotional difficulty coping with bedwetting or are expressing anger, negativity, or blame.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602906573\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial management of enuresis usually involves education and motivational therapy and is directed by the primary care provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602906787\"><span class=\"h3\">Education and advice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The guidelines of the International Children's Continence Society, NICE, and Paediatric Society of New Zealand recommend the provision of basic <span class=\"nowrap\">education/advice</span> for children and caregivers of children with nocturnal enuresis as the initial step in management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/4-6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6,16</a>]. The education and advice typically includes the following information:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enuresis is common; it occurs at least once per week in 16 percent of five-year-olds; enuresis resolves on its own in the majority of children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58087\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58087 \">figure 1</a>).

Some authors recommend that their enuretic patients drink 40 percent of their total daily fluid in the morning (7 AM to 12 PM), 40 percent in the afternoon (12 PM to 5 PM), and only 20 percent in the evening (after 5 PM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Ample consumption of fluid in the morning and afternoon reduces the need for significant intake later in the day. Isolated nighttime fluid restriction, without compensatory increase in daytime fluid consumption, may prevent the child from meeting his or her daily fluid requirement and is usually unsuccessful.

Initial rewards should be given for agreed-upon behavior (eg, going to the toilet before bedtime) rather than dryness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Successively larger rewards, agreed upon in advance, are given for longer compliance with agreed-upon behavior and, eventually, for longer periods of dryness (eg, a sticker on a calendar for each dry night, a book for seven consecutive dry nights). Penalties (ie, removal of previously gained rewards) are counterproductive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Motivational therapy is a good first-line therapy for nocturnal enuresis in younger children (between five and seven years of age) who do not wet the bed every night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/5,12,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12,18</a>]. Motivational therapy is estimated to be successful (14 consecutive dry nights) in 25 percent of children and to lead to significant improvement (decrease in enuretic events by &ge;80 percent) in more than 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The relapse rate (more than two wet nights in two weeks) is approximately 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In a systematic review of simple behavioral interventions for nocturnal enuresis, reward systems (eg, star charts) were associated with fewer wet nights, higher cure rates, and lower relapse rates than no treatment, but these results were based on single small trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>If motivational therapy fails to lead to improvement after three to six months, the addition of active interventions may be warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602906580\"><span class=\"h2\">Addition of active therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enuresis alarms and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">desmopressin</a> are effective active therapies for nocturnal enuresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/4,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,22,23</a>]. Each has advantages and disadvantages. The best active intervention for a particular child depends upon how soon a response is desired, the motivation and commitment of the child and family, and the frequency and volume of enuresis.</p><p>Enuresis alarms are the most effective long-term therapy and have few adverse effects. However, they require a long-term commitment (usually three to four months). We suggest an enuresis alarm as the initial active therapy for highly motivated children and families when the child has frequent enuresis (more than twice per week) and short-term improvement is not a priority. (See <a href=\"#H602907166\" class=\"local\">'Enuresis alarms'</a> below.)</p><p>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">desmopressin</a> works best for children with nocturnal polyuria and normal functional bladder capacity. It may be more effective than an enuresis alarm in the short-term but has a higher relapse rate and is more expensive. We suggest desmopressin as the initial active therapy for children and families who seek short-term improvement of enuresis; have failed, refused, or are unlikely to adhere to alarm therapy; or for whom an enuresis alarm is unsuitable.

Approximately 20 percent of children became dry (14 consecutive nights) during therapy (versus 5 percent with placebo, RR for failure 0.82, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.87).

It is the only TCA recommended by the NICE guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Imipramine should be administered one hour before bedtime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Imipramine is supplied in 10 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg tablets. The initial dose is 10 to 25 mg at bedtime and may be increased by 25 mg if there is no response after one week. On average, the bedtime dose is 25 mg for children five to eight years of age and 50 mg for older children. The dose should not exceed 50 mg in children between 6 and 12 years of age and 75 mg in children &ge;12 years of age.</p><p>The response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">imipramine</a> should be assessed after one month.

If imipramine therapy is successful, the family should taper to the lowest effective dose.

Before initiation of therapy with TCA, a thorough cardiac history and family cardiac history should be obtained. A family history of a first-degree relative with premature (&lt;40 years of age) cardiac problems or a personal history of cardiac disease warrants a consultation with a pediatric cardiologist before starting a TCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The pretreatment evaluation also should include a complete history and physical examination, with particular attention to weight, blood pressure and pulse rate, and a baseline electrocardiogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Nonetheless, in single, small trials, waking the child to urinate has been associated with fewer wet nights, higher cure rates, and lower relapse rates than no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/18,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,48</a>].</p><p>We do not suggest waking the child to urinate.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines suggest that waking the child may be used as a practical measure in the short-term management of bedwetting (to reduce the burden of clean-up) but does not promote long-term dryness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Other authors suggest that these interventions may be helpful for young children (eg, four to five years of age) who wet the bed only once per night and have motivated parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Waking also may be helpful for children &ge;8 years who have not responded to initial treatments and choose parental waking over enuresis alarms or an alarm clock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H602906280\"><span class=\"h3\">Alarm clocks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It may be possible to condition older children to wake to void by using an alarm clock (or mobile phone alarm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nocturnal-enuresis-in-children-management/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

One-third of the patients stopped using the alarm within one month. Among those who continued, initial success (14 consecutive dry nights) was obtained in both groups (77 percent in group I and 62 percent in group II). The relapse rate six months after stopping therapy was 24 percent for group I and 15 percent for group II.
