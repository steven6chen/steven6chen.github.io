The expression of the disease varies substantially. The diagnosis of TSC is made clinically.</p><p>The genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis of TSC will be reviewed here. Other aspects of TSC are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberous sclerosis complex: Management and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-manifestations-of-tuberous-sclerosis-complex\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberous-sclerosis-complex-associated-lymphangioleiomyomatosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberous sclerosis complex associated lymphangioleiomyomatosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with an incidence of approximately 1 in 5000 to 10,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. It is caused by a mutation in either the TSC1 gene or the TSC2 gene. De novo mutations account for approximately 80 percent of TSC cases, with TSC2 mutations being approximately four times as common as TSC1 mutations among de novo cases, while the prevalence of TSC1 and TSC2 mutations is approximately equal among familial TSC cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>There are several different explanations for the apparently nonfamilial cases. Most often, such cases result from a de novo mutation in the egg or sperm prior to fertilization. In addition, the parent may be a somatic mosaic where a subset of somatic and germ cells carry the mutation, or a gonadal mosaic in which mosaicism is confined to the parental germline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In germline mosaicism, there may be more than one egg or sperm that contains the mutation, which can result in more than one sibling affected with the disease (ie, there is an appreciable recurrence risk). Finally, in a child with no affected parents or siblings, TSC may be the result of somatic mosaicism where the mutation occurred during the child's development and after fertilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Once a &quot;de novo&quot; germline mutation occurs in an individual, their offspring may inherit TSC, which then appears as a familial trait in subsequent generations. (See <a href=\"#H140866732\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> below.)</p><p>TSC is highly variable in its expression, that is, in the range of phenotypic changes such as age of onset, severity of disease, and different signs and symptoms that result from a specific genotype. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-genetic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of genetic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Thus, the severity of disease in TSC can vary substantially among affected individuals within the same family, and particularly from one family to another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The variability is due to multiple causes. These include somatic mosaicism (individuals who have low-level mosaicism for a TSC-associated mutation may be very mildly affected) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], differences between TSC1 and TSC2 genes, a variety of mutation types found in each gene, and the requirement for a secondary somatic mutation in the wild-type copy of the gene for the development of many pathologic features of TSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The latter feature is consistent with the two-hit hypothesis of Knudson, in which one mutation is inherited and the second is acquired in somatic tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinoblastoma-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinoblastoma: Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Mutations in two separate genes, TSC1 and TSC2, were first identified in genetic linkage analysis of families with TSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Both genes were subsequently cloned and the spectrum of mutations in TSC patients described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19,20</a>]. A disease-causing mutation can be identified by mutation analysis in 60 to 89 percent of patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for TSC, including approximately 50 percent with mutations in TSC2 and 17 percent with mutations in TSC1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">The TSC1 gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The TSC1 gene, which maps to chromosome 9q34, spans 50 kb of genomic DNA and contains 23 exons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It encodes a protein termed hamartin, which is widely expressed in normal tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Hamartin forms a complex with the tuberin protein that is encoded by the TSC2 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The functions of these proteins are described below. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of tumor formation'</a> below.)</p><p>Several different types of TSC1 mutations have been identified, most of which result in a truncated protein with loss of function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Mutations include large deletions or rearrangements (&lt;5 percent), small deletions and insertions (50 percent), point mutations that result in premature termination of translation (ie, nonsense mutations, 35 percent), and mutations that interfere with splicing of the message (5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,21,22,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,21,22,26,27</a>]. In contrast to TSC2, missense mutations (ie, those that result in substitution of one amino acid for another) are very rare in the TSC1 gene. In patients without a family history of the disease, the majority of mutations are in the TSC2 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,22,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22,28,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">The TSC2 gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The TSC2 gene, which maps to chromosome 16p13.3, spans 45 kB of genomic DNA and contains 42 exons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The gene is ubiquitously expressed in all normal adult tissues, and encodes the tuberin protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Tuberin forms a complex with the hamartin protein, the product of the TSC1 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>TSC2 functions in normal brain development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] and in withdrawal of the normal cardiomyocyte from the cell cycle during terminal differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This latter finding is intriguing in view of the benign cardiac tumors (rhabdomyomas) that are observed in TSC. (See <a href=\"#H230292317\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>As with TSC1, the majority of mutations identified in TSC2 are loss of function mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,22,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22,33</a>]. Large deletions and rearrangements of the TSC2 gene are more common than with TSC1 (15 versus &lt;5 percent of the mutations) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>], while small deletions and insertions, nonsense mutations, and splicing mutations occur in 35, 20, and 5 percent of cases, respectively. In contrast to TSC1, approximately 25 percent of TSC2 mutations are missense mutations.</p><p>In some cases, the mutant tuberin protein is made but inhibits tuberin phosphorylation, preventing the formation of the tuberin-hamartin complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Other mutations in both TSC1 and TSC2 also disrupt the interaction between these two proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of tumor formation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several lines of evidence support the view that the TSC genes function as tumor suppressor genes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inactivating mutations or complete loss of TSC genes are found in patients with TSC, and loss of heterozygosity at these gene loci characterize TSC-associated tumors (eg, hamartomas, angiofibromas, and lymphangioleiomyomas) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,36-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,36-40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In animal models, germline mutations that disrupt either the Tsc2 or Tsc1 predispose to hereditary clear cell renal cell carcinoma as well as multiple subependymal and extrarenal tumors such as subcortical hamartomas, similar to those encountered in patients with TSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reintroduction of wild-type, but not mutant, TSC protein suppresses tumor formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of tuberin and hamartin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insights concerning the function of tuberin were first provided by the observation that its C-terminal end has extensive sequence homology with the catalytic domain of the GTPase activating protein 3 (GAP3), which stimulates the intrinsic activity of GTPases. These enzymes cleave a phosphate group from GTP to form GDP, thus inactivating GTP-binding proteins such as ras, and the ras-like proteins Rap1a and rab5a [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The ras superfamily of proteins is central to a wide range of cellular processes, including control of the cell cycle. Tuberin stimulates the GTPase activity of Rap1a but not ras or other ras-like proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>It is hypothesized that lack of tuberin (or a functional tuberin-hamartin complex) results in loss of GTPase activity, and inappropriate or constitutive activation of these proteins, thereby releasing an inhibitory influence on the cell cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,30,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,30,46</a>]. The net result is that cells spend less time in G1, the resting phase of the cell cycle, and quiescent cells are induced to enter the cell cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. As an example, cardiomyocytes from whole embryo cultures derived from rats with germline TSC2 gene mutations show sustained DNA synthesis along with an inability to undergo terminal differentiation and exit from the cell cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>There appears to be a direct interaction of polycystin 1, the protein product of the PKD1 gene, with tuberin in kidney epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The implications of this finding remain undefined. However, interactions of polycystin 1 with tuberin could provide another area of cell cycle modulation and possibly contribute to the development of renal angiomyolipomas commonly seen in patients with TSC.</p><p>The contribution of hamartin to the molecular pathogenesis of tumors in TSC is predominately related to the stabilization of the tuberin protein, thereby allowing the protein complex to function normally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of mTOR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important advancement in our understanding of TSC is the delineation of the role of the hamartin-tuberin complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F58634\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58634 \">figure 1</a>) through inhibition of cellular signaling mediated by the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,24,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24,51,52</a>]. The mTOR pathway is important for regulating protein translation (in response to nutrition), cell cycle progression, and response to hypoxia. As an example, in vitro studies suggest that angiomyolipomas in TSC are associated with intracellular phosphorylation of targets known to be the result of activation of mTOR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p>Both protein kinase B and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) are modulators of the mTOR pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. These protein kinases, particularly ERK, may be involved in the development of TSC-associated tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. The role of hamartin-tuberin complex in mTOR signaling led to the development of the mTOR inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a>, the first agent for treatment of patients with TSC. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis#H140858574\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberous sclerosis complex: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Everolimus and mTOR inhibitors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TSC is characterized by the development of a variety of benign tumors in multiple organs, including the brain, heart, skin, eyes, kidney, lung, and liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,57</a>]. In addition, there is an increased risk of malignancy in TSC. Nearly all patients with TSC have one or more of the skin lesions characteristic of the disorder. Most patients with TSC have epilepsy, and one-half or more have cognitive deficits and learning disabilities; other common manifestations include autism, behavioral problems, and psychosocial difficulties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Collectively, these are termed TSC-associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. These problems are usually associated with brain lesions including glioneuronal hamartomas (also called tubers), periventricular giant cell astrocytomas, and abnormalities of cerebral white matter detected on neuroimaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,60</a>] (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Brain lesions'</a> below).

These nodules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F52792\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52792 \">image 2</a>) are indistinguishable histologically from SGCT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64578\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64578 \">image 3</a>) except for their small size.</p><p>Cortical glioneuronal hamartomas and subependymal nodules are present on brain MRI in approximately 90 percent of children with TSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/67,74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,74,75</a>]. The detection rate of these lesions is moderately lower on CT. Cortical glioneuronal hamartomas may be calcified on CT scan in approximately one-half of patients, and subependymal nodules are usually calcified on CT except in the early years of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/74,76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,76,77</a>]. In order to minimize radiation exposure, the use of CT monitoring for children with TSC should be limited.

Although most often called &quot;subependymal giant cell astrocytomas&quot; (SEGAs), they are of mixed glioneuronal lineage; thus &quot;subependymal giant cell tumors&quot; (SGCTs) is a more accurate description. The prevalence of SGCTs in TSC ranges from 5 to 20 percent in different studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As noted, the distinction between subependymal nodules and SGCTs may be largely semantic. Immunohistochemistry studies in mouse model of TSC suggest that both glioneuronal hamartomas and SGCTs share a functionally related neuroglial progenitor cell of origin, and that both result from aberrant neuroglial differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. It is not clear why neoplastic transformation to SGCTs may occur in subependymal nodules and not in cortical glioneuronal hamartomas. In addition, growing evidence from radiologic studies supports the hypothesis that SGCTs can arise from the growth of preexisting subependymal nodules, the latter occurring in 88 to 95 percent of children with TSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/84-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-86</a>].

In the absence of better data, however, size &ge;10 mm may still be a useful criterion for identifying SGCTs.

These linear lesions are hyperintense on T2 weighted MRI and are either isointense or hypointense on T1 images.

The majority of cortical glioneuronal hamartomas show homogeneous high signal on FLAIR MRI images. However, some cortical glioneuronal hamartomas, sometimes called &quot;cyst-like&quot; though they are not true cysts, show central low signal intensity on FLAIR and T1-weighted sequences and increased signal on T2-weighted sequences. In a retrospective study of 173 patients with TSC, epilepsy was significantly more frequent in patients with compared with those without at least one cortical glioneuronal hamartoma of low FLAIR and T1 signal intensity (92 versus 76 percent, RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.07-1.40) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].

Thereafter, cardiac rhabdomyomas usually undergo spontaneous regression. The morbidity and mortality associated with these tumors reflect the potential for flow abnormalities if they grow to sufficient size to restrict blood flow.

This was almost entirely due to the increased incidence of brain tumors and rhabdomyosarcoma.

It is also useful for preimplantation or prenatal diagnosis, and to identify whether other at-risk relatives (eg, parents or siblings) carry the mutation. International TSC guidelines recommend genetic testing when the diagnosis of TSC is suspected or in question but cannot be clinically confirmed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Disease-causing mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes can be detected in 75 to 90 percent of patients who meet the diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,21,22,67,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,21,22,67,70</a>]. Because of the wide spectrum of mutation mechanisms, full sequencing plus analysis for small- and large-scale deletions of both TSC1 and TSC2 genes is necessary for a comprehensive molecular diagnosis of patients with suspected TSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Since 10 to 25 percent of individuals with TSC have no mutation identified by genetic testing, a negative mutation test does not exclude the diagnosis of TSC in an apparently affected child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Furthermore, a positive test does not predict either the severity or nature of the disease complications. One cause of a negative genetic test is the presence of somatic mosaicism, which is estimated to occur in 2 to 10 percent of de novo cases of TSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In somatic mosaicism, the mutation in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene is not present in all cells. This occurs when the mutation occurs in the developing embryo and results in a variable mixture of normal and affected cells in different tissues. In individuals with mosaicism, mutation testing performed on DNA from blood leukocytes may be normal, depending upon the degree of mosaicism in the blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Also, parents who are negative on genetic testing for the TSC mutation found in their affected child may still carry this mutation as either a low level somatic or germline mosaic. Thus, they may be at risk for having future children affected with TSC.

The skin manifestations are most apparent on the face. Use of a Wood's lamp may facilitate the identification of hypopigmented macules. The presence or absence of each of the major dermatologic features should be specifically recorded in the medical record.

This evaluation should include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing for the familial TSC mutation if a TSC1 or TSC2 mutation has been identified in the child</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A thorough examination of the skin (in normal light and with a Wood's lamp)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ophthalmic examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cranial MRI (preferably) or CT scan</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging (eg, MRI of the abdomen or renal ultrasound) is indicated to evaluate for the presence of renal angiomyolipomas or renal cysts</p><p/><p>The importance of determining whether a parent is affected lies in providing appropriate follow-up for the parent, eg, screening for renal disease, and in providing an appropriate risk estimate of having a subsequent child with TSC. Because TSC is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, the risk of this disorder in each offspring of an affected parent is 50 percent. However, if neither parent meets the clinical criteria for TSC, the risk of the parents having another child with TSC is only about 1 to 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This risk, which is higher than expected if it were due to a second de novo mutation, is due to either somatic or germ-line mosaicism, which occurs when either parent carries the mutation in more than one egg or sperm cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. As mentioned previously, an adult who is mosaic for a severe mutation (eg, a truncating mutation in TSC2) may be mildly affected. However, any offspring who inherit this mutation will <strong>not</strong> be mosaic; they will carry the mutation in every cell of the body and may be severely affected. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H314610629\"><span class=\"h2\">Preimplantation and prenatal testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reproductive decisions by couples are facilitated by appropriate genetic counseling. Prospective parents should be aware that TSC exhibits wide clinical variability within families and that establishing the diagnosis prenatally cannot predict the severity or outcome. The couple should also understand that their risk of having an affected child could be substantially lowered by use of reproductive technologies including sperm or oocyte donation, depending upon which parent is affected.</p><p>Preimplantation or prenatal genetic testing with DNA analysis can be performed in families in which a specific mutation in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene has been identified in an affected family member.</p><p>For families where a specific TSC mutation is identified, the couple may elect to use preimplantation genetic diagnosis. This involves single cell analysis after biopsy of an embryo obtained through in vitro fertilization and subsequent implantation of embryos at low risk of carrying the mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tuberous-sclerosis-complex-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>]. Prenatal testing for TSC1 or TSC2 mutations of specimens obtained during pregnancy through either chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis is also available to couples.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H230288106\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of TSC is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberous-sclerosis-complex-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberous sclerosis complex: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H140866924\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with an incidence of approximately 1 in 5000 to 10,000 live births. It is caused by mutations in two separate genes, TSC1 and TSC2. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TSC is characterized by the development of variety of benign tumors in multiple organs, including the brain, heart, skin, eyes, kidney, lung, and liver. In addition, there is an increased risk of malignancy in TSC. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nearly all patients with TSC have one or more of the skin lesions characteristic of the disorder. The most common skin lesions in TSC are hypopigmented macules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61601\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61601 \">picture 1</a>), angiofibromas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54868\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54868 \">picture 3</a>), shagreen patches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91045\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91045 \">picture 4</a>), and fibrous plaques (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78688\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78688 \">picture 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Dermatologic features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain lesions characteristic of TSC include glioneuronal hamartomas, also called cortical tubers, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71505\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71505 \">image 1</a>), white matter heterotopia, subependymal nodules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F52792\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52792 \">image 2</a>), and subependymal giant cell tumors (SGCT), which are also known as subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64578\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64578 \">image 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Brain lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with TSC have epilepsy, and one-half or more have cognitive deficits and learning disabilities. Autism and autistic behaviors are common in children with TSC. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Seizures'</a> above and <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive deficits'</a> above and <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Autism and behavioral problems'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The characteristic cardiac feature of TSC is a rhabdomyoma. Angiomyolipomas are the most common renal manifestation of TSC. Benign cysts and lymphangiomas also can occur. Some adults with TSC develop pulmonary disease that is indistinguishable from the diffuse interstitial fibrosis known as lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Ophthalmic findings in TSC include both retinal and non-retinal abnormalities, although they rarely impact vision. (See <a href=\"#H230292317\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H140867425\" class=\"local\">'Renal manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H140867478\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H230292235\" class=\"local\">'Ophthalmic manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of TSC is based upon genetic testing and clinical criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66759\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66759 \">table 1</a>). The identification of either a TSC1 or TSC2 pathogenic mutation is sufficient to make a definite diagnosis of TSC. Genetic testing is not required for patients who fulfill clinical criteria for definite TSC, but it is useful for confirming the diagnosis in individuals with possible TSC, for reproductive planning, and for identifying at-risk family members. (See <a href=\"#H140866458\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H140866536\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all individuals with suspected TSC, we suggest molecular genetic testing for disease-causing mutations in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes. However, a negative mutation test does not exclude the diagnosis of TSC in an apparently affected child, particularly due to the possibility of mosaicism. Although there is some association of mutation type and gene involved, the mutation result does not completely predict either the severity or nature of the disease complications. (See <a href=\"#H140866732\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the diagnosis is made in a child with no family history of the disorder, both parents should be carefully evaluated for features of TSC. (See <a href=\"#H314610607\" class=\"local\">'Parental evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of TSC is reviewed separately.
