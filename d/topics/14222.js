The major limitations to survival in the early (first one year) post-transplant period are nonspecific graft failure, multiorgan failure, acute rejection, and infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV, also called transplant coronary artery disease or cardiac transplant vasculopathy) is among the top three causes of death, after malignancy as shown in the reports of the Registry of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis after cardiac transplantation&quot;, section on 'Causes of death'</a>.)</p><p>The approach to the prevention and treatment of CAV will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis of allograft vasculopathy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-and-risk-factors-for-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of and risk factors for cardiac allograft vasculopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history and diagnosis of allograft vasculopathy are discussed separately, but the major findings will be reviewed here. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of cardiac allograft vasculopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Summarized briefly:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The heart is denervated at the time of transplant and reinnervation is generally incomplete. As a result, vasculopathy generally progresses silently and, in some cases, rapidly. Because of afferent denervation, affected patients seldom present with classic symptoms of angina. Silent myocardial infarction, sudden death, and progressive heart failure are common presentations. Symptoms associated with exertion, such as dyspnea, diaphoresis, gastrointestinal distress, presyncope, or syncope, are often infrequent, atypical, and may be misleading.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thus, if early diagnosis is to improve outcomes, it must be made by screening studies rather than waiting to evaluate symptoms. The most common screening approach is yearly coronary angiography. Intravascular (intracoronary) ultrasound <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) has been the diagnostic approach of choice in several cardiac transplant centers. However, neither is routinely covered by third party payers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography is a reasonable substitute for screening coronary angiography after five years post-transplant or if renal dysfunction substantially increases the risk of contrast nephropathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The angiographic incidence of allograft vasculopathy is 2 to 28 percent at one year and 40 to 70 percent at five years after cardiac transplantation. Late onset appears to be uncommon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using angiographic monitoring, the multicenter Cardiac Transplant Research Database of 2609 patients transplanted between 1990 and 1995 found some angiographic evidence of coronary disease in 42 percent at five year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, only 7 percent had severe coronary disease, which was defined as left main coronary artery stenosis &gt;70 percent, stenosis of two or more primary coronary arteries &gt;70 percent, or branch stenosis in all three systems &gt;70 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with angiographically significant CAV or severe intimal thickening on IVUS have high rates of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>] and nonfatal cardiac events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]. In the above report from the Cardiac Transplant Research Database, death or retransplantation due to coronary disease occurred in 7 percent overall compared with two-thirds of those with severe coronary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p>However, many patients with clinical cardiac events do not have significant disease on angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This is due to the nature of CAV, which often narrows the coronary arteries in a diffuse and concentric pattern, as opposed to the focal and eccentric pattern of nontransplant atherosclerosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82741\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82741 \">figure 1</a>). As a result, angiography underestimates the severity of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the poor outcome in patients with established CAV, effective prevention is needed. There is proven benefit from lipid lowering therapy, mTOR inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>), and possibly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Statins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac transplant recipients have a high incidence of hyperlipidemia. Statin therapy improves patient survival and reduces the incidence and severity of CAV and allograft rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The trials supporting these conclusions, the goal values for LDL cholesterol, and the possible role of other lipid-lowering drugs are discussed in detail separately. The following discussion will review these trials briefly with emphasis on the beneficial effect on CAV. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipid-abnormalities-after-cardiac-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipid abnormalities after cardiac transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pravastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pravastatin</a> therapy on the incidence of CAV was evaluated in a randomized, prospective open-label trial of 97 transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Pravastatin was begun at a dose of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> one to two weeks after transplantation; if tolerated, the dose was increased to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> at one month. In addition to its beneficial effects on the lipid profile, pravastatin was associated at one year with a significant reduction in the incidence of CAV as determined by angiography or autopsy (6 versus 20 percent), a lower maximal intimal thickness on IVUS, and a significant increase in patient survival (94 versus 78 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66561\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66561 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>These benefits persisted at ten years even though 42 percent of the control group crossed over to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pravastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pravastatin</a> during the second year of the study and 81 percent of control patients were eventually treated with a statin, resulting in similar serum cholesterol concentrations in the two groups between two and ten years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Similar improvements in outcome were noted in a second prospective trial in which 72 heart transplant recipients were randomly assigned to active treatment with a low cholesterol diet plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simvastatin</a> or general dietary therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Simvastatin was started on the fourth postoperative day with dose adjustments at four and ten weeks to a maximum dose of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.</p><p>At four years, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">simvastatin</a> therapy was associated with a lower incidence of CAV (17 versus 42 percent) and improved survival (89 versus 70 percent). There was no difference in the incidence of rejection, although serious rejection episodes tended to be less frequent in the simvastatin group (2.8 versus 13.5 percent). The vascular benefits increased further at eight years even though, at four years, all patients in the control arm were treated with simvastatin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60917\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60917 \">figure 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In addition to lipid-lowering, the benefits of statins may be related to a number of other factors. These include inhibition of inflammatory activity and cytokine activation, attenuation of endothelial dysfunction, and immunosuppressive activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy/abstract/8,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12,13</a>].
