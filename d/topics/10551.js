Progression of atheromatous plaque at the carotid bifurcation results in luminal narrowing, often accompanied by ulceration. This process can lead to ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) from embolization, thrombosis, or hemodynamic compromise.</p><p>Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is established as safe and effective by randomized controlled trials for reducing the risk of ischemic stroke in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with carotid artery atherosclerosis. Advances in medical management and percutaneous carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) are proposed alternatives to CEA that may impact the future use of surgical revascularization techniques for carotid disease.</p><p>This topic will review the treatment of symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease. The management of asymptomatic carotid disease is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asymptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other aspects of carotid occlusive disease are reviewed elsewhere.

The definition is contingent on the occurrence of carotid symptoms within the previous six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Thus, although there is no precise time limitation, remote carotid symptoms should not be considered as indicative of &quot;symptomatic&quot; carotid disease.</p><p>Vertigo and syncope are not generally caused by carotid stenosis. Therefore, patients with these symptoms in isolation should be considered as asymptomatic with regard to carotid disease even if they are found to have carotid artery stenosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CAROTID ENDARTERECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Randomized controlled trials have established carotid endarterectomy (CEA) as safe and effective for reducing the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with symptomatic carotid artery atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Given the available data discussed below, we recommend CEA rather than medical management alone, and we suggest CEA rather than carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) for patients with recently symptomatic carotid stenosis of 70 to 99 percent and a life expectancy of at least five years who meet all of the following conditions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A surgically accessible carotid lesion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of clinically significant cardiac, pulmonary, or other disease that would greatly increase the risk of anesthesia and surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No prior ipsilateral endarterectomy</p><p/><p>This recommendation applies only when the perioperative risk of stroke and death with CEA for the surgeon or center is &lt;6 percent. Some patients who do not meet these conditions may be appropriate candidates for CAS. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Carotid stenting'</a> below.)</p><p>Low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (81 to 325 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> treatment is recommended for all patients who are having CEA. Aspirin should be started prior to surgery and continued for at least three months after surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carotid-endarterectomy#H93838520\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carotid endarterectomy&quot;, section on 'Antiplatelet therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Beyond three months, continued antiplatelet therapy is indicated for most patients to prevent cardiovascular disease, particularly for those with a history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack of atherothrombotic, lacunar (small vessel occlusive type), or cryptogenic type. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiplatelet-therapy-for-secondary-prevention-of-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The utility of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in general is discussed in detail separately.

Comparison of the two major trials of endarterectomy &ndash; the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) &ndash; requires an understanding of how carotid artery stenosis was measured since these studies used different methodologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F58353\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58353 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NASCET measured the residual lumen diameter at the most stenotic portion of the vessel and compared this with the lumen diameter in the normal internal carotid artery distal to the stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ECST measured the lumen diameter at the most stenotic portion of the vessel, but compared this with the estimated probable original diameter at the carotid bulb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p>The maximum stenosis is generally in the carotid bulb, a wider portion of the artery than the distal segment. As a result, a given stenosis would be more severe using the ECST method compared with that of NASCET. ECST methodology also requires an estimation of the true bulb diameter, which increases the risk of interobserver variability.</p><p>Despite these differences, the results of different methods have a nearly linear relationship to each other and provide data of similar prognostic value. A 50 percent stenosis with the NASCET method is equivalent to a 65 percent stenosis for the ECST method, while a 70 percent stenosis with the NASCET method is equivalent to an 82 percent stenosis for the ECST method. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-carotid-artery-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of carotid artery stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Conventional contrast angiography is the gold standard for the evaluation of the true severity of internal carotid artery stenosis. However, noninvasive tests &mdash; carotid duplex ultrasound (CDUS), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and computed tomographic angiography (CTA) &mdash; are preferred in current clinical practice because contrast angiography is an invasive procedure associated with a risk of stroke and other complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroimaging of acute ischemic stroke&quot;, section on 'Conventional angiography'</a>.)</p><p>The available clinical data suggest that the noninvasive tests (CDUS, MRA, and CTA) are sufficiently accurate and reliable that they can be used to select symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis who can benefit from endarterectomy or stenting. This issue is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-carotid-artery-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of carotid artery stenosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carotid-endarterectomy#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carotid endarterectomy&quot;, section on 'Preoperative evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">NASCET trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NASCET was initiated in the mid-1980s to investigate the efficacy of CEA compared with medical treatment in patients with symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This randomized, prospective, multi-center trial enrolled 659 patients who had had a hemispheric or retinal transient ischemic attack (TIA) or a nondisabling stroke within the 120 days before entry and had stenosis of 70 to 99 percent in the symptomatic (ipsilateral) carotid artery.</p><p>The study was prematurely terminated because of evidence that surgery was beneficial in this selected group of patients. At the time of study termination, patients had been followed for a mean of 18 months. Although the risk of stroke and death was higher at 30 days in the patients treated with CEA (5.8 versus 3.3 percent with medical therapy), the following statistically significant benefits for CEA were observed at two years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lower risk of any stroke or death (15.8 versus 32.3 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lower risk of any ipsilateral stroke (9 versus 26 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75669\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75669 \">figure 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lower risk of major or fatal ipsilateral stroke (2.5 versus 13.1 percent) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lower risk of any major stroke or death (8.0 versus 19.1 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67964\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67964 \">figure 3</a>)</p><p/><p>The trialists concluded that CEA was highly beneficial for patients with recent TIAs or nondisabling strokes with ipsilateral stenosis of 70 to 99 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In a subsequent report, the NASCET trial demonstrated that CEA also had a moderate degree of benefit for patients with 50 to 69 percent symptomatic ipsilateral stenosis compared with those receiving medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, the overall statistical significance favoring surgery was marginal; the five-year rate of any ipsilateral stroke for endarterectomy versus medical treatment was 15.7 versus 22.2 percent (p = 0.045). Patients with stenosis of less than 50 percent did not benefit from surgery.</p><p>Follow-up of the NASCET cohort continued for an additional seven years. The benefits of CEA in patients with 70 to 99 percent stenosis continued to be evident after this prolonged period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Subset analysis found that patients who were age 75 and older with 50 to 99 percent stenosis benefited more from CEA than younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Others have reported similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These findings suggest that CEA should not be withheld from appropriately selected, fit patients over the age of 75.</p><p>Predictors of medical complications with CEA were a history of myocardial infarction or angina and hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, or heart failure were excluded from NASCET, perhaps in part explaining the low perioperative medical complication rate.</p><p>The NASCET surgical results study examined rates of perioperative stroke and death at 30 days, stroke severity at 90 days, variables that influenced perioperative risk, and the durability of CEA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Five baseline variables were predictive of increased surgical risk: hemispheric (versus retinal) TIA as the qualifying event; left sided procedure; contralateral carotid occlusion; ipsilateral ischemic lesion on CT scan; and irregular or ulcerated ipsilateral plaque.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">ECST trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ECST was a multi-center, prospective trial that randomly assigned 2518 patients with a nondisabling ischemic stroke, TIA, or retinal infarct due to a stenotic lesion in the ipsilateral carotid artery to medical therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The first report included 374 patients with a mild stenosis (0 to 29 percent) and 778 patients with severe stenosis (70 to 99 percent). After a three-year follow-up, the following findings were noted in the interim report:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with mild stenosis had little risk of ipsilateral ischemic stroke; possible benefits of CEA were small and were outweighed by the early risks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65469\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65469 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At 30 days, the incidence of stroke or death was 7.5 percent in the patients with a severe stenosis who underwent CEA; the risk of these complications was not related to the severity of the stenosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75272\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75272 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At three years, patients treated with CEA had significant reductions in the incidence of ipsilateral ischemic stroke (2.8 versus 16.8 percent with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> alone) and in the total risk of surgical death, surgical stroke, ipsilateral ischemic stroke, or any other stroke (12.3 versus 21.9 percent). The risk varied with age and sex, with benefit being less likely in women and over a narrower range of carotid stenosis in younger patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67785\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67785 \">figure 6</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p>A subsequent final report from ECST, based upon an ultimate total of 3024 patients followed for a mean of six years, noted two major findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CEA was beneficial for symptomatic carotid stenosis of 80 to 99 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of a major ischemic stroke ipsilateral to the unoperated carotid artery increased with the severity of the stenosis, particularly above 80 percent, but only for two to three years after randomization</p><p/><p>Overall, the ECST confirmed the results of the NASCET trial, demonstrating a benefit with CEA in symptomatic patients with severe ipsilateral carotid stenosis, although age and sex were important considerations in a decision about surgery. The reduced risk of recurrent stroke associated with CEA was durable during at least 10 years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Even in the areas where NASCET and ECST appeared to disagree (eg, in patients with less than 80 percent stenosis), a reanalysis of the data suggests that if the same measurement criteria were used, these differences would disappear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Prerandomization carotid angiograms from ECST were reassessed by the NASCET method, and outcomes were standardized to achieve comparability among the trials. The following observations were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CEA was beneficial for patients with greater than 70 percent symptomatic stenosis (but not near occlusion). The number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one stroke over five years for this group was 6.3, with an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 16 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No significant benefit of CEA with near occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) was observed. (Near occlusion is defined by the angiographic appearance of a collapsed ICA distal to the stenosis, accompanied by faster filling in the external carotid artery, and preferential filling of the intracranial circulation from collateral vessels). The ARR over two years with CEA for near occlusion was 5.6 percent, but the lack of benefit became apparent over five years, when the ARR was negative (-1.7 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CEA was beneficial for patients with 50 to 69 percent symptomatic stenosis. The NNT to prevent one stroke over five years in this group was 22, with an ARR of 4.6 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CEA was not beneficial for symptomatic carotid stenosis of 30 to 49 percent, and CEA was harmful for symptomatic patients with less than 30 percent stenosis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Perioperative complication rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combined morbidity and mortality that exceeds 6 percent for patients with symptomatic stenosis could eliminate the benefit gained from CEA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. However, the utility of this finding is limited in practice, since it may be difficult to obtain the appropriate perioperative complication rates for individual surgeons or centers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence from population-based and hospital-based studies suggests that the risk of early recurrent stroke is high following TIA or stroke associated with carotid stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. However, the optimal timing of CEA in patients with symptomatic carotid atherosclerosis has been the subject of considerable debate. The debate is framed mainly by two conflicting observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First, a post hoc analysis of the pooled NASCET and ECST trial data suggests that CEA within two weeks of a nondisabling stroke or TIA improves outcomes compared with later surgery. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'After mild stroke or TIA'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second, findings from observational studies suggest that CEA within the first 48 hours of a carotid stroke or TIA is associated with an elevated risk of recurrent stroke compared with later surgery. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Very early or emergent CEA'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Data are lacking that would reconcile these observations; no high-quality prospective, randomized trials have specifically evaluated outcomes related to the timing of CEA after a recent stroke or TIA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Nevertheless, the highest quality evidence is that supporting CEA within the first two weeks, as discussed in the next section. Therefore, for patients with carotid stenosis and a nondisabling stroke or TIA, we suggest that CEA be performed within two weeks, but not within the first two days, from the time of the last symptomatic event rather than a later time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">After mild stroke or TIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pooled analysis of the NASCET and the ECST trials, representing the largest experience to date, found that CEA within two weeks of a nondisabling stroke or TIA significantly improved outcomes compared with later surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70338\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70338 \">figure 7</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The following observations were reported.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the subgroup of patients with 70 percent or greater carotid stenosis, CEA was associated with a 30.2 percent reduction in absolute risk of stroke in patients randomized within two weeks of their last event, compared with a 17.6, 11.4, and 8.9 percent absolute reduction in those randomized 2 to 4, 4 to 12, and more than 12 weeks from their last event.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with 50 to 69 percent stenosis, clinically important benefits from CEA were noted only in patients randomized within two weeks of their last event.</p><p/><p>Further analysis of the pooled NASCET and ECST data showed the following additional observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decline in benefit of CEA over time was more rapid in women than in men</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical benefit in women was confined to those who had CEA within two weeks after their last event, irrespective of the degree of stenosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CEA within two weeks of a nondisabling hemispheric stroke was not associated with an increased operative risk</p><p/><p>A 2009 systematic review identified 47 nonrandomized studies of CEA for recently symptomatic carotid stenosis that reported data on time from presenting event to CEA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In neurologically stable patients with recent TIA or nondisabling stroke, there was no significant difference in the rate of perioperative stroke or death with early CEA (within the first two weeks) compared with later CEA (odds ratio [OR] 1.2, 95% CI 0.9-1.6).

Given that there have been no prospective trials addressing the question of timing of surgery, it is difficult to generalize observations from the NASCET and ECST trials to all patients undergoing CEA.

Since the completion of these trials, newer medical regimens have emerged that reduce the risk of stroke. These therapies include aggressive treatment with statins, antiplatelet agents, and antihypertensive agents.
