The term &quot;carcinoid&quot; usually implies a well-differentiated histology and is rarely used to describe high-grade or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine cancers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system#H440387068\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology classification, and grading of neuroendocrine neoplasms arising in the digestive system&quot;, section on 'Pathology, tumor classification, and nomenclature'</a>.)</p><p>Carcinoid syndrome is the term applied to a constellation of symptoms that are mediated by various hormones that are secreted by some carcinoid tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F79329\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79329 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Two of the most common manifestations are flushing and diarrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63079\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63079 \">table 2</a>). Symptoms are associated with elevations in serum serotonin or its metabolite urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of the carcinoid syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Carcinoid crisis is a life-threatening form of carcinoid syndrome that results from the release of an overwhelming amount of biologically active compounds from the tumor that may be triggered by tumor manipulation (biopsy or surgery) or by anesthesia.</p><p>More than 90 percent of patients with the carcinoid syndrome have metastatic disease, typically involving the liver, with primary tumors in the distal small intestine or proximal colon (midgut). Rare exceptions are bronchial and ovarian carcinoids, which can rarely release hormones directly into the systemic circulation, thereby producing symptoms without metastases. When it does occur, carcinoid syndrome associated with bronchial carcinoids is often atypical; episodes of flushing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diaphoresis may be accompanied by other symptoms, such as tremor, periorbital edema, lacrimation, salivation, and edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of the carcinoid syndrome&quot;, section on 'Lung NET variant syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>This topic provides an overview of treatment for patients with symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome. Diagnosis of the carcinoid syndrome, radiologic staging, tumor localization, histologic assessment of carcinoid tumors, and presentation, treatment, prognosis, and posttreatment surveillance of patients with localized and metastatic carcinoid are discussed in detail elsewhere.

It acts by binding to somatostatin receptors, which are expressed on the majority of carcinoid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Nearly 80 percent of carcinoid tumors express somatostatin receptors, as determined using somatostatin receptor-based diagnostic imaging with a radiolabeled form of the somatostatin analog <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a>&nbsp;(indium-111 [111-In] pentetreotide [OctreoScan]) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallium-ga-68-dotatate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gallium Ga-68 DOTATATE</a> positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/computed</span> tomography (CT). However, whether imaging with either of these modalities is necessary before a trial of somatostatin analog therapy for patients who are symptomatic from carcinoid syndrome is controversial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metastatic-well-differentiated-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-presentation-prognosis-imaging-and-biochemical-monitoring#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metastatic well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: Presentation, prognosis, imaging, and biochemical monitoring&quot;, section on 'Somatostatin receptor-based imaging techniques'</a>.)</p><p>Because the somatostatin analogs <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lanreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lanreotide</a> bind to somatostatin receptors on the tumor cells, they are highly effective at inhibiting the release of bioactive amines. Flushing and diarrhea are significantly improved in over 80 percent of patients with the carcinoid syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>A depot form of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> (Sandostatin LAR), which is administered intramuscularly on a monthly basis, has largely eliminated the need for patients to inject themselves daily with short-acting subcutaneous octreotide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Depot octreotide is typically initiated at a dose of 20 to 30 mg intramuscularly (IM) every four weeks. Unless patients are severely symptomatic, we generally initiate therapy with octreotide LAR rather than short-acting octreotide. </p><p>Gradual dose escalation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> LAR or supplementation with short-acting octreotide may be necessary for patients with refractory symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H624742803\" class=\"local\">'Management of refractory symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>A long-acting formulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lanreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lanreotide</a> (Somatuline Depot) is also available for monthly injections at doses ranging from 60 to 120 mg every four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Lanreotide appears to have similar clinical efficacy and tolerability as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> for treatment of the carcinoid syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome/abstract/7-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-14</a>]. In a randomized phase III trial of depot lanreotide versus placebo in patients with carcinoid syndrome, lanreotide significantly reduced the need for short-acting somatostatin analog injections compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lanreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lanreotide</a> are usually well tolerated. Rarely, patients may develop nausea, abdominal discomfort, bloating <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> steatorrhea, often during the first several weeks of therapy, after which the symptoms subside. Pancreatic malabsorption may be a contributing factor, which can be alleviated with pancreatic enzyme supplementation. Another effect of somatostatin analogs is inhibition of gallbladder contractility, which can lead to gallstones or sludge. For that reason, a prophylactic cholecystectomy is sometimes recommended for patients who are undergoing abdominal surgery for other reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H945119\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiproliferative effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The somatostatin analogs <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lanreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lanreotide</a> were initially developed for control of the carcinoid syndrome. Both drugs have also been proven to inhibit tumor growth in randomized phase III trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

Among patients undergoing complete resection, long-term disease-free survival is reported in up to 20 percent of patients, and hepatic resection can also provide symptomatic relief in patients who are symptomatic from tumor bulk or the carcinoid syndrome. Preoperative and intraoperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> therapy are essential to protect against carcinoid crises that can arise from anaesthesia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tumor manipulation. (See <a href=\"#H624742810\" class=\"local\">'Prevention and management of carcinoid crisis'</a> below.)</p><p>More controversial is the value of cytoreductive hepatic surgery in patients with more advanced disease. Advocates of this approach cite numerous retrospective series reporting palliation of symptoms and prolonged survival durations among patients undergoing surgical tumor debulking. However, the lack of randomized, controlled studies precludes any definitive conclusions regarding the benefits of cytoreductive surgery. When it is performed in this setting, hepatic resections are generally restricted to patients in whom 90 percent or more of the disease bulk can be successfully resected or ablated. These issues are all addressed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metastatic-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-local-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion#H691406\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: Local options to control tumor growth and symptoms of hormone hypersecretion&quot;, section on 'Surgical resection'</a>.)</p><p>Hepatic transarterial embolizations are often performed for patients with surgically unresectable liver-predominant metastases. In patients with widespread hepatic metastatic neuroendocrine tumors, the embolizations are often lobar rather than highly selective. Embolization of the entire liver can be undertaken for patients with bilobar disease but is typically performed in two to three separate procedures. In uncontrolled trials, up to 75 percent of patients with carcinoid hepatic metastases have marked symptomatic improvement in flushing and diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. Embolizations can be performed using microparticles alone (bland embolization) or with admixed chemotherapy (chemoembolization). There is no evidence that chemoembolization results in superior outcomes compared with bland embolization, particularly in the treatment of midgut carcinoid metastases, which are generally chemoresistant. Short-term side effects of liver embolization include abdominal pain, fever, <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting,</span> and fatigue. Patients with the carcinoid syndrome should receive prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> pre- and postembolization in order to reduce risk of carcinoid crisis.</p><p>Experience with radioembolization using yttrium-90 (<sup>90</sup>Y)-labeled resin or glass microspheres is limited but growing. Radioembolization using <sup>90</sup>Y-labeled resin or glass microspheres reduces symptoms in approximately one-half of patients with functioning neuroendocrine tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. However, in the absence of randomized trials, it is difficult to know when to choose this technique over other embolization techniques. In particular, the risk of long-term radioembolization-induced liver disease (REILD) has not been well-characterized.

For example, patients who experience exacerbation of symptoms towards the end of a four-week treatment cycle may achieve palliation with increased frequency of administration (ie, every three weeks). Likewise, higher doses of depot-octreotide (up to 60 mg monthly) may be administered for patients with refractory symptoms. Doses exceeding 60 mg are unlikely to be of additional palliative benefit given saturation of somatostatin receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Another option for patients with breakthrough symptoms is use of supplemental doses of short-acting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> (ranging from 100 to 500 mcg every eight hours) on an &quot;as needed&quot; basis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H153891696\"><span class=\"h2\">Telotristat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The carcinoid syndrome is thought to be caused in large part by secretion of serotonin. A rate-limiting step in the conversion of the amino acid tryptophan to serotonin is mediated by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51368\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51368 \">figure 1</a>). An oral tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telotristat-ethyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telotristat</a> ethyl, has recently been approved in the United States for use in combination with somatostatin analog therapy in order to control diarrhea associated with the carcinoid syndrome. Approval was based on the following data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an initial, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 23 patients with inadequately controlled carcinoid syndrome receiving a long-acting somatostatin analog (18 randomized to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telotristat-ethyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telotristat</a> and five to placebo), treatment with telotristat was associated with a significant decrease in bowel movement frequency and significant decreases in urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benefit was confirmed in a larger randomized trial (the <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01677910?term=Telestar&rank=1&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPPxhoOZyNqfWlqF4haapN66l2pJ4Lyx3SH/JTgrCTaq3mC3qTeS6EgH2yU9rVWyKY8=&amp;TOPIC_ID=16638\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">TELESTAR trial</a>, a three-arm study evaluating two doses of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telotristat-ethyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telotristat</a> [250 mg and 500 mg, each taken three times daily] against placebo over a 12-week period) that was conducted in 135 patients with history of carcinoid syndrome who were receiving treatment with a somatostatin analog and who had uncontrolled diarrhea (&ge;4 bowel movements daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Treatment with telotristat at either dose was associated with a statistically significant reduction in bowel movement frequency over time compared with placebo. At week 12, the arithmetic mean reduction in daily bowel movement frequency from baseline was -1.7 and -2.1 with telotristat 250 and 500 mg, respectively, compared with -0.9 for placebo. Urinary 5-HIAA (a metabolite of serotonin) was also significantly decreased with telotristat; by week 12, arithmetic mean urinary 5-HIAA levels decreased by 40 and 57.7 mg per 24 hours with telotristat 250 and 500 mg, respectively, while levels increased in the placebo group by 11.5 mg per 24 hours in this same time period. Too few patients had flushing or abdominal discomfort to ascertain changes in these endpoints. Overall, the drug was well tolerated. There was a higher incidence of nausea with the 500 mg dose of telotristat as compared with either the lower 250 mg dose or placebo (31 versus 13 and 11 percent, respectively), and depression-related adverse events were also more frequent at the higher dose (16 versus 7 percent each for the telotristat 250 mg and placebo groups, respectively). </p><p/><p>Largely based upon these results, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telotristat-ethyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telotristat</a> has been approved in the United States in combination with somatostatin analog therapy for the treatment of adults with diarrhea related to carcinoid syndrome that is inadequately controlled by somatostatin analog therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

On the other hand, carcinoid heart disease is thought to be directly related to high levels of circulating serotonin. Although evidence of inhibition of carcinoid heart disease with telotristat is purely anecdotal at this time, use of the drug in patients with early evidence of carcinoid heart disease and high levels of circulating serotonin is reasonable, even if their diarrhea is otherwise controlled.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H945210\"><span class=\"h2\">Interferon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another option for control of refractory symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome in patients treated with somatostatin analogs is interferon alfa (IFNa) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Interferons can exert antitumor effects via stimulation of T cells, induction of cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of angiogenesis.</p><p>In retrospective series, low-dose IFNa alone (ie, 3 to 5 million units up to three to five times weekly) reduces symptoms of hormonal hypersecretion (flushing, diarrhea) in 40 to 50 percent of patients who are refractory to somatostatin analogs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

High circulating concentrations of serotonin are thought to be the major underlying factor. Among patients with the carcinoid syndrome, individuals with carcinoid heart disease exhibit higher levels of serum serotonin and urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) excretion than do those without heart disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carcinoid-heart-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carcinoid heart disease&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>Carcinoid heart lesions are characterized by plaque-like fibrous endocardial thickening that classically involves the right side of the heart, and often causes retraction and fixation of the leaflets of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77192\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77192 \">picture 1</a>). Tricuspid regurgitation is a nearly universal finding; tricuspid stenosis, pulmonary regurgitation, and pulmonary stenosis may also occur. The resulting right-sided heart failure produces significant morbidity and mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carcinoid-heart-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carcinoid heart disease&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Left-sided heart disease, which occurs in less than 10 percent of patients, is almost always associated with an atrial right-to-left shunt (as with a patent foramen ovale) or a primary bronchial carcinoid. This permits serotonin-rich blood to enter the left heart chambers without passing through the pulmonary capillaries.</p><p>Because evidence suggests a pathogenic role for serotonin or one of its metabolites in the development of carcinoid heart disease, it is likely that somatostatin analogs and other therapies that reduce circulating serotonin levels can reduce the risk of developing carcinoid heart disease, and they may inhibit progression of existing disease. However, there is no evidence that medical therapy can reverse valvular damage.

Echocardiograms should also be performed prior to surgery in patients with carcinoid syndrome.</p><p>Guidelines for screening for carcinoid heart disease in at-risk patients without valvular heart disease or heart failure are evolving, with differing recommendations in various major society guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. For most patients with carcinoid syndrome, we suggest periodic echocardiography, although the optimal frequency is not established. Another alternative is monitoring of serum levels of N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP).
