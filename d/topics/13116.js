Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs), defined as epithelial neoplasms with predominant neuroendocrine differentiation, can arise in most organs. While some clinical and pathologic features of these tumors are unique to the site of origin, other characteristics are shared regardless of site. </p><p>The classification and nomenclature of NENs are complex and confusing, in part because most studies have focused on tumors arising in a specific organ system. Site-specific proposals for nomenclature and classification differ in terminology and in the criteria for histologic grading and staging, and this has led to morphologically similar NENs being designated differently depending on the site of origin. For now, there is no one single system of nomenclature, grading, or staging that is suitable for NENs at all anatomic sites. However, features such as the proliferative rate of the tumor and the extent of local spread are shared by most classification systems.</p><p>NENs of the digestive system arising in the tubular gastrointestinal tract and the pancreas are relatively rare. The annual incidence in the United States is approximately 3.65 per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Although carcinoid tumors and pancreatic NETs may have similar characteristics on routine histologic evaluation, they have a different pathogenesis and biology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) are high-grade carcinomas that resemble small cell or large cell NEC of the lung (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74630\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74630 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Although in some circumstances they can be challenging to distinguish, these two groups of NENs are not thought to be closely related at a histogenetic or molecular level, and progression from NETs to NECs does not generally occur. In the current system, there is no conceptual category of moderately differentiated GEP NEN; NETs designated as such in the past are now considered part of the well-differentiated family.</p><p>This topic review will cover the pathology, classification, and histologic grading of GEP NENs, with an emphasis on well-differentiated NETs. The pathology of NETs arising in the lungs is discussed elsewhere, as is poorly differentiated GEP NEC.

The cut surface appears red to tan, reflecting the abundant microvasculature, or sometimes yellow because of high lipid content (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74672\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74672 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F68174\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68174 \">picture 3</a>). Morphologically, well-differentiated NETs have characteristic &quot;organoid&quot; arrangements of tumor cells, with <span class=\"nowrap\">solid/nesting,</span> trabecular, gyriform, or sometimes, glandular patterns. The cells are relatively uniform, and they have round to oval nuclei, coarsely stippled chromatin, and finely granular cytoplasm. </p><p>The cells produce abundant neurosecretory granules, as reflected in the strong and diffuse immunohistochemical expression of neuroendocrine markers such as synaptophysin and chromogranin. In addition, some tumors may secrete specific peptide hormones or bioamines (such as insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide [VIP], serotonin, gastrin, etc), which may produce clinically evident hormonal syndromes. (See <a href=\"#H799428\" class=\"local\">'Functionality and nomenclature'</a> below.)</p><p>Generally, the histologic features of the tumor do not correlate with anatomic location or hormone production, but there are exceptions: amyloid deposition (insulin-associated peptide) often indicates an insulin-secreting pancreatic NET, and a glandular architecture with abundant psammoma body formation is usually seen in duodenal or ampullary somatostatin-secreting NETs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F75073\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75073 \">picture 4</a>). Well-differentiated NETs of the midgut (ileum in particular) also have a very characteristic pattern of solid or cribriform nests punctuated by sharply outlined luminal spaces with peripheral nuclear palisading and granular eosinophilic cytoplasm.</p><p>Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) less closely resemble nonneoplastic neuroendocrine cells and have a more sheet-like or diffuse architecture, irregular nuclei, and less cytoplasmic granularity. Immunohistochemical expression of neuroendocrine markers is generally more limited in extent and intensity.

Furthermore, terminology continues to evolve with the 2017 WHO classification of endocrine tumors of the pancreas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F116294\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116294 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2474956\" class=\"local\">'2010 WHO classification and 2017 update'</a> below.) </p><p>Classification based upon morphology alone is not very useful, particularly for well-differentiated tumors, because histologic features do not accurately predict an indolent or aggressive clinical course. Although nuclear pleomorphism often correlates with differentiation (ie, the extent to which the neoplastic cells resemble their normal, nonneoplastic counterparts) and malignant behavior in other tumor types, it is of little use in NENs. Until recently, it was held that the only unequivocal evidence of malignancy was the presence of local invasion or metastasis, but currently, well-differentiated NETs are all considered to have malignant potential, with a risk stratification approach being used to predict prognosis. </p><p>Traditionally, GEP NENs were referred to as carcinoid tumors or pancreatic NETs (islet cell tumors). The term &quot;carcinoid&quot; has been criticized because it does not convey the potential for malignant behavior that accompanies these neoplasms. Nevertheless, this term remains in widespread use, both in the official WHO classification of NETs of the lung and as a synonym for well-differentiated NETs arising in the tubular gastrointestinal tract.

NETs were classified into four groups (I to IV), mainly based upon size and angioinvasion: benign, benign or low-grade malignant, low-grade malignant, and high-grade malignant. The prognostic value of this revised classification was subsequently validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other features were later shown to correlate with malignant behavior, including perineural and capsular invasion, high mitotic index, and tumor necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In 1997, it was suggested that pancreatic NETs could be separated into prognostically different groups based upon tumor size and mitotic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Efforts to refine prognosis culminated in the WHO classification of NENs for the tubular gastrointestinal tract in 2000 and the pancreas in 2004, which were essentially modified versions of the Capella classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Based upon a combination of tumor size, vascular and perineural invasion, proliferative activity, local invasion, and lymph node and distant metastases, NENs were separated into well-differentiated NETs with benign behavior, well-differentiated NETs with uncertain behavior, well-differentiated NECs, and poorly differentiated NECs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The prognostic value of this system was subsequently validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>], but it was slow to gain acceptance in the United States due to its complexity and several shortcomings that emerged:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">2000/2004</span> WHO classifications used a hybrid of grading (the inherent biologic aggressiveness of the tumors as assessed by histologic features such as mitotic activity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Ki-67 labeling index) and staging (disease extent as measured by tumor size, invasion, and metastasis) features.

This grading proposal was later jointly endorsed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) for the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging classification of digestive system NENs, although they modified the staging parameters of the ENETS proposal. (See <a href=\"#H13525387\" class=\"local\">'Staging system'</a> below.)</p><p>This histologic grading scheme uses proliferative rate only to stratify the grades and requires both a mitotic count and the Ki-67 labeling index to be measured. The higher of these two indices is used to define the final grade in cases where the mitotic rate and Ki-67 index are discordant. (See <a href=\"#H800190\" class=\"local\">'Choice of method'</a> below.)</p><p>The 2010 WHO classification of tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and pancreas (which was subsequently updated in 2017, see below) also endorsed the ENETS grading scheme for NENs of the digestive tract, separating well-differentiated tumors into low-grade (G1) and intermediate-grade (G2) categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60365\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60365 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. All poorly differentiated NETs are high-grade (G3) NECs according to this classification scheme.</p><p>NENs of unknown primary, especially the well-differentiated ones, often present initially with liver metastases, and most of these represent GEP NETs. Thus, the 2010 WHO grading scheme also applies to this category unless a different primary site is found. In this setting, histologic grade is particularly important since NENs of unknown primary are, by definition, metastatic disease and therefore are considered stage IV in all TNM staging systems (see below). </p><p>Histologic grade may be the only prognostic parameter available for this group of tumors.

There are small cell and large cell variants. For poorly differentiated NECs, the morphologic features often suggest the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24</a>].

Even without an in-depth assessment, the high mitotic rate and Ki-67 labeling index are usually readily apparent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F75073\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75073 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p>While these tumors are included in many published studies of NENs of the digestive system, they represent a distinct group, with clinical behavior similar to that of small cell carcinoma or large cell NEC of the lung, which is far worse than that of well-differentiated NETs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. In the largest series of poorly differentiated pancreatic NEC, 88 percent of the patients had lymph node or distant metastatic disease at presentation, and an additional 7 percent developed metastases subsequently. The median survival was 11 months (range 0 to 104 months), and the two- and five-year survival rates were 22.5 and 16.1 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

If the neoplasm consists of a neuroendocrine component and a gland-forming component, both exceeding 30 percent, the new 2017 WHO classification defines it as a mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasm (MiNEN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/2,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,28</a>]. The earlier 2010 WHO classification of tumors of the digestive tract referred to these tumors as mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Evidence of progression can be demonstrated by an increase in the proliferative rate, and in some cases, there is also a change in tumor morphology, an increase in nuclear atypia, or development of significant necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Interestingly, the underlying genomic alterations persist in the higher-grade foci, and the specific mutations that are typical of poorly differentiated NEC, such as <em>RB1</em> and <em>TP53</em>, are not found in well-differentiated G3 NETs. Progression from NET to NEC does not generally occur. </p><p>These data support the view that the 2010 WHO G3 category of NENs is in fact heterogeneous, containing two distinct groups of neoplasms, and can be further separated into well-differentiated NETs with an elevated proliferation rate and poorly differentiated NECs. Furthermore, the presence of a cohort of neoplasms with a lower Ki-67 index (20 to 55 percent) within the cohort of G3 NECs, which respond less well to platinum-based chemotherapy but survive longer than those with a Ki-67 &gt;55 percent, adds further support to the heterogeneity of the 2010 WHO G3 category [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/1,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25</a>].

The specific terminology for pancreatic NENs now includes the well-differentiated G3 NET group (PanNET G3) as distinct from poorly differentiated NEC (PanNEC G3) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F115945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115945 \">table 4</a>); However, this change currently applies only to pancreatic NENs, and tumors that arise in the tubular portion of the gastrointestinal tract are still graded according to the 2010 classification, which will not be updated until 2018. Others use the term &quot;NET G3&quot; to refer to G3 well-differentiated NENs regardless of site of origin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-grade-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High-grade gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Histologically, when a pathologist is assessing a G3 pancreatic NEN, the aforementioned morphological features may not always be reliable in separating PanNET G3 from PanNEC G3. Furthermore, there is no Ki-67 index cutoff within the G3 range (&gt;20 percent) that sharply separates these two neoplasms; an extremely high Ki-67 (&gt;75 percent) usually points to a PanNEC G3, but rates in the 20 to 55 percent range can be seen with either PanNET G3 or PanNEC G3 tumors. A mitotic rate greater than 20 per 10 HPF usually indicates a PanNEC G3 tumor, since most PanNET G3 cases fall into the G3 range solely based on Ki-67 index. </p><p>A prior diagnosis of well-differentiated NET or a focal area of well-differentiated NET elsewhere within a neoplasm supports a diagnosis of PanNET G3, while a history of or combination with adenocarcinoma supports a diagnosis of PanNEC G3. In difficult cases, immunohistochemical staining may be helpful. For example, PanNET G3 show loss of DAXX and ATRX in roughly one-half of cases, similar to PanNET G1 and G2 tumors, whereas loss of Rb or abnormality in p53 expression supports a diagnosis of PanNEC G3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13525387\"><span class=\"h3\">Staging system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The WHO has also endorsed staging NENs using the TNM staging system.

Functioning NETs are defined based upon the presence of clinical symptoms due to excess hormone secretion by the tumor. Functioning (hormone-secreting) pancreatic NETs are classified according to the predominant hormone they secrete and the resulting clinical syndrome (eg, insulinoma, gastrinoma, glucagonoma, VIPoma, somatostatinoma) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69622\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69622 \">table 11</a>). Immunohistochemical staining is not a defining criterion for tumor classification. For example, if a tumor stains for gastrin but does not produce symptoms of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, it should not be considered a gastrinoma; however, &quot;gastrin-secreting NET&quot; would be an appropriate term. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of the carcinoid syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagonoma-and-the-glucagonoma-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucagonoma and the glucagonoma syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vipoma-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;VIPoma: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=somatostatinoma-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Somatostatinoma: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although functionality may impact prognosis (eg, insulinomas are generally indolent tumors), the biologic behavior of most functioning NETs is defined by the grade and stage of the tumor. Thus, the pathologic diagnosis of a functioning pancreatic NET should be the same as for a nonfunctioning NET, with the descriptive functional designation appended to the diagnosis when there is knowledge of a clinical syndrome. NETs of the tubular gastrointestinal tract (carcinoid tumors) are classified similarly whether they produce symptoms of carcinoid syndrome or not.

It is recommended that only clear-cut mitotic figures be counted, excluding degenerating dark-stained nuclei and apoptotic bodies. </p><p>In addition, the size of the microscopic field matters tremendously; the size of 10 HPF is set to 2 mm<sup>2</sup> for standardization. For the microscopes used in earlier studies, the size of 10 HPF (using a 40x objective) roughly equals 2 mm<sup>2</sup>; however, the size of the fields has not been standardized between different brands of microscopes, a fact that has not been considered in some studies. As illustrated in the original study of pulmonary carcinoid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], the 40x field of the Olympus BX40 microscope (which is commonly used by pathologists) with a standard <span class=\"nowrap\">10X/22</span> eyepiece has an area of 0.24 mm<sup>2</sup>, thus only 8.3 HPFs are needed to view a 2 mm<sup>2</sup> area. If one counts 10 HPFs with this microscope, one will actually view 2.4 mm<sup>2</sup>, 20 percent more than intended, thus potentially overestimating the grade.</p><p>The European Neuroendocrine Tumour Society (ENETS) and WHO recommend counting 40 to 50 mitotically active HPFs to obtain an average count; however, this does not completely eliminate the above problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/19,20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20,22</a>]. In addition, identification of mitotic &quot;hot spots&quot; on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained sections is very difficult, if not impossible. In a study investigating the utility of a mitosis-specific antibody, anti-phosphohistone H3 (PHH3), to assist in the histologic grading of well-differentiated NETs in the pancreas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], mitotic count as assessed by PHH3 immunostaining was less time consuming than with H&amp;E-stained sections, with much improved interobserver reproducibility. More importantly, histologic grading based upon mitotic count by PHH3 immunostaining correlated well with both disease-specific survival and disease-free survival. A major benefit of immunostaining is that it is possible to quickly identify the mitotic &quot;hot spot,&quot; and the same study also showed that histologic grade based upon mitotic rate in a single hot spot field correlated with patient survival as well. Thus, mitotic rate can potentially be determined by counting one hot spot, which will greatly facilitate the assessment of histologic grade in pancreatic well-differentiated NETs. It should be noted that the mitotic cutoff to separate low-grade from high-grade NETs by PHH3 immunostaining (&ge;4 mitoses per 10 HPF [2 mm<sup>2</sup>], &ge;7 mitoses per 10&times; hot spot, and &ge;5 mitoses per 20&times; hot spot) was slightly higher than that on H&amp;E, which is not surprising considering the higher sensitivity of immunostaining and the easier identification of mitotic hot spots [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Other factors that add variability to mitotic counting include variable section thickness, variability in tumor <span class=\"nowrap\">cellularity/stromal</span> ratio, and variations in tumor cell size. Although NET cells are generally small and uniform with round nuclei and moderate cytoplasm, there is great variability in cell size between tumors. Some tumor cells have more abundant cytoplasm, and in tumors with ribbon-like or glandular patterns, there is more tumor-free space in a microscopic field (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F75073\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75073 \">picture 4</a>). In addition, stromal fibrosis is common in NETs and can be extensive, limiting the proportion of the tumor that contains neoplastic cells. For these reasons, simply counting 10 HPFs or 2 mm<sup>2</sup> does not mean we are evaluating the same number of tumor cells.</p><p>It has been hypothesized that it would be more accurate to count a certain number of cells, as for Ki-67 labeling index (see <a href=\"#H440387082\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of Ki-67 labeling index'</a> below), and to express the mitotic rate as a percentage of neoplastic cells. This approach was also tested with PHH3 immunostaining and was found to have less prognostic value than counting the number of mitoses in a certain number of microscopic fields [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H440387082\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of Ki-67 labeling index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal cutoff values for the Ki-67 labeling index to distinguish low-, intermediate-, and high-grade GEP NENs have not been conclusively established and may vary depending upon the primary site of the neoplasm. However, ENETS, AJCC, and both the 2010 and 2017 WHO classifications include a uniform Ki-67 labeling cutoff of &lt;3 percent to define low-grade, 3 to 20 percent for intermediate-grade, and &gt;20 percent for high-grade NENs of both the tubular gastrointestinal tract (at all sites) and pancreas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111125\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111125 \">table 12</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/2,22,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,22,52</a>]. Assignment of grade based upon these Ki-67 cutoffs has been shown to correlate with patient survival independent of tumor stage in both primary and metastatic GEP NETs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/38-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-43</a>].</p><p>The Ki-67 protein is a large nuclear protein (395 kDa) that is closely associated with the nucleolus and heterochromatin.

The choice of cutoff may be influenced by the measures of patient outcome (dead versus alive, recurrence versus no recurrence, disease-specific survival, disease-free survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], etc) and the investigator's interpretation of its clinical significance.

It appears that the Ki-67 cutoff for low grade versus intermediate grade lies between 2 and 10 percent, and the best cutoff depends on a number of factors, including the study cohorts, the outcome measure, and the observers. For practical purposes, any cutoff in that range may confer prognostic significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of a 3 percent cutoff point to stratify prognosis among well-differentiated pancreatic NETs is supported by subsequent studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-43</a>], and most groups, including ENETS, <span class=\"nowrap\">AJCC/UICC,</span> and WHO, use a uniform cutoff of &lt;3 percent to define low-grade versus intermediate-grade NETs of the digestive tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111125\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111125 \">table 12</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/2,22,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,22,52</a>].

A clinical study of WHO high-grade gastrointestinal NECs found that patients with a Ki-67 &lt;55 percent had a lower response rate to platinum-based chemotherapy (15 versus 42 percent, p &lt;0.001) but better survival (14 versus 10 months, p &lt;0.001) than did those patients with a Ki-67 &ge;55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Alternatively, some pathologists choose to estimate the labeling index by scanning the slide or &quot;eyeballing.&quot; Eyeballing may be sufficient to separate low- to intermediate-grade from high-grade tumors (ie, Ki-67 1 to 20 versus &gt;50 percent), but this approach has been criticized due to a lack of precision and reproducibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>When either manual counting or eyeballing is used for research studies, issues of intraobserver <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> interobserver variability necessitate some sort of statistical confirmation (eg, the Bland-Altman approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]) to ensure that intraobserver variability is within an acceptable range. Digital image analysis has been validated for the assessment of nuclear markers, with much less variability than manual counting or eyeballing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/43,63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,63-65</a>], thus avoiding the need for complicated statistical analyses for reproducibility. Particularly because of the anticipated wide utilization of digital slides in the near future, image analysis can be easily incorporated into the analytic software, and a Ki-67 labeling index is thus generated automatically. However, digital image analysis also carries its own drawbacks. The inclusion of areas with necrosis, hemorrhage, fibrosis, nonneoplastic tissue, or high background labeling in the analysis may lead to misleading results. For instance, nonneoplastic lymphocytes within a tumor often label for Ki-67, and measuring a region with significant lymphocytes can grossly overestimate the Ki-67 index. This problem may be mitigated by human intervention, software improvement, and laboratory standardization; however, these issues will increase the time needed to perform accurate digital quantification.</p><p>Studies assessing the time required to calculate an accurate Ki-67 index have concluded that with currently available morphometric algorithms, the optimal method is to print a photograph of the hot spot region and manually count the Ki-67 positive cells, using the photograph to tick off each cell as it is counted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H800190\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of method</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best method (mitotic counting versus Ki-67 labeling index) to establish the proliferative rate is not established.

In a limited specimen, such as liver biopsy, gastrointestinal biopsy, or fine needle aspiration of the pancreas, there may be only a few HPFs available, much less than the 40 to 50 HPFs required for accurate mitotic counting, and accurate determination of mitotic rate is difficult in those cases. However, 500 to 2000 cells are generally present even in those limited specimens, from which a Ki-67 index can be comfortably obtained. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the advent of the digital era, Ki-67 labeling index has the potential of at least partial automation, thus eliminating the tedious work of counting a certain number of cells or HPFs.

A common practice is to use mitotic counting for grading in resection specimens and to use the Ki-67 labeling index for more limited material, but this approach does not allow formal grading based on the WHO and AJCC criteria. Including the mitotic count can be helpful to distinguish poorly differentiated NECs from high-grade well-differentiated NETs since the latter rarely have a mitotic rate in the high-grade range (ie, they are grade discordant, see above). For optimal grading and better guidance for chemotherapy, it may be necessary to do both. </p><p>The Ki-67 labeling index generally correlates with the mitotic count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/42,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,58</a>]; however, there may be discrepancies. The Ki-67 protein has a short half-life, and its amount and localization change with the cell cycle, which may explain the rare discrepancies observed by some authors. In cases with discordance between these two measures of proliferation, the WHO classification recommends using the higher grade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], which was validated in a study of discordant <span class=\"nowrap\">low-grade/intermediate-grade</span> NETs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. As noted above, the WHO &quot;PanNET G3&quot; category of pancreatic NENs is also grade discordant in most, if not all, cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Within the <span class=\"nowrap\">ENETS/WHO</span> classification system, it is recommended that at least 40 HPFs should be counted for mitoses and that areas of highest labeling (&quot;hot spots&quot;) should be used to determine the Ki-67 labeling index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/19,20,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20,67</a>].</p><p>If Ki-67 staining is performed on a large specimen, such as a resection, it is relatively simple to scan the tumor at low power to identify the hot spots of greatest labeling.

Furthermore, there are few data addressing whether the proliferative rate within hot spot areas more accurately predicts prognosis than, for example, the average proliferative rate in the entire tumor.</p><p>This issue has been addressed in at least two studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study that used tissue microarrays to assess prognostic markers in biopsies from pancreatic NET liver metastases, there was good correlation between the Ki-67 labeling indices in two random cores taken from a single metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].
