The reason for the wide variability is that the diagnosis is made only by biopsy, and the indications for biopsy vary between transplant centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Centers that perform protocol biopsies in the absence of symptoms generally report a higher incidence. The best data are from one study of 19 patients with MN who underwent surveillance biopsies after transplantation, of which recurrent MN was detected in eight (42 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Initial reports suggested that patients with living, related transplants are at higher risk for recurrence than those who receive deceased-donor grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>]. However, this has not been confirmed by larger studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. In one study of 35 patients with MN who received a kidney allograft between 1975 and 2008, 12 patients (34 percent) developed recurrent MN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Although the rate of recurrence was modestly higher among patients who had a living, related transplant compared with those who received a deceased-donor allograft (4 of 8, or 50 percent, versus 8 of 27, or 30 percent, respectively), the difference was not significant. Two other series that included a total of 53 patients were also unable to confirm a higher risk associated with living, related transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>No other traditional risk factors for recurrence have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H150994\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of idiopathic MN is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of membranous nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>The occasionally rapid recurrence of MN following transplantation suggests the presence of a circulating factor that may be present at the time of transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This factor could be an autoantibody to the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R), which has been implicated in MN pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Autoantibodies against PLA2R have been reported in patients with recurrent MN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. In one such patient, who developed recurrent disease 13 days after transplantation, PLA2R and monotypic IgG3 were colocalized in glomerular deposits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This patient was also shown to have circulating anti-PLA2R antibodies of the same immunoglobulin G 3 (IgG3) kappa subclass that was present in glomerular deposits of both the native kidney and the allograft, strongly suggesting that this antibody caused the glomerular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Several studies have identified circulating anti-PLA2R antibodies at or after the time of kidney transplantation as a risk factor for the development of recurrent MN. A positive test and high titers of anti-PLA2R antibodies at the time of transplantation are associated with an increased risk of recurrent MN with a positive predictive value greater than 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. The disappearance of anti-PLA2R antibodies with maintenance transplant immunosuppression or after specific treatment of recurrent MN results in clinical improvement with resolution of proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>]. The persistence or reappearance of anti-PLA2R after kidney transplantation predicts a worsening clinical course of recurrent MN with increasing proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>]. Thus, testing for anti-PLA2R antibodies at the time of kidney transplantation and serial monitoring of the antibody levels after transplantation might help the clinician to identify patients who need further intervention with either increasing maintenance immunosuppression or other drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>).</p><p>The treatment of recurrent MN with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> was associated with a reduction in the level of anti-PLA2R and a decrease in proteinuria, suggesting a link between the autoantibody level and disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of membranous nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Phospholipase A2 receptor'</a>.)</p><p>Other autoantibodies, such as those to thrombospondin type-1 domain-containing 7A (THSD7A) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], have been identified in patients with primary MN, but not recurrent MN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of membranous nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H152029\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical manifestations of recurrent MN are typically observed 13 to 15 months after transplantation, although they may be observed much earlier (within weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/8,9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,11</a>]. The most common clinical manifestation is proteinuria, the degree of which may vary on presentation. In one study of 15 patients with recurrent MN, 12 (80 percent) had protein excretion greater than 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours (or a protein-to-creatinine ratio greater than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/g),</span> with eight having nephrotic-range proteinuria (ie, greater than 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Protein excretion may be lower among those with recurrent MN detected by protocol biopsy and without overt signs or symptoms of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In one study of eight patients with recurrent MN diagnosed by surveillance biopsies, three had normal protein excretion, and five had protein excretion greater than 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> but less than 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> at the time of biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Progression of proteinuria is common even among patients with mild or no proteinuria on presentation. As an example, in the study cited above, of seven patients who did not receive additional immunosuppression for recurrent MN, five had significant increases in protein excretion, and three developed nephrotic-range proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In another study, among 29 patients, the median proteinuria increased from 331 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> at diagnosis to 1409 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> during a mean of 19 months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Glomerular filtration is often normal or only mildly decreased on initial presentation. In the study cited above of 15 patients with recurrent MN, there was no significant difference in serum creatinine at the time of diagnosis compared with patients who did not have recurrent MN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) often falls with progression of disease. (See <a href=\"#H151472\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28935116\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent MN is suspected in the transplant patient who develops new and progressive proteinuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an elevated serum creatinine level. Indications for biopsy vary among transplant centers. We generally perform a biopsy in all transplant recipients with a history of MN who develop any persistent increase in protein excretion above baseline. The diagnosis of recurrent MN is made by classic findings of MN on renal biopsy. This is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-membranous-nephropathy#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of membranous nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The association of the PLA2R <span class=\"nowrap\">antigen/autoantibody</span> system in the majority of primary MN cases also holds true in recurrent MN. In one study, 50 percent (5 of 10) of recurrent MN cases were seropositive for anti-PLA2R, and all five stained positively for the PLA2R antigen within immune deposits on biopsy of the allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In another study, PLA2R staining within deposits had a sensitivity of 83 percent and a specificity of 92 percent for recurrent MN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Similar to findings in primary MN of the native kidney, IgG4 is the dominant or codominant IgG subclass in recurrent MN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. These associations may be helpful in distinguishing recurrent MN from de novo MN. (See <a href=\"#H26073579\" class=\"local\">'De novo membranous nephropathy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H151472\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent disease can lead to loss of the allograft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/5,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,30,31</a>]. Estimates of the incidence of graft loss due to recurrent MN are provided by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 81 renal transplant recipients with MN on biopsy of their native kidney, the incidence of allograft loss at 10 years due to recurrent disease was 12.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 28 kidney transplant patients, recurrent disease was associated with a 10 percent risk of death-censored graft loss over 50 months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H151899\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for recurrent MN includes non-immunosuppressive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunosuppressive therapies. Our approach varies based upon the degree of proteinuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> renal dysfunction:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with no or minimal protein excretion (ie, &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day),</span> stable GFR, and only histologic evidence of recurrent MN (as detected, for example, by protocol biopsy) are managed with non-immunosuppressive therapy alone. This primarily includes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy and rigorous blood pressure control. We do not treat such patients with immunosuppressive therapies. It should be noted that proteinuria may increase with duration of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], so frequent reassessment is necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with protein excretion &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a decreasing GFR are treated with both immunosuppressive and non-immunosuppressive therapy. We prefer the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> to the existing immunosuppressive regimen (with some modifications), rather than other immunosuppressive agents. Non-immunosuppressive therapy principally consists of ACE inhibitor therapy and blood pressure control. (See <a href=\"#H28935754\" class=\"local\">'Moderate to severe disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28935777\"><span class=\"h3\">Mild disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with minimal protein excretion (eg, less than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">gram/day),</span> stable renal function, and only histologic evidence of recurrent MN (as detected, for example, by protocol biopsy) have a reasonable prognosis if disease manifestations do not worsen over time. Such patients are only treated with non-immunosuppressive therapy. Augmenting maintenance immunosuppressive therapy cannot be justified in such patients, given the excellent prognosis in those in whom disease manifestations do not progress.</p><p>Non-immunosuppressive therapies for patients with recurrent, mild MN include angiotensin inhibition, rigorous blood pressure control, and control of hyperlipidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Support for these interventions is derived from studies of nontransplanted patients with idiopathic MN. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic membranous nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Nonimmunosuppressive therapies'</a>.)</p><p>No studies have conclusively demonstrated a benefit of angiotensin inhibition or good blood pressure control on the progression of recurrent MN in transplant recipients. In one small, observational study of seven patients with recurrent MN, tight blood pressure control (with target of <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;130/80</span> mmHg) and angiotensin inhibition did not prevent progression of proteinuria in six patients at 18 months, although GFR remained stable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The optimal target blood pressure for patients who have had a renal transplantation is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertension-after-renal-transplantation#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertension after renal transplantation&quot;, section on 'Definitions and goals of therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28935754\"><span class=\"h3\">Moderate to severe disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with protein excretion greater than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">gram/day</span> are given immunosuppressive therapy in addition to the non-immunosuppressive therapies described above. (See <a href=\"#H28935777\" class=\"local\">'Mild disease'</a> above.)</p><p>The rationale for this is based upon clinical experience as there are no well-designed studies to guide the approach to the initiation of therapy for recurrent MN. The approach to immunosuppressive treatment of recurrent MN in the transplanted patient is different from that of nontransplanted patients who develop MN. As an example, nontransplanted patients who develop MN and who have only mild or moderate proteinuria are often not given immunosuppressive therapies, because the rate of spontaneous remission is high. However, patients with recurrent MN are more likely to have aggressive disease since they have a history of end-stage renal disease due to MN and since MN recurs despite immunosuppressive therapy to prevent rejection. Thus, patients with recurrent MN are generally treated more aggressively than those who present with MN for the first time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-membranous-nephropathy#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic membranous nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Indications for and choice of therapy'</a>.)</p><p>We prefer the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> to the existing immunosuppressive regimen (with some modifications), rather than other immunosuppressive agents. Rituximab has been shown in limited studies to be effective for the treatment of recurrent MN. (See <a href=\"#H152356\" class=\"local\">'Rituximab'</a> below.)</p><p>Other immunosuppressive agents have not been shown to be effective. The standard doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil used for immunosuppression after transplantation do not seem to protect against or change the course of recurrent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>].
