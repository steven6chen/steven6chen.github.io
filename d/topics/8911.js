They work by reducing swelling (called &quot;inflammation&quot;) in your lungs.</p><p>Inhaled corticosteroids are also called &quot;preventer&quot; or &quot;controller&quot; inhalers. That's because they help prevent flares of shortness of breath and wheezing. You need to use them every day, even when you feel well.</p><p>Steroid medicines also come as pills, shots, nose sprays, or creams. These are discussed in separate articles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-steroid-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Oral steroid medicines (The Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-corticosteroid-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Topical corticosteroid medicines (The Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Inhaled corticosteroids are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally to build muscle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3297780633\"><span class=\"h1\">What are some common inhaled corticosteroids?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examples of inhaled corticosteroids include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">fluticasone</a> (sample brand name: Flovent), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beclomethasone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">beclomethasone</a> (sample brand name: QVAR), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">budesonide</a> (sample brand name: Pulmicort Flexhaler), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mometasone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">mometasone</a> (sample brand name: Asmanex).</p><p>Corticosteroid inhalers are sometimes combined with a medicine called a &quot;long-acting bronchodilator&quot; in the same inhaler. Long-acting bronchodilators help open the airways. Using a combination inhaler makes it easier to take both medicines together. Examples of combination inhalers include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluticasone-and-salmeterol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">fluticasone-salmeterol</a> (sample brand names: Advair Diskus, Advair HFA), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-and-formoterol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">budesonide-formoterol</a> (sample brand name: Symbicort), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=formoterol-and-mometasone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">formoterol-mometasone</a> (sample brand name: Dulera).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H427935261\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I use a corticosteroid inhaler?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two different types of corticosteroid inhalers:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Metered dose inhalers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61575\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61575 \">picture 1</a>) &ndash; Most metered dose inhalers spray medicine when you press down on the top of the canister. Some metered dose inhalers are meant to be used with a spacer. A spacer is a device that attaches to the inhaler's mouthpiece (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56533\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56533 \">picture 2</a>). When you press down on the canister, the medicine sprays into the spacer and sits there until you breathe it in. Your doctor or nurse will tell you if you should use a spacer with your corticosteroid inhaler.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry powder inhalers &ndash; These release medicine when you take a deep breath in from the inhaler.</p><p/><p>Most people take 1 or 2 puffs from their inhaler in the morning and 1 or 2 puffs in the evening. Inhaled corticosteroids can only work to prevent breathing problems if you use your inhaler <strong>every day</strong>, even when you are not having trouble breathing.</p><p>Each type of inhaler is used in a different way. Your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist will show you how to use the inhaler prescribed for you. There are separate patient education articles in UpToDate that have more information about each type of inhaler. These are listed at the end of this article.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1306581097\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the side effects of inhaled corticosteroids?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhaled corticosteroids usually have no side effects or only mild side effects when you use them correctly. Common side effects are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrush &ndash; This is a fungal infection that causes soreness and white patches in the mouth. To help prevent thrush, you can gargle and rinse your mouth with water after every time you use your inhaler. If you do get thrush, your doctor can prescribe a medicine to treat it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hoarse voice</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sore throat or mouth</p><p/><p>Some people who need high doses of inhaled corticosteroids for a long time can have other side effects. These can include increased appetite, bruising, infections, thinning or weakening of the bones, and slowed growth in children. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1245299528\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I know about inhaled corticosteroids?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These are some things to keep in mind:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A steroid inhaler helps prevent breathing problem flare ups. It does <strong>not</strong> relieve symptoms quickly. Your doctor will prescribe a different kind of inhaler to help quickly relieve breathing problems, such as asthma or COPD &quot;attacks.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It's important to keep using your steroid inhaler every day as your prescription says, even if you feel well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gargle and rinse your mouth with water and spit it out or brush your teeth after you use your steroid inhaler.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you are not sure how to use your inhaler or spacer correctly, talk to your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you are pregnant or want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor. Inhaled corticosteroids are usually considered safe to use during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but it's best to review this with your doctor first.</p><p/><p>For more detailed information about your medicines, ask your doctor or nurse for information from Lexicomp available through UpToDate. The Lexicomp handouts explain how to use and store your medicines. They also list possible side effects and warn you if your medicines should not be taken with certain other medicines or foods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4006764471\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-asthma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for asthma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-including-emphysema-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-metered-dose-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your metered dose inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-use-your-dry-powder-inhaler-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to use your dry powder inhaler (adults) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-treatment-in-adolescents-and-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma treatment in adolescents and adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-treatments-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatments (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-inhaler-techniques-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma inhaler techniques in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
