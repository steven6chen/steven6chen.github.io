Some skeletal dysplasias are associated with abnormalities in other organ systems.</p><p>These disorders begin to manifest in the early stages of fetal development. They can be due to extrinsic causes (eg, teratogen exposure, maternal autoimmune disorders) or intrinsic causes (single gene disorders with autosomal dominant, recessive, or X-linked modes of inheritance; imprinting errors or chromosome abnormalities) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In view of the large number of skeletal dysplasias (over 436 known types), a nosology and classification system was developed that categorizes genetic bone disorders into 42 major groups based on their cardinal features (eg, radiological findings, molecular etiology, inheritance) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>] to facilitate diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The lethal group of skeletal dysplasias typically has an earlier onset with more severe phenotypic features than the non-lethal group, thus lethal skeletal dysplasia are potentially more amenable to prenatal diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Diagnostic accuracy is critical, as it will significantly affect parental counseling and decision-making regarding continuation of the current pregnancy, as well as options for prenatal or preimplantation genetic diagnosis in future pregnancies. After birth, postnatal radiographs, autopsy (in lethal cases), and molecular testing are crucial for making an accurate diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/3,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,8</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss lethal skeletal dysplasias that present prenatally. The majority of skeletal dysplasias will present postnatally with obvious clinical manifestations. Postnatal evaluation, clinical findings, and diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skeletal-dysplasias-approach-to-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skeletal dysplasias: Approach to evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skeletal-dysplasias-specific-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skeletal dysplasias: Specific disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2348169\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although each type of skeletal dysplasia is rare, the overall birth prevalence of skeletal dysplasias is estimated to be 2.4 per 10,000 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/1,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,10</a>]. The prevalence during pregnancy appears to be slightly higher at 7.5 per 10,000 ultrasound-screened pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of lethal skeletal dysplasias ranges from 0.95 to 1.5 per 10,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/9,10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,12</a>]. The three most common lethal skeletal dysplasias are thanatophoric dysplasia (29 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], osteogenesis imperfect type 2 (14 percent), and achondrogenesis (9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], which account for 40 to 60 percent of all lethal skeletal dysplasias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/10,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15-17</a>]. Chondroectodermal dysplasia, campomelic dysplasia, and Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia are also among the more common lethal skeletal dysplasias, although it should be noted that this latter group is invariably lethal depending on the severity of phenotypic expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These figures from specific tertiary centers reflect the rate of consanguinity and the specific ethnic background of the population served by the tertiary center.</p><p>The overall frequency of perinatal deaths due to skeletal dysplasias is approximately 9 per 1000 births, with 23 percent stillborn and an additional 32 percent who do not survive beyond the first week of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/10,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,19</a>]. Overall, skeletal dysplasias account for about 5 percent of genetic disorders identified in the newborn period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2348183\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal diagnosis is based primarily upon fetal ultrasound findings, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), radiography, and molecular analysis may be used to support the presumptive diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H2348190\" class=\"local\">'Initial ultrasound evaluation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2348269\" class=\"local\">'Role of specialized imaging techniques'</a> below and <a href=\"#H33600788\" class=\"local\">'Role of molecular diagnostic testing'</a> below.)</p><p>Prenatal screening and diagnosis are primarily performed in the second trimester, but late-first-trimester fetal structural assessment is becoming more common with advances in transvaginal ultrasound imaging and the widespread use of first-trimester nuchal translucency evaluation. Fetal skeletal dysplasias may be suspected because of qualitative bony abnormalities observed during a fetal anatomic survey or because the femur is found to be short for gestational age. In some cases, the initial fetal ultrasound is performed because of a family history of skeletal dysplasia, although the majority has no family history.</p><p>A comprehensive assessment of the fetal skeleton is necessary to determine which bones are affected and the type and severity of the abnormalities. Concurrently, a comprehensive evaluation of all fetal organ systems is performed. The composite findings may or may not point to a specific skeletal dysplasia.</p><p>Over the last decade, the accuracy of prenatal ultrasound for diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia has improved significantly: 68 percent for correct prenatal diagnosis and 31 percent for partially correct diagnosis, with 0.07 percent false positives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/7,15,16,18,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15,16,18,21-24</a>]. Accurate prediction of lethality is even higher (see <a href=\"#H544667513\" class=\"local\">'Prediction of lethality'</a> below). A family history of consanguinity, a sibling or a parent affected with a skeletal dysplasia, or a prior affected fetus can help in making a specific diagnosis. However, the low incidence, phenotypic variability, overlapping features, and lack of family history in the majority of cases make a specific diagnosis, and thus prognostic counseling, difficult.</p><p>Invasive procedures to obtain fetal cells for specific molecular tests can confirm the diagnosis in some cases (see <a href=\"#H33600788\" class=\"local\">'Role of molecular diagnostic testing'</a> below). Despite the rare occurrence of the individual conditions, a combination of radiology, pathology, and molecular analysis could allow classification to a specific group in up to 99 percent of cases using the 2010 Nosology and Classification of Genetic Skeletal Disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/3,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,25</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1156345454\" class=\"local\">'Postnatal/post-termination evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>When a specific skeletal dysplasia cannot be identified, the goal is to determine whether the dysplasia is lethal or nonlethal (see <a href=\"#H544667513\" class=\"local\">'Prediction of lethality'</a> below). Diagnostic accuracy is critical, as the patient may choose to interrupt the pregnancy or avoid cesarean delivery if the skeletal dysplasia is lethal or associated with morbidity and quality of life that are unacceptable to the parents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2348190\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL ULTRASOUND EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skeletal dysplasias may be identified at prenatal ultrasound examination as the high level of intrinsic contrast of the fetal skeleton permits early evaluation of the skeleton by ultrasound. The ultrasound evaluation of the bones includes their presence or absence, length, shape (curvature), and whether there are any fractures. These variables can be well visualized at &ge;14 weeks of gestation as much of the skeleton begins to ossify early in development (the clavicle, mandible, ileum, scapula, and long bones ossify by 12 weeks of gestation; the metacarpals and metatarsals are ossified by 12 to 16 weeks; however, the talus and calcaneus ossify at weeks 22 to 24, epiphyseal ossification centers are seen on radiographs at approximately 20 weeks of gestation, and the carpal bones ossify after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33599731\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fetal femur is generally the only long bone routinely measured at the second-trimester ultrasound evaluation, although many scanning guidelines recommend the systematic documentation of the presence of all extremities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2348199\"><span class=\"h3\">Measurement of femur length</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ossified portion of the femur is measured from the major trochanter to the distal end of the femoral shaft; the distal and proximal epiphyses are not included in the measurement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50944\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50944 \">image 1</a>).

In a Danish population, the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile corresponded to the mean minus 1.645 SD; using the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile would result in a pickup rate that exceeds the expected frequency of skeletal dysplasias.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478122598\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation of the fetus with a mildly shortened femur</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for a mildly shortened femur length includes normal variation, constitutional short limb, a false-positive measurement, fetal growth restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], and aneuploidy (primarily Down syndrome).

There are four main patterns of limb shortening:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rhizomelia, shortening of the proximal segment (femur and humerus)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mesomelia, shortening of the middle segment (radius, ulna, tibia, and fibula)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acromelia, shortening of the distal segment (hands and feet)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Micromelia, shortening of all parts of the limb. Micromelia is further subdivided into mild, mild and bowed, or severe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54680\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54680 \">image 2</a>)</p><p/><p>In the majority of skeletal dysplasias, there is severe micromelia, but the foot is relatively spared. The femur:foot length ratio is normally 1.0 throughout the pregnancy, thus a ratio of less than 1 is useful in distinguishing skeletal dysplasia from other causes of short femur, such as IUGR or aneuploidy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. When the ratio falls below 0.9, the likelihood of a skeletal dysplasia is increased relative to these other diagnoses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2348213\"><span class=\"h3\">Qualitative assessment of long bones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An assessment should be made of shape, contour, mineralization, bowing, angulation, fractures, metaphyseal flaring, and absence of individual bones. The joints should be assessed for deformities.</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Bowing/bending/angulation</span> of the femurs is a finding in more than 40 distinct skeletal disorders, but the four most common are camptomelic dysplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, achondroplasia, and osteogenesis imperfecta.</p><p>Decreased mineralization of the long bones is most reliably diagnosed by the presence of fractures. Bone fractures may appear as angulations or interruptions in the bone contour or as thick, wrinkled contours corresponding to repetitive cycles of fracture and callus formation. Decreased or absent acoustic shadowing of the bones is a less reliable marker for reduced mineralization. These features are common in osteogenesis imperfecta, achondrogenesis, and hypophosphatasia congenita.</p><p>Multiple joint contractures in association with kyphoscoliosis and micromelia is typical of diastrophic dysplasia. Premature ossification of the epiphysis in association with multiple ossification centers (&quot;stippled epiphysis&quot;) is a characteristic of chondrodysplasia punctata.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33600189\"><span class=\"h3\">Qualitative assessment of other bones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific dysmorphic features of bones (eg, clavicular or scapular hypoplasia; aplasia of fibula, tibia, or radius; platyspondyly [flattened vertebral bodies]) can be helpful to further define a specific skeletal dysplasia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2348227\"><span class=\"h4\">Spine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spine is assessed for segmentation anomalies, kyphoscoliosis, platyspondyly, demineralization, myelodysplasia, and caudal regression. Although platyspondyly is the most common spine abnormality, it may be difficult to diagnose on prenatal ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Severe platyspondyly is present in thanatophoric dysplasia and lethal variants of osteogenesis imperfecta. Milder degrees of platyspondyly may be present in conditions such as fibrochondrogenesis, de la Chapelle dysplasia, or Kniest syndrome. Vertebral disorganization with secondary kyphoscoliosis may be associated with syndromes such as dyssegmental dysplasia or Jarcho-Levin syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2348234\"><span class=\"h4\">Hands and feet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common deformities of the hands and feet include clubfoot, rocker bottom foot, clubhand, short fingers (brachydactyly), or an abnormal number of digits. The position of the thumbs and toes can provide a clue to the diagnosis; a hitchhiker or abducted <span class=\"nowrap\">thumb/first</span> toe is present in diastrophic dwarfism. Polydactyly (extra digits) suggests a group of conditions known as short-rib polydactyly syndromes (eg, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy, Saldino-Noonan, etc) and some chromosomal abnormalities. Joint contractures suggest skeletal dysplasias associated with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2348241\"><span class=\"h4\">Calvarium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most skeletal dysplasias with prenatal onset, the long bones are disproportionately short and the calvarium is normal or large. The cranium is also evaluated for macrocranium or microcephaly, frontal bossing, cloverleaf skull deformity, and underlying brain abnormalities. Temporal lobe dysplasia is associated with thanatophoric dysplasia and has been reported in achondroplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. An abnormal cranial contour may indicate craniosynostosis (premature fusion of the sutures). Common craniosynostosis syndromes such as Apert, Crouzon and Pfeiffer manifest with craniosynostosis in association with limb anomalies such as syndactyly rather than short limbs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-craniosynostosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of craniosynostosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=craniosynostosis-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Craniosynostosis syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Decreased mineralization of the calvarium may present with a range of sonographic findings from enlarged fontanelles to extreme demineralization where the midline falx appears more echogenic than the calvarium itself. Abnormal compressibility of the cranial vault with &quot;normal&quot; transducer pressure is considered a reliable finding in cranial vault demineralization. These findings may be associated with osteogenesis imperfecta type 2, achondrogenesis, or hypophosphatasia congenita.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2348248\"><span class=\"h4\">Face</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common facial abnormalities include midface hypoplasia, saddle nose deformity, hypertelorism, cleft lip and palate, frontal bossing, micrognathia, and retrognathia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65436\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65436 \">image 3</a>). The biorbital diameter should be measured to assess for hypotelorism or hypertelorism. Thanatophoric dysplasia is characterized by the combination of midface hypoplasia, saddle nose deformity and frontal bossing. Osteogenesis imperfecta type 2, the lethal variant, typically presents with retrognathia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2934388590\"><span class=\"h4\">Ribs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ribs are assessed for abnormal appearance or number. Associated syndromes with abnormal <span class=\"nowrap\">appearance/number</span> ribs include Poland syndrome, VACTERL association (vertebral abnormalities, anal atresia, cardiac abnormalities, tracheoesophageal fistula, renal abnormalities, limb defect), campomelic dysplasia and chromosome abnormalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2348255\"><span class=\"h4\">Pelvic bones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although important to evaluate, the pelvic bones are difficult to assess on conventional two-dimensional ultrasound (2D US) and additional three-dimensional (3D) techniques may be required to appreciate the shape of the iliac bones and the sacrosciatic notches. Achondrogenesis, a relatively common lethal musculoskeletal dysplasia presents with multiple abnormalities including abnormal decreased mineralization in the ischium and pubic bones. &quot;Squared&quot; iliac bones are features of both thanatophoric dysplasia and achondroplasia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33600291\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-skeletal anatomic survey</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detailed evaluation of the cardiovascular, genitourinary, gastrointestinal, and central nervous system should be done concurrently with the musculoskeletal evaluation. In many short-limb fetal skeletal dysplasias, the skin and subcutaneous layers continue to grow at a faster rate than the long bones, resulting in relatively thickened skin folds, which may be mistaken for hydrops fetalis. Polyhydramnios is common and may be related to a combination of factors, including esophageal compression (by a small chest), micrognathia, associated gastrointestinal abnormalities, and hypotonia with decreased swallowing. The composite findings may or may not point to a specific skeletal dysplasia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2348269\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of specialized imaging techniques</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2348276\"><span class=\"h3\">Three-dimensional ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>3D US is becoming an increasingly useful complement to 2D US in diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia and pulmonary hypoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>].

Chorionic villus sampling (performed transcervically at 11 to 14 weeks of gestation or transabdominally after 11 weeks of gestation) or amniocentesis (performed at &ge;15 weeks of gestation) are methods for obtaining fetal DNA for molecular diagnostic testing.</p><p>Referral for genetic counseling is recommended. The role of molecular studies for diagnosis of a specific skeletal dysplasia in an ongoing pregnancy with no personal or family history is controversial since the time necessary for DNA analysis can be lengthy and a negative result or failure to identify a specific mutation does not change the clinical implications derived from the ultrasound findings. Furthermore, mutations in the same gene can cause different forms of skeletal dysplasia and mutations in different genes can cause the same form of skeletal abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. However, the use of next-generation sequencing and thus panels for fetal skeletal dysplasia decreases the turnaround time and makes the molecular analysis tool more useful in cases suspected of skeletal dysplasia. Since the detailed fetal ultrasound has a high detection rate for lethal skeletal dysplasia, the molecular analysis in these cases is mainly needed for prenatal and preimplantation genetic diagnosis for future pregnancies rather than for prognostication in the affected pregnancy.</p><p>Fetal DNA is analyzed for gene mutations when the fetus is known to be at risk for having skeletal dysplasia because of an affected parent (for autosomal dominant conditions), a carrier mother (for an X-linked condition), or parents identified as being carriers of an autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia (due to a personal or family history of an affected <span class=\"nowrap\">baby/fetus)</span>. Genetic defects have been identified for approximately 70 percent of the over 456 skeletal dysplasias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and can be used to provide early prenatal diagnosis (before diagnostic findings are seen on ultrasound) or preimplantation diagnosis in at-risk families, or to confirm the presumptive diagnosis on imaging performed later in pregnancy. A fetal karyotype or microarray analysis is usually performed at the same time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-chromosomal-microarray-in-obstetrics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of chromosomal microarray in obstetrics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For couples with a prior affected fetus due to a new dominant disorder, there is no consensus whether molecular diagnosis should be performed for a relatively low risk of germline mosaicism. In most of these cases, the risk for a miscarriage associated with the prenatal invasive procedures is probably lower than the risk for the fetus to be affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]; furthermore, fetal ultrasound is reliable in making a relatively early diagnosis. Likewise, the role of molecular diagnosis for a skeletal dysplasia in an ongoing pregnancy is controversial since the time necessary for DNA analysis can be lengthy and a negative result or failure to identify a specific condition does not change the clinical implications derived from the ultrasound findings.</p><p>When both parents are affected with the same or different autosomal dominant skeletal disorders, the fetus is at high risk of lethality because of homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for the same condition, or heterozygosity for two dominant conditions (double heterozygote) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. For example, when both parents are affected with achondroplasia, the most common skeletal dysplasia, the likelihood of having a fetus with homozygote or compound heterozygote mutation in the <em>FGFR3</em> gene associated with achondroplasia, and thus with the lethal form, is 25 percent, while the risk for having a fetus with achondroplasia is 50 percent. In such cases, molecular diagnosis is useful to distinguish between a heterozygote and <span class=\"nowrap\">homozygote/compound</span> heterozygote fetus.</p><p>If the risk of an affected fetus is relatively low, as when one parent has an autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia, the appropriateness of molecular diagnosis is less clear.</p><p>Referral to a genetic counselor is also recommended if one parent has an autosomal dominant skeletal dysplasia, the mother carries an X-linked skeletal dysplasia, or <span class=\"nowrap\">one/both</span> parents are known carriers of an autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia (eg, due to family history).

The three most common conditions detected prenatally are thanatophoric dysplasia, osteogenesis imperfect type 2, and achondrogenesis. (See <a href=\"#H2348162\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2348169\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two-dimensional ultrasound is the primary imaging modality used for the initial assessment of a potentially affected fetus. (See <a href=\"#H2348190\" class=\"local\">'Initial ultrasound evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When fetal skeletal dysplasia is suspected on ultrasound (eg, femur length below 2 standard deviations below the mean for gestational age), the patient should be referred promptly to a tertiary center for specialized fetal evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63933\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63933 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50414\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50414 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H478122598\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of the fetus with a mildly shortened femur'</a> above and <a href=\"#H33599767\" class=\"local\">'Establishing a diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When both parents are affected with the same or different autosomal dominant skeletal disorders, the fetus is at high risk of lethality because of homozygosity or compound heterozygosity (for the same condition) or heterozygosity for two dominant conditions (double heterozygosity). In such cases, it is useful to identify the parental mutations before pregnancy and offer prenatal or preimplantation genetic diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H33600788\" class=\"local\">'Role of molecular diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary role of antenatal diagnosis is to predict lethality. It is important to use multiple parameters, such as a thoracic circumference below the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile, an abnormal thoracic:abdominal circumference, and a markedly narrowed sagittal anteroposterior diameter of the thorax to diagnose lethality. Secondary goals are to determine the diagnosis or narrow the differential diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H544667513\" class=\"local\">'Prediction of lethality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once a determination regarding the lethality and possible diagnosis is made, the couple should be counseled and given options by a team which includes perinatal imaging specialists, medical geneticists, maternal-fetal medicine specialists, and neonatologists. If both parents have skeletal dysplasia, their diagnoses should be determined and the implications of these diagnoses on their pregnancy should be discussed, including the mode of delivery and the postnatal management. (See <a href=\"#H544667520\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After delivery or pregnancy termination, the diagnosis should be <span class=\"nowrap\">determined/confirmed</span> using clinical, radiographic, photographic, histomorphic analysis and DNA analysis. Cell culture and DNA should be banked and used for microarray and molecular analysis. The parents should be seen again to discuss the results and the implications these may have on their future reproductive plans.
