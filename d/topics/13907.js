In 1952, shortly before the introduction of the polio vaccine, more than 20,000 cases were reported in the US. Introduction of the inactivated polio vaccine in 1954 resulted in a dramatic decline of new polio cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polio and infectious diseases of the anterior horn&quot;, section on 'Poliovirus and poliomyelitis'</a>.)</p><p>Although polio no longer poses a major public health threat in developed nations, a 1987 survey estimated that there were 640,000 Americans living with the sequelae of paralytic polio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These sequelae are static for many and reflect the state of recovery reached after the initial disease. Although not well studied, most polio survivors experience a modest decline in function and muscle strength over many years that may reflect the natural history of old polio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Other patients, however, experience a syndrome of new or progressive disability, usually occurring decades after the disease itself. These new symptoms are quite variable, and include increased muscle weakness, focal or generalized muscle atrophy, fatigue, pain, and decreased ambulatory abilities. It has become clear that this condition, called post-polio syndrome (PPS), has both neurologic and non-neurologic components.</p><p>The clinical findings, etiology, and treatment of PPS will be reviewed here. Issues regarding polio vaccination are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poliovirus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Poliovirus vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of progressive neurologic deterioration in PPS is unknown. The main theories of pathogenesis involve progressive degeneration of reinnervated motor units, persistence of poliovirus in neural tissue, and induction of autoimmunity with consequent destruction of neural structures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Motor unit degeneration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In poliomyelitis, there is progressive loss of motor neurons with subsequent denervation. This phenomenon is partially compensated by reinnervation of the muscle fibers through collateral sprouting, which results in motor unit enlargement. It is postulated that the symptoms of PPS (eg, increased weakness) result when this compensatory mechanism is overwhelmed.</p><p>One possibility is that the expanded architecture of reinnervated motor units creates a greater metabolic demand, which over time leads to instability of reinnervated neuromuscular junctions, ultimately followed by failure of neuromuscular transmission. This hypothesis is supported by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrophysiologic studies suggesting that the most extensively reinnervated motor units are more likely to become unstable later in life, with failure of neuromuscular transmission ultimately occurring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence that excessive exercise or overuse predisposes to new weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle biopsy studies showing that pathologic angulated fibers become more frequent as a function of the time elapsed since the acute episode of polio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]&nbsp;(see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Muscle biopsy'</a> below)</p><p/><p>Another possibility is that the normal aging process contributes to further loss of motor units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Motor neuron degeneration itself may underlie the motor unit loss. In support of this notion, a small case-control study found that patients with PPS had significantly increased cerebrospinal fluid expression of five proteins (gelsolin, hemopexin, peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase, glutathione synthetase, and kallikrein 6) that are known to be involved in different pathways mediating neurodegeneration, such as apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Persistence of poliovirus in the nervous system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence and reactivation of persistent poliovirus has been invoked to explain the progression of motor neuron degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Poliovirus and other enteroviruses can persist in the central nervous system as well as systemically in immunodeficient children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enterovirus-and-parechovirus-infections-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Enterovirus and parechovirus infections: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies in tissue culture have shown that poliovirus mutants can persist in neurons in a latent state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Support for the persistent poliovirus hypothesis was provided by a 1991 study demonstrating poliovirus antibodies and poliovirus-sensitized cells in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with PPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, other studies have failed to demonstrate poliovirus antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with PPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/10,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,15</a>], and most studies that have sought poliovirus RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with PPS by polymerase chain reaction have been negative or inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammation and induction of autoimmunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The strongest support for an inflammatory or immune-mediated mechanism for PPS comes from an autopsy study demonstrating inflammation in the spinal cord of seven patients with PPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Perivascular and parenchymal lymphocytic infiltrates as well as neuronal degeneration with active gliosis were noted, and all of these changes were more prominent in the three patients with clearly progressive weakness.</p><p>Further evidence comes from the observations that expression of certain proinflammatory cytokines is increased in cerebrospinal fluid (tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma) and serum (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6 and leptin) of patients with PPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Increased expression of enzymes of the E2 prostaglandin pathway in the muscles affected by PPS has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The finding of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid also has been interpreted to support the immune hypothesis, although the presence of inflammation does not indicate whether the immune response is a primary cause of disease or merely a reaction to persistent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, a study of the presence of GM1 antibodies in sera of patients with prior polio showed no increased incidence as compared with age-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimates of the incidence and prevalence of PPS vary greatly according to the criteria used for establishing the diagnosis. If patients are simply asked whether they have experienced new symptoms related to prior polio, about one-half respond affirmatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These symptoms include weakness, pain, fatigability, and concentration difficulty. However, if new, progressive weakness is a criterion, the frequency drops to approximately 20 to 30 percent of polio survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>On average, the onset of new symptoms occurs approximately 35 years after the initial polio episode, but the delay can range between 8 and 71 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/11,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,24-26</a>]. PPS occurs sooner in patients with more severe original disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27</a>].</p><p>In addition to the severity of the original paralysis, two other risk factors influence the likelihood of developing PPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/5,11,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11,27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The age at which acute polio occurred (when acute poliomyelitis occurs in adolescents and adults, the disease is generally more severe than in infants and small children, and these older patients are more likely to subsequently develop PPS).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The extent to which patients recover from the initial disease (the greater the recovery, the more likely PPS will occur).</p><p/><p>The relationship between the degree of recovery and the likelihood of developing PPS suggests that new symptoms may be due to failure of the compensatory processes that facilitated the initial recovery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PPS is a disorder with both neurologic and musculoskeletal components. Most commonly, symptoms include progressive weakness, fatigue, and pain in the muscles or joints. Restless leg syndrome also may be associated with PPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Muscle atrophy, breathing and swallowing difficulties, other sleep disorders, and cold intolerance occur less frequently.</p><p>Progressive weakness and muscle atrophy are a direct consequence of ongoing damage to the motor unit, which is defined as the spinal motor neuron, its axon, the neuromuscular junction, and all of the muscle fibers innervated by that motor axon. Breathing and swallowing difficulties are also probably due to motor unit dysfunction, while fatigue, joint and muscle pains, and worsening bony deformities usually reflect involvement of the bony skeleton, ligaments, and joints. As many of these symptoms are nonspecific (especially fatigue), PPS can be difficult to diagnose unless multiple musculoskeletal or neurologic findings are present. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Progressive muscle weakness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progressive muscle weakness occurs in the majority of patients with PPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. The new weakness always occurs in muscles previously affected by the original disease, although the previous involvement may have been subclinical and only detectable electrophysiologically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The distribution of the new weakness is often asymmetric, and usually correlates with the severity of paralysis at the time of the acute poliomyelitis and with the amount of recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As with the original disease, the new weakness can be proximal or distal and is often quite patchy. Focal atrophy occasionally accompanies the weakness, but occurs less than one-half of the time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>New muscle weakness may produce respiratory insufficiency, bulbar muscle weakness, and sleep apnea. Respiratory insufficiency primarily occurs in patients with severe residual respiratory impairment and with minimal reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Similar to extremity weakness, respiratory failure is more likely to occur in patients who required respiratory support during the acute illness and who contracted polio when over 10 years of age. PPS patients with chronic respiratory failure lose an average of 1.9 percent of vital capacity per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>Respiratory insufficiency usually is due to respiratory muscle weakness but occasionally is related to central hypoventilation because of residual damage from bulbar poliomyelitis. Respiratory failure may begin with nocturnal alveolar hypoventilation, and patients may require only nighttime respiratory support; however, more severely affected patients may ultimately require total ventilatory support. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory dysfunction'</a> below.)</p><p>New focal weakness of the bulbar musculature also occurs in PPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/37-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-41</a>]. Residual dysphagia occurs commonly in polio survivors as a result of weakness in pharyngeal and laryngeal muscles. This may worsen in PPS, with patients complaining of choking and coughing. Dysarthria may also occur as a result of facial weakness or vocal cord paralysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-evaluation-of-dysphagia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the evaluation of dysphagia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Fatigue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fatigue is the most common symptom of PPS and occurs in approximately 80 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/30,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,42</a>]. It is often described as a disabling, generalized exhaustion occurring suddenly after minimal exertion. Some patients experience generalized weakness, while others report focal loss of strength with exertion, generally in already weak or weakening muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Symptoms may be so severe as to impair concentration and mental functioning. With rest, symptoms abate, although sleep is often more effective than simple cessation of fatiguing activities. In some patients with PPS, fatigue exhibits circadian variation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], perhaps related to unrecognized restless leg syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p>The pathophysiology of this excessive fatigue is unclear. Studies investigating exercise-related failure of motor unit function have found that abnormalities similar to those seen in myasthenia gravis are present in 10 to 20 percent of patients with PPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>In contrast to generalized fatigue, muscle fatigue is characterized by loss of strength and decreased endurance during exercise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain can develop for many reasons in PPS, including the development of spinal deformities such as kyphoscoliosis, degenerative joint disease, and joint instability, all of which can develop without new weakness. If polio occurred in childhood, uneven limb size can contribute to long-term musculoskeletal degeneration, as can failing surgical interventions such as tendon transfers and joint fusions. Progression of these symptoms can further stress an asymmetric skeleton and may require the reinstitution of ambulatory assistive devices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical examination of patients with PPS is notable for generally asymmetric weakness with lower motor neuron findings (eg, atrophy, fasciculations), with or without the superimposed musculoskeletal findings described above. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Progressive muscle weakness'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine blood tests, including the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, are normal in PPS. Nevertheless, blood tests are useful to help exclude systemic disease as the cause of the late weakness and other symptoms.</p><p>Exercise may result in dramatic elevations of creatine kinase in patients with polio-related weakness, but it is not clear that such increases distinguish between those with and without PPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/11,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,46,47</a>].</p><p>Cerebrospinal fluid parameters have been normal in most studies, although mild protein elevations or oligoclonal bands are sometimes observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Electromyography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electromyography (EMG) of patients with prior polio has provided insight into the pathophysiology of poliomyelitis, but cannot clearly distinguish between patients with a history of polio and those with PPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. EMG is useful to confirm previous poliomyelitis, including its extent and severity, and to exclude other neuromuscular conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, radiculopathy, neuropathy, and myopathy.</p><p>EMG studies show that patients with a history of polio frequently have signs of chronic motor neuron loss in areas that are clinically normal. These abnormalities include the presence of motor units that are increased in size and prolonged in duration as compared with normal. Increased motor unit size occurs as a compensatory change in response to ongoing loss of motor neurons or their axons. Since both patients with remote polio and those with PPS have had a loss of motor neurons, it is not surprising that motor unit changes seen on EMG do not distinguish between these two processes.</p><p>In addition, motor unit number estimation, which measures the number of functional motor units innervating individual muscles, is abnormal in patients with a history of prior polio and in those with PPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. There is no clear distinction between patients with prior polio or PPS with respect to either the number of motor units measured or the rate of decline of motor units.</p><p>Fibrillation potentials, which imply the presence of ongoing motor axon loss, theoretically should help distinguish patients undergoing new motor unit degeneration from stable patients with remote polio. However, these potentials are seen in the minority of patients with prior polio, whether or not they note new weakness. Other measures that indicate instability of the motor unit are frequently abnormal in all patients with prior polio. While weak muscles show more frequent and more severe abnormalities than strong muscles, muscles with progressive weakness cannot clearly be distinguished from those with static abnormalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscle biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As is the case with EMG studies, all of the abnormalities on muscle biopsy are nonspecific and can be seen in patients with a history of polio, with or without new progressive weakness. Biopsy findings in patients with old poliomyelitis reveal evidence of chronic denervation and reinnervation as well as active denervation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Chronic changes are manifested by fiber type grouping, in which the normal mosaic of fiber types is replaced by a pattern where fibers of a single type are clumped together. This is the morphological equivalent of the prolonged duration, increased amplitude motor units seen on EMG study.</p><p>One sign of active denervation is the presence of small angulated fibers, which suggests degeneration of terminal motor axon sprouts. Another finding that supports active denervation is the expression of neural-cell adhesion molecules on the surface of muscle fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>]. Group atrophy, which suggests acute axonal destruction or motor neuron death, is seen less frequently in PPS than in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but this is not an absolute finding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H245624449\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscle ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Quantitative muscle ultrasound is a promising noninvasive tool to evaluate for disease severity and to monitor for disease progression in patients with PPS, though data are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The ultrasound parameters, including echo intensity and muscle thickness, are used for measurement of muscle quantity and quality, thus distinguishing healthy from diseased muscle. This method might prove especially useful for patients with PPS who have limited ability to participate with strength tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-ultrasound-in-neuromuscular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic ultrasound in neuromuscular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no pathognomonic findings that distinguish PPS from remote polio. The diagnosis of PPS is made on clinical grounds in the presence of consistent laboratory, electrophysiologic, and biopsy data. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Criteria for diagnosis of PPS syndrome were first described in 1972 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], and subsequently revised in the 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>] and the 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The criteria are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prior episode of poliomyelitis with evidence of residual motor neuron loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A period of at least 15 years after the acute onset of polio with neurologic and functional stability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A gradual (or rarely abrupt) onset of new weakness and abnormal muscle fatigability that persists for at least one year</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exclusion of other medical conditions that cause similar symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/31,55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,55,56</a>] </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of PPS is primarily symptomatic and supportive, addressing new muscle weakness, decreased endurance (muscle fatigue), musculoskeletal pain and joint instability, fatigue, respiratory dysfunction, dysphagia, dysphonia, and sleep disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. Care should be multidisciplinary, as psychological and social factors are often present, and many of the above symptoms are best addressed by specialists other than the treating neurologist.</p><p>Nonfatiguing muscle strengthening exercise programs can address muscle deconditioning, preserve endurance, and improve muscle strength in patients with PPS, as discussed in the next section. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">New muscle weakness and muscle fatigue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muscle weakness and muscle fatigue can be treated with nonfatiguing exercise programs that use low intensity sessions with short repetitions lasting several seconds, alternating with intervals of rest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Overexertion or overuse should be avoided during these sessions.</p><p>Evidence of benefit comes from the following reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 12 week randomized controlled trial of 10 patients with PPS found that those assigned to moderate intensity strength training showed significantly greater improvements in muscle strength than controls assigned to no training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several small uncontrolled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/60-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-65</a>] have also reported that nonfatiguing exercise programs improve strength in patients with PPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p>Given these data, we suggest treatment with nonfatiguing exercise programs for patients with PPS who are able to participate.</p><p>The aerobic training intensity should be tailored to stimulate a training effect but avoiding muscular overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>]. One proposed technique to accomplish this is by determining the anaerobic threshold, which is a direct indicator of aerobic capacity. This parameter can be identified in some patients with PPS by submaximal incremental exercise training on a cycle ergometer with heart rate monitoring and breath-by-breath gas exchange analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>Another strategy employs pacing of physical activities with work-rest programs (eg, inserting two minute rest periods after perceived exertion is deemed excessive or after six minutes of continuous work is performed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/57,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,69</a>]. In a small uncontrolled study of patients with PPS, work-rest interval programs were associated with decreased local muscle fatigue, increased work capacity, and increased recovery of strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>Controlled trials evaluating the impact of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> on muscle strength failed to show any benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Generalized fatigue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generalized fatigue is described as exhaustion with minimal exertion. This is distinct from muscle fatigue, which is characterized by loss of strength and decreased endurance during exercise. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p>The approach toward fatigue consists of energy conservation measures combined with an individualized, regular nonfatiguing exercise program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Measures to prevent or treat obesity and the use of assistive devices are beneficial in conservation of energy. As previously mentioned, pacing of physical activities with work-rest programs can decrease local muscle fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>Pharmacologic therapy also has been employed to treat fatigue, although data for the efficacy of any single agent are minimal. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amantadine</a> was not effective in one small controlled trial of very low methodologic quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>] but still is considered helpful in selected cases. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amitriptyline</a> has not been studied in a controlled trial but may help fatigue in a small percentage of cases, possibly by controlling pain. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Modafinil</a> was not beneficial in two randomized controlled trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/post-polio-syndrome/abstract/75-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-77</a>].</p><p>Recognizing and treating restless legs syndrome is important because it may be an additional cause for fatigue experienced by patients with PPS (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Fatigue'</a> above).
