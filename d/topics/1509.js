These trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>] and their meta-analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>] have demonstrated that among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) at <strong>moderate to high risk</strong> of thromboembolic events (CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc risk stratification score &ge;2), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> significantly reduces the incidence of clinical stroke at an acceptable risk of bleeding compared to placebo. The benefit to risk ratio from oral anticoagulation in patients at <strong>very low </strong>(CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 0) and <strong>low risk </strong>(CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 1) has not been well studied (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F94752\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94752 \">table 1</a>).

In one contemporary study, the annual risk of ischemic stroke in untreated patients was 0.2, 0.6, and 2.2 percent for those with CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores of 0, 1, and 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>The SPAF-I, SPAF-II, and SPAF-III trials, and AFASAK, BAATAF, SPINAF, and CAFA randomly assigned more than 4000 patients with nonvalvular AF to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, placebo, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and demonstrated that anticoagulation with adjusted-dose warfarin significantly reduces clinical stroke risk when compared to placebo (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79839\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79839 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>].

In an observational study (ATRIA), patients in a community-based, clinical practice cohort who were taking warfarin had lower risks in all CHADS2 risk score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F94752\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94752 \">table 1</a>) groups (range 0.25 to 4.60 percent per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Studies evaluating more contemporary data have found that the absolute risk of stroke in untreated patients has fallen from about 8 to 4 or 5 percent per year, but the relative risk reduction attributable to antithrombotic therapy is in the same range as earlier studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. We believe a two-thirds risk reduction at this lower absolute risk is clinically important. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization#H1052522978\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Risk of embolization&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the lowering of stroke risk, there is evidence that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, compared to no anticoagulant therapy, leads to less severe stroke episodes and lower 30-day stroke mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization/abstract/8,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H898176153\"><span class=\"h2\">Increase in bleeding risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major safety concern with the use of all antithrombotic agents is the increased risk of bleeding, especially major bleeding, which includes events that require hospitalization, transfusion, surgery, or involves particularly sensitive anatomic locations. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is the most serious bleeding complication since the likelihood of mortality or subsequent major disability is substantially higher than bleeding at other sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In most contemporary studies, this risk is about 0.2 to 0.4 percent per year, or perhaps slightly higher. While this risk is not trivial, it is substantially lower than the risk of ischemic stroke in the vast majority of AF patients with CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc &gt;=2 who are not anticoagulated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-of-intracerebral-bleeding-in-patients-treated-with-anticoagulants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk of intracerebral bleeding in patients treated with anticoagulants&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Overanticoagulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (as defined as an international normalized ratio greater than 3), prior stroke, and increasing patient age are three of the most important predictors of major bleeding, including ICH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization/abstract/13,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,20-22</a>]. The risk of bleeding in contemporary practice was evaluated in a cohort of over 16,000 patients who received a diagnosis of AF between 2005 and 2010. The incidence of major bleeding with current, recent, past, or no warfarin exposure was 3.8, 4.5, 2.7, and 2.9 per 100 patient-years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, major bleeding was the sum of ICH, extracranial bleeding, and gastrointestinal bleeding. We think that most patients would want to balance the risk of reduction in ischemic stroke with the increase in ICH, not with a gastrointestinal bleed or other less serious bleeding. Thus, in this study and others, the annual risk of ICH in patients with AF who are not anticoagulated is estimated to be 0.2 percent; that risk approximately doubles with anticoagulation with warfarin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization/abstract/14,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17</a>]. Most studies have shown that the risk of ICH with the non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs; both direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors) may be less than half of that with warfarin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-of-intracerebral-bleeding-in-patients-treated-with-anticoagulants#H13349468\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk of intracerebral bleeding in patients treated with anticoagulants&quot;, section on 'Dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H616111774\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSING INDIVIDUAL PATIENT RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although tools (eg, risk scores for assessing the benefit from stroke reduction or the increase in bleeding risk with anticoagulation) are available, these instruments do not have a high predictive ability. This is likely due to at least two reasons: The patient risk factors entered into the tools are not equivalent in terms of the event rate associated with them AND the risk associated with many of the risk factors represents a range. For example, in the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc risk model (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F94752\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94752 \">table 1</a>), age 65 to 74 years is one risk factor. However, the risk of a 65-year-old man is lower than that for a 74-year-old, perhaps by a significant amount. The same logic applies to any bleeding risk score. (See <a href=\"#H616111830\" class=\"local\">'Estimating bleeding risk'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H616111802\"><span class=\"h2\">Estimating embolic risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Embolic risk in an individual patient is estimated using tools that are imperfect, as discussed directly above. However, we believe the current preferred tool is the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc risk model (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-cha2ds2-vasc-risk-stratification-score-for-estimation-of-stroke-risk-for-nonvalvular-atrial-fibrillation-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). With this risk model, the individual patient will have a score of 0, 1, or &ge;2. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization#H1052526135\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Risk of embolization&quot;, section on 'Our approach to risk estimation'</a>.)</p><p>Each CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score (eg 0, 1, or &ge;2) represents a range of risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F94752\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94752 \">table 1</a>), with a mean rate (of stroke) of 0.2, 0.6, and 2.2 percent per year for CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc scores of 0, 1, and 2. However, the stroke rate can vary with study setting (eg, community versus hospitalized), population studied, etc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], as well as appropriate methodology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>A few studies have examined ischemic stroke rates with a single risk factor (ie, CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc=1 in males, 2 in females). One study suggested that these patients have an ischemic stroke rate &lt;1 percent per year, which was lower than those previously reported; however, this study excluded patients that had ever used oral anticoagulation; thus, rates may be biased towards low risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Another study reported that the ischemic stroke rate with a single risk factor was approximately 2.5 to 2.7 percent per year if untreated, with the highest risks evident for age 65 to 74 and diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The Danish nationwide cohort study found ischemic stroke rates with a single stroke risk factor being approximately 1.5 percent per year; of note, mortality was high in such patients, and both stroke and mortality were lowered by use of oral anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. A net clinical benefit (NCB) analysis in patients with one stroke risk factor clearly shows a positive NCB for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> compared to no treatment, or warfarin compared to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Similar conclusions were reported from the Loire Valley Atrial Fibrillation project, showing that even one non-gender-related stroke risk factor confers a significant risk of stroke and death, with a positive net clinical benefit (NCB) for oral anticoagulation compared with aspirin or no antithrombotic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-risk-of-embolization#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial fibrillation: Risk of embolization&quot;, section on 'Options for estimating risk in the individual patient'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-of-intracerebral-bleeding-in-patients-treated-with-anticoagulants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk of intracerebral bleeding in patients treated with anticoagulants&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-warfarin-associated-bleeding-or-supratherapeutic-inr#H624013\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of warfarin-associated bleeding or supratherapeutic INR&quot;, section on 'Bleeding risk'</a>.)</p><p>One problem with the bleeding risk scores is that they were developed from studies that included bleeds of differing severity. While any bleed can lead to death or severe disability, they usually do not. The major exception to this is intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). For the purposes of estimating bleeding risk, we think that most patients care deeply about ICH risk and to a lesser extent about epistaxis or gastrointestinal bleeding requiring hospitalization and possibly transfusion. The former (ICH) can be equated in severity to an ischemic stroke while the latter cannot. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-of-intracerebral-bleeding-in-patients-treated-with-anticoagulants#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk of intracerebral bleeding in patients treated with anticoagulants&quot;, section on 'Predictors of risk'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-of-intracerebral-bleeding-in-patients-treated-with-anticoagulants#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk of intracerebral bleeding in patients treated with anticoagulants&quot;, section on 'ICH risk with antithrombotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Multiple observational studies and randomized trials report the risk of ICH attributable to anticoagulant therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> to be in the range of 0.2 to 0.4 percent per year.<strong> </strong>(See <a href=\"#H898176153\" class=\"local\">'Increase in bleeding risk'</a> above.)

As the benefit generally outweighs the risk, we recommend oral anticoagulant therapy for all but the lowest embolization-risk patients. The benefits and risks of anticoagulation must be carefully discussed with each patient. In order for this discussion to take place, the clinician needs to understand the process of assessing risk, which is discussed directly above. For patients with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of 1 and a few patients with a score of 0 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-cha2ds2-vasc-risk-stratification-score-for-estimation-of-stroke-risk-for-nonvalvular-atrial-fibrillation-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), <strong>clinical judgment</strong> is needed when helping the patient decide.

All studies have concluded that the benefit from anticoagulation significantly exceeds the risks for almost all AF patients with a CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score &ge;2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization/abstract/11,13,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13,30,31</a>].</p><p>As an example, the ATRIA study evaluated the net clinical benefit (NCB) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> in 13,559 patients with nonvalvular AF identified from an outpatient database in 1996 and 1997 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atrial-fibrillation-anticoagulant-therapy-to-prevent-embolization/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. NCB was defined as the difference between annualized rate of thromboembolic events prevented by warfarin, minus the annualized rate of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) induced by warfarin, multiplied by a weighting factor. In the base case model, ICH was weighted as 1.5 times the impact of ischemic stroke, reflecting relative case-fatality rates. Outcomes were evaluated in the warfarin and no-warfarin groups (approximately 50 percent of the latter were on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>) over a median follow-up of six years. The NCB became significant at a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 2 (one event prevented per 100 patient-years) and progressively increased at higher CHADS<sub>2</sub> scores (2.2 events prevented per 100 patient-years at a CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 4 to 6).

The particular risk factor present may influence decision making. In particular, older age is the most significant risk factor in these considerations. <strong>Clinical judgment</strong> will play an important role in helping these patients choose between anticoagulation or no anticoagulation.</p><p>Our uncertainty regarding the optimal approach in these patients is the result of at least two problems: Few such patients have been enrolled in clinical trials, and the risk of embolization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F94752\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94752 \">table 1</a>) attributable to the individual risk factors (that might lead to a score of 1) is not equal.
