Here are the terms doctors use to describe different types of burns:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Superficial skin burn </strong>(used to be called a &quot;first-degree burn&quot;): The burn is only on the top layer of your skin. Your skin will be dry, red, and painful (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60417\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60417 \">picture 1</a>). When you press the burn, it turns white. Superficial skin burns heal in 3 to 6 days without leaving a scar.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Superficial partial-thickness burn</strong> (used to be called a &quot;second-degree burn&quot;): The burn is on the top 2 layers of your skin, but does not go deep into the second layer. Your skin will hurt with a light touch or if the air temperature changes. The skin will be red and leak fluid, and you might get blisters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65552\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65552 \">picture 2</a>). The burn will turn white when you press it. Superficial partial-thickness burns take 7 to 21 days to heal, and the area of skin that was burned might be darker or lighter than it used to be. The burn might or might not leave a scar.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Deep partial-thickness burn</strong> (used to be called a &quot;third-degree burn&quot;): This kind of burn also affects the top 2 layers of skin, but is deeper than a superficial partial-thickness burn (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F54524\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54524 \">picture 3</a>). The burn will hurt when you press it hard, but it will not turn white. You will get blisters. This kind of burn takes more than 21 days to heal, and will probably leave a scar.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Full-thickness burn</strong> (used to be called a &quot;fourth-degree burn&quot;): Full-thickness burns include all the layers of the skin and often affect the fat and muscle underneath. The burn does not usually hurt, and the burned skin can be white, gray, or black (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F63587\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63587 \">picture 4</a>). The skin feels dry. Your doctor will treat this kind of burn with surgery. You might also need to stay in the hospital for a time and take medicines.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30482223\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if you are not sure how bad your burn is, or if the burn:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involves your face, hands, feet, or genitals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is on or near a joint, such as your knee or shoulder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Goes all the way around a part of your body (such as your arm or leg)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is bigger than 3 inches across or goes deep into the skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Causes a fever of at least 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C) or shows other signs of infection. Infected skin gets more and more red, is painful, and might leak pus.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Goes deeper than the top layer of skin AND you have not had a tetanus shot in more than 5 years</p><p/><p>People younger than 5 years or older than 70 years with any kind of skin burn should also see their doctor. Plus, people who have trouble fighting infection, for example because they have cancer or HIV, should see a doctor if they have a burn that goes deeper than a superficial burn.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30482230\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your burn is not too severe, you can take the following steps:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clean the burn: Take any clothes off of the area and wash it with cool water and plain soap. If your clothes stick to the burn, go to the emergency room.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cool the burn: After you have cleaned the skin, you can put a cool cloth on it or soak your skin in cool water. Do not use ice to cool the burn.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevent infection: If the burn goes deeper than the top layer of skin, you are at risk of infection. To help prevent infection, you can use aloe vera gel or cream, or an antibiotic cream. If your burn forms blisters, cover it with a clean, non-stick bandage and change the bandage once or twice a day. Do not pop the blisters, because that can lead to infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat pain: If the burn hurts, try raising the burned part of your body to a level above your heart. For instance, if you burned your foot, try lying down and propping your foot up on pillows. This slows blood flow to the area and can prevent swelling and ease pain. You can also take over-the-counter pain medicine, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not scratch the burn: Scratching can increase the risk of infection.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30482237\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a skin burn treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the burn does not need a doctor's care right away, you can start by trying the steps above to clean your burn, prevent infection, and treat your pain. If you have a more serious burn, your doctor might give you a stronger medicine for pain or apply special bandages. For a severe burn, your doctor might suggest surgery to repair the area that was burned. He or she might also prescribe medicines to prevent infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30482244\"><span class=\"h1\">Can skin burns be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce the chances that you or your children will get burned by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keeping candles, matches, and lighters away from children</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keeping any hot objects away from the edge of the table or stove (examples include foods or liquids, or the handles of pots and pans) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a humidifier with cool mist, not warm mist or steam</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keeping children away from hot stoves, fireplaces, and ovens</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a smoke detector on each floor of your home</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dressing your children in clothes that do not catch fire easily &ndash; especially at night.
