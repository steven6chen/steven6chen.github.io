To date, no forms of thalassemia arising primarily from defects in iron or heme metabolism have been described. All known forms are due to inherited defects in the biosynthesis or post-translational stability of the globin subunits themselves.</p><p>Because of their small size, their arrangement into relatively compact gene clusters, and their well characterized physiology, pathology, and clinical genetics, the globin genes were the first human genes to be cloned and thoroughly characterized. The mutations that cause the thalassemia syndromes were the first to be defined at the level of their DNA structure. Indeed, the delineation of the impact of these mutations on mRNA and protein expression provided the paradigm for the identification of mutations causing other diseases.</p><p>The molecular pathology of the thalassemic syndromes will be discussed here. This subject is best understood from the perspective of the normal structure and function of the genes encoding the individual globins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The first section of this review will outline the essential features of normal hemoglobin biosynthesis and its underlying molecular biology.

Thus, any clinician confronted with findings suggestive of a hemoglobinopathy should consult with their clinical pathology laboratory about getting direct analysis of the hemoglobin profile <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> globin gene profile that might aid diagnosis. Very few labs possess this capability locally but nearly all maintain a connection to a reference laboratory. In this author&rsquo;s experience, these reference labs also do a good job of guiding interpretation of the results.

The LCR appears to interact with a combination of transcription factors at the onset of erythroid maturation in such a way as to enhance access of the transcriptional machinery and other transcriptional factors to the promoters, enhancers, and silencers within the gene complex. In this sense, some regard the LCR as a &quot;super enhancer.&quot; LCR function is absolutely required for expression of globin genes at the extraordinary high levels needed to support normal hemoglobin production.</p><p/><p>Normal hemoglobin biosynthesis requires an intact structural gene and the structural and spatial integrity of silencers, enhancers, promoters, and LCR sequences. Despite considerable effort, we do not fully understand how the sequences and factors regulating globin gene expression interact with one another to ensure high levels of expression of the proper globins at the proper developmental stage and during the proper steps of erythroid differentiation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-globin locus mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly all of the mutations causing thalassemia reside in or near the globin locus, but at least two interesting exceptions have been reported with the GATA-1 and ATRX genes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">GATA-1 mutations and beta thalassemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GATA-1 is a transcription factor on the X chromosome that is important for activating many genes during erythropoiesis, including globin genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In individuals with the R216Q mutation, beta thalassemia occurs in conjunction with thrombocytopenia and dyserythropoietic anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The basis for selective impairment of the beta locus in the two involved families is unclear but may be related to the impact of the mutation on an interacting factor called &quot;friend of GATA-1&quot; (FOG-1), or other as yet unknown factors that affect the activation of the beta globin gene disproportionately.

The protein product of this gene affects broad patterns of gene transcription and participates in epigenetic remodeling of chromatin.</p><p>Somatic mutations of this locus appear to account for at least some of the cases of acquired alpha thalassemia (also called acquired hemoglobin H disease) encountered in a subset of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and more rarely in AML and other myeloproliferative disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Of interest, most of those affected have been elderly men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-myelodysplastic-syndromes#H4008672\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the myelodysplastic syndromes&quot;, section on 'Acquired hemoglobin H disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Transcription into messenger RNA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The alpha-like genes are 1100 bases long, and beta-like genes, about 1800 bases long. Each contains three exons, ultimately coding for globin messenger RNA (mRNA). The exons are separated by two introns, which are transcribed into the mRNA precursor but subsequently excised by pre-mRNA splicing. Splicing knits the exons together in precise register, producing the functional mRNA.</p><p>Intranuclear processing of globin mRNA includes the addition of a &quot;cap&quot; structure at the 5' end of the mRNA molecules, and a stretch of adenylate (A) residues (the &quot;poly-A tail&quot;) at the 3' end. The 5' cap facilitates efficient translation of the mRNA nucleotide sequence into the amino acid sequence of the globin polypeptide, while the poly-A tail promotes mRNA stability.</p><p>The fully spliced and modified globin mRNA is transported from nucleus to cytoplasm. Once regarded as a passive process of diffusion, mRNA transport is now known to be a complex, energy consuming, and, probably, regulated process. No forms of thalassemia due to primary defects in mRNA transport have been described. However, impaired mRNA transport may be a secondary abnormality that contributes to reduced accumulation of certain thalassemic globin mRNAs with impaired splicing or translational capacity.</p><p>The amount of protein arising from the activity of a globin gene depends on three interacting cytoplasmic processes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>the amount of mature mRNA delivered to the cytoplasm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>the rate of mRNA translation into proteins by polyribosomes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>the rate at which mRNA is degraded</p><p/><p>In the case of normal human globin genes, virtually all of the initial pre-mRNA transcripts are delivered in fully functional spliced form to the cytoplasm as mature globin mRNA. The critical need for an equal balance of alpha and non-alpha globin synthesis appears to be met largely by the inherent maximal activity of the alpha and non-alpha genes expressed at each stage of ontogeny. This appears to be assured by nearly equal rates of alpha and beta-like mRNA transcription. However, as will be discussed below, equal synthesis of alpha and beta globin protein depends on the interplay between the individual translational efficiencies and stabilities of alpha and beta-like mRNAs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">mRNA stability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal globin mRNAs are extraordinarily long lived. While the typical half-life of most mammalian mRNAs is less than six hours, alpha globin mRNA has a half-life of about 30 hours, while that of beta globin mRNA is 15 to 20 hours. Delta globin mRNA is much shorter lived, with a half-life of 3.5 hours, a feature that probably explains why the anucleate circulating reticulocytes, which retain only mRNA synthesized one to two days earlier at the erythroblast stage, produce no new delta globin chains. Gamma, epsilon, and zeta mRNAs appear to have stabilities about the same, or slightly less, than that of beta globin mRNA.</p><p>The extraordinary stability of globin messenger RNAs resides in stabilizing sequences located in the 3' untranslated sequences (3' UTR) of the mRNA molecule. These stabilizer elements, best characterized for human alpha globin mRNA, bind to proteins which confer resistance to nucleolytic cleavage. Forms of thalassemia resulting from mutations of these sequences have not been described. However, certain forms of alpha thalassemia, of which hemoglobin Hb Constant Spring is the prototype, exhibit markedly reduced stability, due to secondary disruption of the interactions between 3' UTR stabilizer sequences and their binding proteins. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Failed translation termination: Hb constant spring'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Translation into globin protein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Translation initiation is the process by which the ribosome attaches itself near the 5' end of the mRNA molecule and aligns its translational machinery in a proper reading frame so that the mRNA is translated into the intended sequence of amino acids. Messenger RNA translation is an extraordinarily complex process. The rate limiting step for translation of globin mRNAs is &quot;initiation&quot;; normal translation requires an initiator methionine codon, a continuously open &quot;reading frame&quot; (ie, each three base codon read in succession downstream of the initiator codon codes for an amino acid), and a normally positioned translation termination codon or &quot;nonsense&quot; codon (UAA, UAG, UGA) which codes for no amino acid but specifies instead the place at which translation should stop.</p><p>The initiator codon (AUG) is the essential signal required to mark, for the ribosome, the precise base at which translation of succeeding triplet codons in the open reading frame should commence. Translation will stop when a nonsense codon is reached. Mutations which convert &quot;sense&quot; to &quot;nonsense&quot; codons will result in production of a truncated globin peptide which may or may not accumulate as a stable protein product.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The beta-like globin polypeptide is 146 amino acids long, not including the initiator methionine, which is cleaved during the translation; the opening reading frame must thus have 147 consecutive &quot;sense&quot; codons, or 441 bases in the open reading frame (ORF). Beta-like globin mRNAs are translated more efficiently than alpha-like globin mRNAs. This appears to reflect differences in the 5' untranslated sequences (5' UTRs) of the individual mRNAs since, if the 5' UTRs of alpha and beta globin mRNA are interchanged, their translational efficiencies change accordingly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alpha-like globins are 141 amino acids long, requiring an open reading frame of 142 codons, or 426 bases. Normal erythroid progenitors contain slightly more alpha-like globin mRNA than beta-like globin mRNA. This probably reflects the slightly longer half-lives of alpha-like globin mRNAs (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'mRNA stability'</a> above), and, possibly, a slight excess of alpha globin mRNA transcription.</p><p/><p>These differences in translation and mRNA amount appear to balance each other, so that virtually equal amounts of alpha-like and beta-like globin are synthesized in normal erythroid cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemoglobin assembly</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The final steps required for normal hemoglobin production are the post-translational assembly of the four globin chains with four heme molecules and their interaction with one another to form functioning hemoglobin tetramers and ensure their continued stability in the cell.</p><p>This process may be facilitated by the presence of two proteins, alpha-hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP), and heme-regulated eIF2alpha kinase (HRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alpha-hemoglobin stabilizing protein (AHSP) is a chaperone protein which forms a reversible complex with free alpha hemoglobin chains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], preventing the formation of free (excess) alpha chains, inhibiting the production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species, and stabilizing nascent alpha chains for hemoglobin assembly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. The physiologically relevant replacement of the chaperone AHSP protein by beta hemoglobin chains then leads to the production of the alpha-beta dimer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], two of which combine to produce the final hemoglobin tetramer, most likely non-enzymatically. Loss, decreased levels, or polymorphisms of AHSP may exacerbate beta thalassemia, a condition in which alpha chains are made in excess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/13,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18,19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heme-regulated alpha-subunit of eukaryotic translational initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha) kinase (HRI) prevents the accumulation of excess alpha- and beta-globin in the absence of heme.

However, it is the <strong>imbalance</strong> in accumulation of globin subunits that leads to formation of inclusion bodies from unpaired globin chains and the consequent pathophysiology of disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of alpha thalassemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-beta-thalassemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of beta thalassemia&quot;</a>). The discussion that follows considers only alpha and beta thalassemias in detail; delta, gamma, epsilon, and zeta thalassemias are rare and usually not associated with significant disease in adults. A few instructive exceptions will be included.</p><p>Several hundred mutations causing thalassemia have been described to date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. These affect every step in globin gene expression, including the presence and spatial arrangement of the globin gene complex, transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA translation and stability, and post-translational assembly and stability of globin polypeptides. Only a few examples illustrating each of the major categories will be included here.</p><p>Alpha and beta thalassemias will be considered together, because the genetic and molecular mechanisms are quite similar. The distinct features of these syndromes arise from the subsequent behaviors and amounts of the particular unpaired chains accumulating in each instance.

On the other hand, complete deletion of the beta globin gene has only been reported rarely, usually as part of larger gene rearrangement lesions.

In these cases, 50 to 100 kilobase long segments of DNA are deleted from downstream regions of the beta globin gene cluster. These deletions eliminate the delta and beta globin structural genes.</p><p>Persistence of very high levels of fetal hemoglobin synthesis in adult life appears to occur in those cases in which the gene deletion brings a highly active enhancer element into close apposition with the remaining gamma globin gene(s).

Discovery of this family was a major finding that helped to substantiate the critical role played by the LCR in permitting expression of the globin genes during erythropoiesis. A few additional families have been found to inherit thalassemia by a similar mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">GENE REARRANGEMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gene rearrangement events produce several distinctive and informative, forms of thalassemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57684\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57684 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Hb Lepore</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Hb Lepore syndrome arises from an unequal crossing over and recombination event between the adjacent, very closely linked (5400 bases apart), and highly homologous delta and beta globin genes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65642\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65642 \">figure 1</a>). These events fuse the 5' end of the delta globin gene (coding for amino terminus of the delta globin chain) with the 3' end of the beta globin gene (coding for the carboxy terminal region of beta globin). The result is production of a fused (delta-beta) globin polypeptide, containing delta globin amino acids in its amino terminal portion and beta globin amino acids in its carboxy terminal portion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57684\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57684 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The fused globin (delta-beta) appears to form a functional and stable hemoglobin <span class=\"nowrap\">(alpha(2)/[delta-beta](2))</span> with altered electrophoretic mobility, called Hb Lepore.

The chromosomal rearrangement eliminates any intact beta or delta locus from the chromosome, such that the recombination event precludes production of any normal beta globin from that chromosome. Unbalanced production of alpha and beta-like globin results, producing thalassemia of moderate-to-high severity in homozygotes.

It also eliminates from the recombined chromosome all of the non-coding DNA between the A(gamma) and beta genes, as well as the delta globin gene. The only globin that can be encoded by this chromosome is thus fetal Hb containing only the G(gamma) form, and Hb Kenya containing the fused (A(gamma)-beta) chain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57684\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57684 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>This event is associated with biochemical and clinical features of hereditary persistence of fetal Hb (HPFH) with the added presence of the structural variant, Hb Kenya. The persistence of high levels of fetal hemoglobin synthesis into adult life may arise because of the elimination of stage selector elements and silencers normally located between the gamma and delta genes, and the closer apposition of a strong beta globin gene enhancer normally located at the 3' side of the beta gene to the G(gamma) and Kenya genes. Hb Kenya is rare; the anti-Kenya state has not yet been identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Alpha thalassemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since each of the two copies of the normal alpha globin genes codes for exactly the same amino acid sequence, it is not possible to create structural alpha globin protein variants analogous to Hb Lepore and Hb Kenya by unequal crossover and recombination. However, direct analysis of globin gene DNA sequences suggests that fairly common forms of alpha thalassemia that appear to arise from a &quot;deletion&quot; of one copy of an alpha globin gene are actually due to unequal crossover and recombination events that fuse the two alpha globin genes together into one.</p><p>The reciprocal product, containing three alpha genes, has been found in some families. These excess alpha genes can aggravate the severity of beta thalassemia because of an even greater overproduction of alpha globin chains (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69490\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69490 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">MUTATIONS AFFECTING TRANSCRIPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Forms of both alpha and beta thalassemia have been found to arise from mutations that alter known promoter or enhancer sequences for the alpha or beta globin genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Some of these are point mutations that alter the efficiency of the promoter or enhancer, while others are small gene deletions or rearrangement that disrupt their spatial integrity. In the aggregate these mutations account for only a small percentage of the worldwide burden of thalassemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">MUTATIONS AFFECTING PRE-mRNA SPLICING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many mutations have been described that disrupt normal splicing of the mRNA precursor. Included among these are some of the most common forms of beta thalassemia and some of the more common varieties of &quot;non-deletion&quot; forms of alpha thalassemia. Only a few instructive examples shall be mentioned here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Alteration of canonical splice signals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some thalassemic splicing mutations directly disrupt the canonical &quot;splicing signals&quot; used to mark the beginning and end of each intron so that normal splicing can occur. These short sequences are absolutely required by the splicing apparatus. They signify the places at which excision of the intron, and ligation together of the flanking exons, should occur.</p><p>Certain bases in these splicing signals are absolutely &quot;invariant&quot;, such as the GT dinucleotide required at the 5' beginning of the intron and the AG dinucleotide required at the 3' end of the intron. The several bases to either side of these invariant nucleotides are consensus sequences within which alteration of the base will change the efficiency with which the site is used. Thus, mutations altering these nucleotides can abolish normal splicing or reduce it to a variable degree. Mutations that alter the consensus splice sites reduce production of alpha or beta globin mRNA; the pre-mRNA molecules which are not properly spliced appear to be catabolized rapidly, so that no abnormal mRNA products accumulate.</p><p>In a few cases, pre-mRNAs that are not spliced at the proper sites are spliced elsewhere by activation of &quot;cryptic&quot; sites, resulting in the production of structurally abnormal, usually non-functioning messenger RNAs. The molecular basis for variability with which mutations reduce the efficiency of normal splicing, or generate production of detectable abnormally spliced products, remains poorly understood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Activation of cryptic splicing sites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another class of splicing mutations, one of which produces a very common form of thalassemia in the Mediterranean basin, includes those in which the mutation activates a &quot;cryptic&quot; splice site. These mutations are not located within the consensus sites at either end of introns. Rather, base substitution, small deletions, or small insertions of DNA, can convert a site within an exon or intron that normally bears only a slight resemblance to a splice site into one containing much stronger consensus signal.</p><p>Depending upon the resulting &quot;strength&quot; of the signals, the splicing apparatus will utilize that site instead of normal site in a greater or lesser percentage of the pre-mRNA molecules being spliced. At least two spliced mRNA products result, accumulating in varying percentages, depending on the efficiency with which the cryptic site is used and the stability of the abnormally spliced product.</p><p>This mechanism is best illustrated by a form of thalassemia commonly found in Cyprus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A base substitution converts a cryptic site within the first intron of the beta globin gene into a site that is recognized as a &quot;strong&quot; splice site by the processing apparatus. Ninety percent of the pre-mRNA molecules transcribed from the mutated gene are spliced abnormally at the activated cryptic site, instead of the normal site. The mRNA product that results retains a small region (17 bases) of intron. These bases alter the reading frame or register for translation, resulting in premature translation termination. The mRNA product is useless for production of beta globin, even though it is sufficiently stable to be detected in the steady state messenger RNA of reticulocytes. Beta globin can be produced only from the small fraction (10 percent) of the mRNA molecules that are spliced at the normal position. Severe thalassemia results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Hb E: A special case</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HbE is the prototype of several rare forms of thalassemia in which abnormal splicing results both in reduced accumulation of translatable mRNA and the production of a structurally abnormal globin polypeptide. Formation of HbE is due to a single base substitution that alters the coding property of codon 26 in the beta globin gene. As a result, lysine is inserted as the 26th amino acid instead of the normal glutamic acid. This globin forms an <span class=\"nowrap\">(a(2)/beta(2)E)</span> hemoglobin with an altered mobility, called HbE.</p><p>In some regions of Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and southern China, HbE is present in 15 to 30 percent of the population. Although HbE exhibits some measurable abnormalities in thermal stability and other properties, it appears to function quite well physiologically when inherited in a simple heterozygous (HbE trait) or homozygous state, (HbE syndrome). These patients have mild-to-moderate shortening of red cell life span and mild symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=introduction-to-hemoglobin-mutations#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Introduction to hemoglobin mutations&quot;, section on 'Hemoglobin E'</a>.)</p><p>However, an individual who inherits HbE from one parent and beta thalassemia from the other (HbE-beta thalassemia) suffers from thalassemia intermedia or, occasionally, thalassemia major (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69490\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69490 \">table 1</a>). The fact that HbE interacts with beta thalassemia trait to produce a more severe form of thalassemia was puzzling until the molecular basis for this disorder was deciphered.</p><p>The severity of HbE-beta thalassemia flows from the multiple consequences of the single base change in codon 26. This base substitution activates a cryptic splice site that is sufficiently strong that about 65 percent of the pre-mRNA is spliced at that site. The abnormally spliced mRNA is not translatable, highly unstable, and does not accumulate in the cells. The remaining 35 to 40 percent of the pre-mRNA molecules are spliced at the normal site, producing a functional, translatable, and normally stable mRNA. However, it bears the base substitution at codon 26, resulting in translation of the structural protein variant, beta(E) globin, but at only 30 to 40 percent of the normal rate. The gene is thus mildly thalassemic because a stable beta globin is produced at a reduced rate.</p><p>This mechanism explains the long-standing observations that HbE trait presents clinically as a mild form of beta thalassemia trait, HbE homozygotes behave like patients with more marked, but benign thalassemia trait, while patients inheriting a combination of HbE and beta thalassemia suffer from a severe disease. It may also explain why HbE is such a common variant. It is a thalassemic allele in the malaria-rich regions of the world, where other thalassemia alleles are also highly prevalent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protection against malaria in the hemoglobinopathies&quot;, section on 'Thalassemia'</a>.)</p><p>Several other forms of both alpha and beta thalassemia have now been shown to result from molecular mechanisms analogous to that described for HbE. In most of these cases (eg, Hb Knossos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]), a structurally abnormal Hb variant is produced in reduced amounts because the majority of the pre-mRNA molecules are misspliced at an activated cryptic splice site created by the same base change encoding the altered amino acid in the structural variant. In a few cases, the globin produced has a normal amino acid sequence because the base substitution is translationally silent. A base substitution in codon 24 that does not alter amino acid coding but does activate a cryptic splice site results in a common, mild form of thalassemia in Africans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">ALTERED mRNA TRANSLATION AND STABILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations that create a premature translation termination codon (nonsense codon) account for the most common forms of beta thalassemia, in terms of numbers of patients affected. These mutations create translation stop signals prematurely, so that the complete beta globin polypeptide is never made (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73084\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73084 \">figure 3</a>). Rather, a truncated fragment of globin is produced. In the most common forms of thalassemia due to this mechanism, these globin fragments are highly unstable, resulting in the accumulation of no detectable protein from the mutated gene locus (ie, beta(0) thalassemia). As a result, patients homozygous for this defect cannot make any beta chains and suffer from a severe form of beta thalassemia.</p><p>Premature translation termination can occur by base substitution or from short insertions or deletions of DNA in an exon, producing so called &quot;frame shift&quot; mutations. Unless the inserted or deleted stretch of DNA contains a number of bases that is an exact multiple of three, so that the &quot;open&quot; translation reading frame is maintained, the insertion or deletion will cause the ribosome to begin reading the codons out of register (ie, out of the normal reading frame). One consequence of this &quot;frame shift&quot; mechanism is that the probability that a UAA, UAG, or UGA translation termination codon will be encountered in register with the shifted reading frame within 50 or so bases downstream is almost 100 percent.</p><p>In the normal reading frame, these three bases (UAA, UAG, UGA) are usually divided among two codons, and thus never &quot;read&quot; as a stop codon by the ribosome. In the shifted reading frame, the three bases will appear as a single codon and tell the ribosome to cease translation. Frame shifting is thus an alternative molecular pathway to premature translation termination. It accounts for a number of both alpha and beta thalassemia mutations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsense-mediated decay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physiologic consequences of translation termination are very clear; no functioning globin is produced and thalassemia results. Less obvious is the phenomenon that these prematurely terminated mRNAs accumulate in greatly reduced amounts. It is not obvious why accumulation should be impaired, since their transcription, processing, and stability elements are intact. A great deal of work has shown that there are normal cell defense mechanisms to eliminate abnormally translated mRNAs. They probably exist in order to guard against the accumulation of truncated protein products, which have the potential to interact abnormally with other proteins and damage cells. This protective phenomenon is called nonsense-mediated decay and was first described for the globin genes.</p><p>Curiously, premature stop codons that occur in the final exon of either the alpha or beta globin gene accumulate at nearly normal levels. Moreover, the truncated polypeptides also accumulate stably and in significant amounts. It appears that the process of nonsense-mediated decay affects only those mRNAs in which the premature stop codon occurs in the first or second exons. This has been found in other gene systems as well. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that nonsense-mediated decay and mRNA splicing are interactive processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Dominant thalassemia trait due to nonsense codons in the final exon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The consequences of the failure of nonsense-mediated decay to reduce the accumulation of mRNAs carrying nonsense codons in the final exon are illustrated by the instructive phenotype associated with these mutations. In a few families with either alpha or beta thalassemia, patients with clinical manifestations of thalassemia intermedia are in fact &quot;simple&quot; heterozygotes inheriting only one allele for beta or alpha thalassemia. In another words, they inherit a dominant form of thalassemia.</p><p>In every case studied, this dominance (ie, increased clinical severity of the heterozygous state) appears to be due to the fact that premature translation termination in the third exon results in the production of a truncated globin polypeptide that is sufficiently stable to form hemoglobin tetramers which are highly unstable. The tetramers precipitate, forming inclusion bodies and all of the downstream derangements associated with thalassemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. The globin peptides that prematurely terminate in the third exon thus behave as dominant negative mutations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">FAILED TRANSLATION TERMINATION: Hb CONSTANT SPRING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hb Constant Spring is a prototype of several mutations, some relatively common, in which altered translation and mRNA stability interact to produce severe thalassemia. Hb Constant Spring results from a single base substitution that converts the normal UAA translation termination codon in the alpha globin mRNA into a &quot;sense&quot; codon coding for an amino acid. As a result, the ribosome &quot;reads through&quot; the normal termination site and adds another 31 amino acids before it encounters an in frame stop codon in the normally 3' untranslated region.</p><p>The elongated alpha globin polypeptide (alpha(CS)) that results from this abnormal translation event is functional and relatively stable, although it becomes modestly foreshortened by proteolysis during the life span of the red cell. However, very little (alpha(CS)) globin is produced, usually only 1 to 5 percent of the normal output from the alpha globin gene. This thalassemic behavior occurs because the amount of (alpha(CS)) mRNA is dramatically reduced, due to its marked instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Sequence elements in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of normal alpha globin mRNA are critical for its extraordinary stability. These elements are situated within the region that is &quot;read through&quot; in (alpha(CS)) mRNA by the ribosome as a result of the loss of the termination codon. This read through phenomenon disrupts the ability of stability elements to interact with their cognate binding proteins, resulting in the destabilization of the alpha(CS) globin mRNA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66545\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66545 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p>Hb Constant Spring is a very common form of the alpha thalassemia in Asia. Several analogous mutations have been described. Each represents a different point mutation in the termination codon that results in a different amino acid being incorporated where translation should normally stop. In each of these cases, read through proceeds to the exact same stop signal in the 3' UTR, so that mRNA stability is affected exactly as it is for Hb Constant Spring. Other rare mutations disrupt translation termination by frame shifting. In these cases, the severity of the mRNA stability defect varies, probably depending on the point at which a new in frame termination codon is encountered, and the way in which the variable lengths of ribosomal &quot;read through&quot; interferes with the function of the 3' UTR stability elements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">POST TRANSLATIONAL MECHANISMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A few, relatively uncommon, mutations have been found that cause thalassemia by disrupting the structure of the fully translated globin product. These appear to interfere with normal folding of the globin peptide to form stable dimers or tetramers. In each case, the abnormal globin generates inclusion bodies and produces a thalassemia phenotype. Examples are Hb Indianapolis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/molecular-genetics-of-the-thalassemic-syndromes/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], which produces beta thalassemia intermedia, and Hb Quong Sze, which produces alpha thalassemia. The final common pathway for these mutations is similar to that of the dominant form of thalassemia due to nonsense codons in the final exon (see above). In both cases, substantial amounts of the abnormal protein accumulate, generating inclusion bodies by virtue of their abnormal interaction with other globin chains or heme.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thalassemias arise from well over 100 mutations that, in the aggregate, affect every step required for successful production of the large amounts of Hb needed for normal red cell homeostasis. The mutations accounting for most of the thalassemia patients around the world are those affecting translation termination and mRNA splicing. Gene deletions and rearrangements, and defects affecting transcription, mRNA stability, or Hb assembly are uncommon.</p><p>However, this later group of mutations has been highly informative, because their study has uncovered mechanisms that are highly relevant to the pathophysiology of a number of congenital and acquired disorders. Study of thalassemia, because of the extraordinarily well-characterized structure, function, and pathology of the globin gene complexes, continues to serve as a paradigm for the study of molecular medicine in general.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Steinberg MH, Benz EJ Jr. Pathobiology of the human erythrocyte and its hemoglobins.
