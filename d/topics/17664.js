Several benzodiazepines are used, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprazolam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triazolam</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxazepam</a>. Selection among them is generally based on the efficacy and pharmacokinetics of individual agents, as well as the clinician&rsquo;s experience. (See <a href=\"#H876469\" class=\"local\">'Benzodiazepines'</a> below.)</p><p>When immediate relief of anxiety is desired, benzodiazepines with a rapid onset of action are favored. For outpatient procedures that require a faster recovery time, benzodiazepines with a shorter duration of action after a one-time dose are generally favored. </p><p>For surgical or invasive procedures where intravenous access and close monitoring are available, we favor first-line use of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> for acute procedural anxiety over other medications. Midazolam has a rapid onset, short duration of effects, amnestic properties, tolerable side effects, and is acceptable to patients. (See <a href=\"#H1728948555\" class=\"local\">'Midazolam'</a> below.)</p><p>Most clinical trials comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> with placebo and other benzodiazepines for procedural anxiety found that midazolam had similar or better efficacy compared with other benzodiazepines and was preferred by patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-procedural-anxiety-in-adults/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. As an example, a clinical trial of 63 patients undergoing bronchoscopy in Czechoslovakia found intravenous midazolam 0.07 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> had stronger sedating and anxiolytic effects than intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> 0.14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-procedural-anxiety-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]<strong>. </strong>Midazolam was more likely to cause anterograde amnesia, which is desirable for conscious sedation in bronchoscopy. More patients treated with midazolam reported acceptability of future bronchoscopy. Midazolam is also the most strongly supported benzodiazepine in clinical trials comparing the benzodiazepine with placebo. (See <a href=\"#H133953437\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>For minor outpatient procedures where intravenous access is not usually indicated or close monitoring is not readily available, we favor first-line treatment with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a>. Diazepam has a rapid onset of action and short duration of effect with one-time dosing. Clinical trials suggest that diazepam is more efficacious in procedural anxiety compared with placebo, but has shown mixed results in comparisons with other benzodiazepines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-procedural-anxiety-in-adults/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. As an example, a clinical trial of 90 women undergoing minor gynecological surgery in England found diazepam 10 mg orally to be more effective than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triazolam</a> or placebo in anxiolytic effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-procedural-anxiety-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1080329656\" class=\"local\">'Diazepam'</a> below.)</p><p>Despite clinical trials showing efficacy in procedural anxiety, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> has led to widely variable clinical results. Oral (tablet and liquid) formulations of the drug have limited availability in some countries.</p><p>Oral benzodiazepines given the morning of surgery should be timed 30 to 90 minutes prior to the surgery. Intravenous medication should be reserved as in-hospital premedication for surgical procedures in which there is immediate and adequate airway support. (See <a href=\"#H225831150\" class=\"local\">'Administration'</a> below.) </p><p>Particular conditions may favor other benzodiazepines. As an example, for procedures or patients who need pretreatment or anxiety more than two hours prior to a procedure (for example, at home prior to the hospital), we would favor a benzodiazepine with a more intermediate onset and intermediate duration of action such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>. When minimal recall of the details of a procedure is desirable, such as prior to induction of anesthesia, extraction of molars in dental surgery, or bronchoscopy, we favor a benzodiazepine with a stronger amnestic effect such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>.</p><p>A table provides information on the pharmacology and dosing of commonly used benzodiazepines in treatment of procedural anxiety (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F71754\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71754 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>For patients with hepatic insufficiency, we favor treatment with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temazepam</a> or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oxazepam</a> and lorazepam are reasonable alternatives for oral administration. All three agents are metabolized by glucuronide conjugation and are excreted unchanged by the kidney. Glucuronidation is less affected by hepatic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-procedural-anxiety-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. If a faster recovery time is desired, oxazepam or temazepam are a better choice rather than lorazepam. Lorazepam has a longer duration of clinical effects, at least six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-procedural-anxiety-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], which makes discharge more difficult. The clinical effects of sedation or psychomotor impairment resolve within two hours of administration of oxazepam and temazepam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-procedural-anxiety-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Women undergoing an abortion procedure or gynecological or breast surgery have responded to oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> more variably compared with other benzodiazepines. These patients may require intravenous midazolam, intravenous diazepam, or a higher oral dose of midazolam (at least 10 mg) for treatment of procedural anxiety. This may be due to higher baseline procedural anxiety in women. A clinical trial of 60 patients in Taiwan found that procedural anxiety was higher in women compared with men and younger compared with older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-procedural-anxiety-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>A 50 percent dose reduction is suggested in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-procedural-anxiety-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Older than 60</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Debilitated</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Low cardiac output</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Premedicated with opioid analgesics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hepatic insufficiency (for benzodiazepines other than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxazepam</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temazepam</a>)</p><p/><p>No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency.</p><p>A substance use disorder is generally not considered a contraindication to one-time use of a benzodiazepine for acute procedure anxiety, as long as the patient is not acutely intoxicated with another sedating substance at the time of the procedure and <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> is closely monitored for respiratory depression. Patients with regular alcohol or benzodiazepine use leading to tolerance may require a higher-than-usual benzodiazepine dose. </p><p>For patients who are not able to tolerate benzodiazepines, have medical contraindications to their use, or have found them ineffective, we suggest treatment of procedural anxiety with sublingual melatonin at 3 mg. If no effect after 30 to 60 minutes, a repeat dose may be given. (See <a href=\"#H35065952\" class=\"local\">'Melatonin'</a> below.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gabapentin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> have also shown evidence of efficacy in clinical trials, but have been subject to less study and clinical experience. (See <a href=\"#H3222461997\" class=\"local\">'Other medications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2418748346\"><span class=\"h4\">Psychotherapy preferred or indicated</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients receiving psychosocial treatment for acute procedural anxiety, we suggest first line treatment with brief CBT rather than other interventions. Brief CBT is supported by clinical trials and our clinical experience. Less robust evidence supports the efficacy of music therapy, video observation, and spiritual training. No trials compare psychosocial interventions. (See <a href=\"#H87642297\" class=\"local\">'Brief cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H877209\" class=\"local\">'Music therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H877539\" class=\"local\">'Video observation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H35066269\" class=\"local\">'Spiritual training'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2199738989\"><span class=\"h2\">Insufficient response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients may not respond sufficiently to an initial benzodiazepine dose, requiring one or more repeat doses. As an example, about a quarter of the patients receiving sedation prior to a hospital procedure required a second medication dose because of either an inadequate response to the first dose or a prolonged procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-procedural-anxiety-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In cases where multiple doses are needed, patients should be monitored closely for excessive sedation and respiratory depression. Oral dosing may be repeated after 30 minutes to one hour if the initial dose has no effect. Peak plasma level following oral administration is reached within 60 minutes for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazepam</a> and within 120 minutes for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alprazolam</a>.</p><p>Intravenous dosing may be titrated using small increments to desired effect, evaluating its effects two minutes following an increased dose, and not exceeding the maximum recommended total dosage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F71754\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71754 \">table 1</a>). To maintain the drug&rsquo;s effects, additional doses of 25 percent of total initial dose may be administered if needed for longer procedures. (See <a href=\"#H225831150\" class=\"local\">'Administration'</a> below.) </p><p>For patients who do not respond adequately to brief CBT, consider additional sessions to address underlying fear that might not have been evident during brief treatment, or referral to a mental health professional to reevaluate the patient for a co-occurring depression or other anxiety disorder that may contribute to the procedural anxiety. Another option is treatment with a benzodiazepine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7713871\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical trials have found most benzodiazepines and melatonin to be efficacious in the treatment of acute procedural anxiety. Initial clinical trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> and the beta-blocker <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> in procedural anxiety have shown promising results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H876469\"><span class=\"h2\">Benzodiazepines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benzodiazepines enable patients with acute procedure anxiety to tolerate procedures by reducing anxiety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inducing sedation. The use of benzodiazepines for this purpose is common in the United States, though their use may vary nationwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-procedural-anxiety-in-adults/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. All benzodiazepines have similar mechanism of action and clinical effects including hypnotic, sedation, anxiolytic, and amnestic effects. Pharmacokinetic properties among the agents vary considerably, influencing selection among benzodiazepines, including rate of onset affecting peak plasma drug levels, metabolism, drug distribution and elimination half-life, affecting the duration of effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-procedural-anxiety-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H133953437\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on a limited number of clinical trials and our clinical experience, most benzodiazepines appear effective in reducing acute procedural anxiety <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inducing sedation, increasing a patient&rsquo;s comfort during the procedure, enabling the completion of clinical procedures, and increasing patients&rsquo; willingness to repeat the procedure in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-procedural-anxiety-in-adults/abstract/24,27-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27-31</a>].

Clinical trials have found that supplemental education increased patients&rsquo; knowledge about a procedure but have been mixed with regard to its effect on patients&rsquo; anxiety about the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-procedural-anxiety-in-adults/abstract/71-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">71-77</a>]. As an example, in a trial of 140 patients undergoing endoscopy, patients who were provided with additional detailed written and verbal information related to the procedure reported a lower mean anxiety level compared with patients in usual care who received brief information about the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-acute-procedural-anxiety-in-adults/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Trials vary in the procedures studied and the quantity, quality, and mode of education provided. These factors, along with methodologic shortcomings of the trials, limit the conclusions that can be drawn.

Avoidance of clinical procedures due to acute procedural anxiety can have negative health consequences. (See <a href=\"#H1822698\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In mild cases of acute procedure anxiety, providing accurate data and realistic evaluation of the risks is often sufficient to decrease anxiety. Moderate or severe anxiety may require intervention with medication or psychotherapy to reduce distress or overcome avoidance. (See <a href=\"#H847524395\" class=\"local\">'Need for treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Either medication or a psychosocial intervention can be used first-line to treat acute procedure anxiety.

The duration without driving depends on time for resolution of these effects, which is affected by dosage, route of administration and drug potency. (See <a href=\"#H1243377192\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients receiving psychosocial treatment for acute procedural anxiety, we suggest first-line treatment with brief cognitive-behavioral therapy rather than other interventions (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Less robust clinical trials also support the efficacy of music therapy, video observation, and spiritual training in reducing anxiety prior to clinical procedures.
