The annual incidence of bacterial pneumonia in HIV-seropositive patients ranges from 5.5 to 29 per 100, compared with 0.7 to 10 per 100 in HIV-seronegative patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. In developed countries, bacterial pathogens account for a majority of respiratory infections in HIV-infected individuals, particularly as <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> incidence has declined profoundly since the introduction of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR PNEUMONIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although bacterial pneumonias can occur throughout the course of HIV infection, they occur more frequently in individuals with advanced immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A direct relation between the CD4 count and the incidence of bacterial pneumonia was noted in a 2006 report: 4.9, 8.7, and 17.9 episodes occurred per 100 patient years with respective CD4 counts of &gt;500, 200 to 500, and &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>HIV infection is also a risk factor for recurrent pneumococcal pneumonia and bacteremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Among HIV&ndash;infected patients, injection drug users, inner city inhabitants, smokers, and persons from developing countries are at highest risk for bacterial pneumonias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2,3,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of ART on incidence of pneumonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The widespread use of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the United States has reduced the incidence of pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,12</a>]. In one study from Johns Hopkins, 1898 HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> were examined from 1993 through the first six months of 1998 and had the following significant results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of bacterial pneumonia decreased progressively from 1993 to 1996 and 1997 (22.7 versus 12.3 and 9.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">episodes/100</span> person-years, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multivariate model, use of ART was associated with a 45 percent reduction in the risk for bacterial pneumonia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depressed CD4 counts, a prior episode of <em>Pneumocystis carinii</em> pneumonia (PCP), and injection drug use remained significant risk factors for pneumonia.</p><p/><p>The benefit of ART has also been seen in patients with higher CD4 counts. As an example, in the Strategic Timing of Antiretroviral Treatment (START) study, HIV-infected patients with CD4 counts &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> who received immediate ART had a 61 percent lower risk of serious bacterial infections (of which pneumonia was the most common manifestation) compared with participants who initiated ART when their CD4 count was &lt;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> (ie, deferred ART) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Despite the benefits of ART, certain HIV-infected patients may still be at increased risk of pneumonia. In a Brazilian cohort study of HIV-infected patients on ART, a detectable viral load, a lower CD4 cell count, and cocaine use were significantly associated with a higher risk of bacterial pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. There are also conflicting data as to whether the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease has declined with the use of effective ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/12,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16-18</a>]. </p><p>In a large randomized trial (n = 5472) of continuous versus intermittent ART (Strategies for Management of Antiretroviral Therapy; SMART), 116 participants (2.2 percent) developed at least one episode of bacterial pneumonia during a mean follow-up of 16 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The risk of pneumonia was significantly higher in patients treated with intermittent ART (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95% CI 1.07-2.25). However, current smoking habits were also a significant contributor to risk; among patients assigned to continuous ART, smokers had a threefold increased risk of pneumonia compared with nonsmokers. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Smoking'</a> below.)</p><p>The effect of ART on hospitalization has also been evaluated. An observational study of 3500 HIV-infected patients and 329,000 HIV-seronegative patients was conducted in Denmark from 1995 to 2007 to determine the incidence of hospitalization secondary to pneumonia during different time periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The incidence of hospitalizations in HIV-infected patients declined substantially from 51 per 1000 person-years during 1995 to 1996 to 20 per 1000 person-years during 2005 to 2007. Despite this decline, a positive HIV serostatus remained a strong risk factor for hospitalization, even in persons with a CD4 cell count &ge;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Smoking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Smoking, which is associated with a two- to fivefold increase in the risk of bacterial pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease in HIV-infected individuals, remains an important, modifiable risk factor in the ART era [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4,16,19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,16,19,21</a>].

In a prospective study of pulmonary infections in HIV-infected persons in Brazil that used enhanced diagnostics, an atypical pathogen (<em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> or <em>Chlamydophila pneumoniae</em>) was identified in nearly 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. <em>Legionella</em> infection is uncommon but occurs approximately 40 times more frequently in patients with AIDS than in the general population. Other uncommon infections include nocardia, pertussis, and <em>Rhodococcus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/30-32,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32,40</a>].</p><p>The risk of invasive pneumococcal disease is greater in HIV-infected patients than the general population. In a CDC-sponsored study of pneumococcal disease using data from the Active Bacterial Core (ABC) surveillance and the National Health Interview Survey, the risk of invasive disease among risk groups was highest in adults with hematologic cancer or <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Increased risk of invasive disease in HIV-infected patients may be partially explained by a predisposition for pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization. In a longitudinal cohort of 260 mother-infant pairs in Zambia, half of whom were HIV-seropositive, HIV infection was associated with an increased risk of colonization, particularly with pediatric serotypes covered by the 7-valent conjugate vaccine (RR 1.9; 95% CI 1.3-2.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Community-onset methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (CO-MRSA), usually harboring the Panton-Valentine leukocidin virulence factor, may cause rapidly progressive necrotizing pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Although cases of pneumonia caused by CO-MRSA are relatively rare, they are characterized by high rates of morbidity and mortality. Risk factors for CO-MRSA colonization include HIV infection.

Certain patterns have been associated with specific infections, although such associations are of minimal diagnostic predictive value when assessing an individual patient:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Rhodococcus equi</em>, an unusual gram-positive pathogen, has been reported as a cause of pneumonia in HIV&ndash;infected patients, generally in the setting of advanced immunosuppression. <em>R. equi</em> pneumonia is characterized by an indolent course with cavitary infiltrates, often in the upper lobes, mimicking tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/32,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,63</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper lobe consolidation with cavitation has also been observed in pulmonary nocardiosis.

In a South African study, in which 49 HIV-infected subjects with pulmonary symptoms were evaluated with both chest radiograph and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), 40 subjects (82 percent) had lesions identified on HRCT that were not identified on chest radiograph, including &quot;ground-glass&quot; infiltrates, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>Chest radiographs in patients with bronchitis and bronchiectasis are usually normal or may show only increased bronchovascular markings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].

Urinary antigen testing for <em>S. pneumoniae</em> and <em>Legionella</em> and a respiratory virus panel may also be useful, if available. Diagnostic evaluation can help determine if the presence of a particular pathogen may alter the initial choice of treatment (eg, <em>P. aeruginosa</em> in a patient with advanced AIDS).
