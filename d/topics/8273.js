It is important for the clinician to recognize the various traumatic and nontraumatic disorders that can lead to hand pain and dysfunction.</p><p>The history and evaluation of the adult with hand pain will be reviewed here. The differential diagnosis is lengthy, and this review will focus on some of the more common diagnoses. Thumb and wrist pain, as well as fractures and infections of the hand, are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-thumb-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with thumb pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-acute-wrist-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with acute wrist pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-finger-hand-and-wrist-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of finger, hand, and wrist fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hand-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hand infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Understanding the anatomy of the hand is necessary to identify the source of pain and limit the differential diagnosis. The bones of the hand include five metacarpals, two phalanges in the thumb, and three phalanges in each of the other fingers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51990\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51990 \">figure 1</a>). The joints of each finger include the metacarpophalangeal (MCP), the proximal interphalangeal (PIP), and the distal interphalangeal (DIP); the thumb has only one interphalangeal (IP) joint.</p><p>Extrinsic muscles of the hand originate in the forearm and elbow area. The extrinsic flexor tendons for each digit travel in a fibro-osseous tunnel between the distal metacarpal and the DIP joint. The superficialis tendon attaches to the middle phalanges, and the profundus tendon attaches to the base of the distal phalanges. The extrinsic extensor tendons pass over the dorsum of the wrist in six separate tunnels that are labeled as compartments.</p><p>Intrinsic muscles of the hand include the thenar, hypothenar, interosseous, and lumbricals. The thenar muscles control adduction, abduction, and opposition of the thumb; other thumb movements are controlled by forearm muscles. The interosseous and lumbrical muscles collectively flex the MCP joints while extending the IP joints, and the interosseous muscles also abduct and adduct the fingers.</p><p>The ulnar nerve provides the motor supply to the intrinsic hand muscles (other than the two radial lumbricals and the thenar muscles) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99717\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99717 \">figure 2</a>); it also provides sensation to the little finger and one-half of the ring finger (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F76075\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76075 \">figure 3</a>). The median nerve is the motor supply to many of the forearm flexor muscles as well as the thenar muscles and the two radial lumbricals in the hand (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99716 \">figure 4</a>); it is the sensory supply to the palmar aspect of the first three fingers and the radial half of the ring finger (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70720\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70720 \">figure 5</a>). The radial nerve is the motor supply to many of the extensor muscles in the forearm as well as the sensory supply to the dorsum of the hand (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F99718\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99718 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H384457\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON CAUSES OF HAND PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common causes of hand pain are presented below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Osteoarthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteoarthritis (OA) commonly affects the joints in the hand, most often in patients over 40 years of age. The most common symptom associated with hand OA is joint pain, which is typically exacerbated by activity and relieved by rest.</p><p>Osteoarthritic enlargements of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints are commonly observed and are referred to as Heberden&rsquo;s and Bouchard&rsquo;s nodes, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F81740\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81740 \">image 1</a>). The first carpometacarpal joint is another common joint affected by OA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammatory arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis are the two most common forms of inflammatory arthritis affecting the hands. The onset of inflammatory changes is usually insidious, with the predominant symptoms being pain, stiffness, and fusiform swelling of many joints. The hands are a common site of early involvement, particularly the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and PIP joints. Bilateral symmetric involvement is a characteristic feature of RA, although this may be less apparent early in the disease. Patients with RA and psoriatic arthritis are also likely to have other joint involvement as well as systemic symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Hands'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis&quot;, section on 'Patterns of arthritis'</a>.)</p><p>Gout and calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease can also affect any of the joints of the hands and wrists. Acute attacks of the microcrystalline diseases are usually characterized by severe pain, redness, warmth, and swelling of the joint. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Trigger finger (stenosing flexor tenosynovitis)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trigger finger is one of the most common causes of hand pain in adults. Patients with trigger finger initially describe snapping, catching, or locking of one or more fingers during flexion of the affected digit. These symptoms often become progressively severe and painful. Trigger finger is due to constriction of the first annular (A1) pulley (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74607\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74607 \">figure 7</a>) which overlies the MCP joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51990\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51990 \">figure 1</a>). The flexor tendon catches when it attempts to glide through a relatively stenotic sheath, resulting in an inability to smoothly flex or extend the finger. The patient rubs over the tendon in the palm or actually demonstrates the locking phenomenon when describing the condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trigger finger (stenosing flexor tenosynovitis)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Ganglion cyst</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A ganglion cyst is a benign, fluid-filled swelling overlying a joint or tendon sheath. Pain may or may not accompany the cyst. Although they are most commonly found on the wrist, they can also arise from the digital flexor tendon sheath, which has classically been described as arising from the A1 pulley of the finger. A small mass may be palpable in the flexion crease at the base of the finger, which is occasionally mildly tender. Active and passive of the digits are unimpaired.</p><p>A digital mucous (or mucinous) cyst is a ganglion cyst that forms over the dorsal side of the DIP joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F80546\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80546 \">picture 1</a>). These occur most commonly in the fifth to seventh decades and are usually associated with an underlying OA. The diagnosis is usually based upon the physical examination, and advanced imaging is rarely needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganglion-cysts-of-the-wrist-and-hand\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ganglion cysts of the wrist and hand&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Dupuytren's contracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dupuytren&rsquo;s contracture is characterized by progressive fibrosis of the palmar fascia which can lead to contractures that draw one or more fingers into flexion at the MCP joint, PIP joint, or both (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F89579\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89579 \">picture 2</a>). It occurs primarily in white males over the age of 50 and appears to have a pronounced genetic predisposition.</p><p>The incidence of Dupuytren&rsquo;s contracture is two to five times higher among workers exposed to repetitive handling tasks or vibration compared with those not exposed such trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-examination-of-the-adult-with-hand-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It also occurs more frequently in patients with diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-examination-of-the-adult-with-hand-pain/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>] and may be associated with cigarette smoking and alcohol abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-examination-of-the-adult-with-hand-pain/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Patients typically complain of painless nodular lesions on the palmar fascia, usually affecting the fourth and fifth digits, with puckering and tethering of the overlying skin. Early on in the development of nodules, some patients will report pain in that area, although the pain will typically resolve. Over time, thickening of the palmar fascia causes loss of full extension. The patient often rubs the palm and fingers in an attempt to straighten them out as the condition is described. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dupuytrens-contracture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dupuytren's contracture&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Carpal tunnel syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common nerve entrapment disorder, caused by increased pressure and consequent compression of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel. Median nerve impingement may result from diseases that invade the carpal tunnel, from swelling of tendon sheaths within the tunnel, from stenosis of the tunnel by bone enlargement, or from thickening and degeneration of the volar carpal ligament. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-etiology-and-epidemiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Etiology and epidemiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical features of CTS are variable but usually include pain and paresthesia in the thumb, the first two fingers, and the radial half of the ring finger (the distribution of the median nerve). Patients often complain of pain that wakes them up at night. Paresthesia and sensory deficits may involve the entire palm area in some cases due to variable nerve innervation or patient perception. In addition, pain, but not paresthesia, may radiate proximally into the forearm and occasionally to the shoulder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88716144\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign bone tumors such as simple bone cysts and enchondromas are relatively common in the phalanges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-examination-of-the-adult-with-hand-pain/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These are typically asymptomatic and are often diagnosed as an incidental finding on routine hand radiographs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-bone-tumors-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign bone tumors in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other soft tissue tumors can also occur in the hand and digits such as tenosynovial giant cell tumors, lipomas, and glomus tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/history-and-examination-of-the-adult-with-hand-pain/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Patients usually present with an exquisitely tender swelling at the base of the fingernail. Other superficial infections of the hands include cellulitis, lymphangitis, pulp space infections, herpetic whitlow, and abscesses. A detailed discussion of hand infections is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hand-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hand infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H379315\"><span class=\"h2\">Mallet finger</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A mallet finger refers to a loss of terminal extension of the DIP joint of the digit. It can be classified as either bony or soft tissue depending on where the disruption of the extensor mechanism of the finger occurred. The injury occurs due to acute forceful passive flexion of the DIP joint during concomitant active joint extension. These can occur with surprisingly little trauma or force involved. The finger deformity results from stretching or complete rupture of the tendon, or from rupture with an avulsion fracture of the distal phalanx. Patients describe the obvious deformity plus pain over the DIP joint as well as an inability to actively extend the joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64713\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64713 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77830\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77830 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F65406\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65406 \">picture 4</a>).

Traumatic injuries to the hand are discussed in detail in separate topics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=distal-phalanx-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Distal phalanx fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=middle-phalanx-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Middle phalanx fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proximal-phalanx-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proximal phalanx fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-finger-hand-and-wrist-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of finger, hand, and wrist fractures&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-jersey-finger\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexor tendon injury of the distal interphalangeal joint (jersey finger)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-fingertip-injuries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of fingertip injuries&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of the adult with hand pain includes a detailed history and physical examination. The history and physical examination findings determine whether additional studies should be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H385410\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history should include inquiries about hand dominance, onset of symptoms, antecedent <span class=\"nowrap\">injury/trauma</span> or occupational activities, and duration and specific localization of symptoms. A description of the intensity and quality of the pain should also be obtained. Specific activities that either aggravate or alleviate symptoms should be addressed. Timing of the pain, whether in the morning, at the end of the day, or in the middle of the night, should be noted. Patients with hand pain with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) tend to have more symptoms first thing in the morning. Pain that wakes a patient up at night might be from carpal tunnel syndrome. Pain in the joints at the end of a work day might be from osteoarthritis (OA). Whether the patient has any functional impairment is also relevant. Finally, it is important to review comorbid conditions that may contribute to or confound the diagnosis. As an example, a history of psoriasis may be helpful in sorting out the cause of distal interphalangeal (DIP) pain or swelling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H384565\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination of the hand should include inspection, palpation, range of motion, strength testing, and relevant special tests. A screening neurovascular assessment of the involved extremity should also be performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H739917\"><span class=\"h3\">Inspection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The palmar and dorsal surfaces of the hands are inspected for obvious deformity, masses, skin discoloration, joint swelling, bony enlargement, contracture, and the presence of cysts or nodules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F52133\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52133 \">picture 5</a>). The bulk of the hand muscles must also be observed, particularly for atrophy at the thenar eminence suggesting carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), or of the intrinsic muscles of the first web space and between the metacarpals suggesting ulnar nerve dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H740029\"><span class=\"h3\">Palpation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palpation can help localize a specific region with an underlying pathologic process. All of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, and DIP joints should be assessed for swelling or bony enlargement. Palpation of the tendons in the palm should be evaluated for tender nodules or thickening.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpation of the DIP and PIP joints &ndash; The DIP and PIP joints are palpated to assess for tenderness, swelling, and bony enlargement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76825\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76825 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76902\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76902 \">picture 7</a>). As an example, tenderness and bony enlargement along the margins of multiple DIP and PIP joints, rather than synovial thickening or swelling, is the key physical finding in patients with hand OA. By contrast, compressible synovial thickening and swelling of multiple PIP and MCP joints is a physical finding much more suggestive of RA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpation of the MCP joints &ndash; The individual MCP joints are palpated for swelling. They may also be squeezed to determine involvement of these joints &#160; Pain with MCP squeeze is a common in patients with RA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpation of the palmar fascia for nodularity &ndash; Palpation of the palmar fascia is used to assess for nodules or for tendon like bands limiting finger extension (referred to as cords) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F69444\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69444 \">picture 8</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dupuytrens-contracture\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dupuytren's contracture&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpation of the flexor tendon &ndash; The flexor tendon is palpated for localized tenderness, particularly at the A1 pulley area, for cyst formation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F78638\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78638 \">picture 9</a>). The majority of flexor tendon cysts associated with trigger finger (stenosing tenosynovitis) occur within one centimeter of the flexor creases at the base of the fingers.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Range of motion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Range of motion is assessed by opening and closing the hand. Testing the overall function of the hand can help distinguish a focal musculoskeletal process affecting one joint or finger from systemic rheumatologic conditions, determine the number of affected joints, and assess the severity of the condition.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opening and closing the hands &ndash; Asking the patient to open and close the hand assesses the full and smooth movement of the small joints of the hand comparing the individual fingers. Inability to flex or extend across a joint or malalignment with motion may suggest an underlying tendon disruption, displacement, or joint subluxation or dislocation. Arthritis from any cause, trigger finger, and Dupuytren&rsquo;s contracture can all affect hand movement. Angular deformities (as opposed to loss of <span class=\"nowrap\">flexion/extension)</span> are almost always related to trauma or an arthritic processes.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H741116\"><span class=\"h3\">Strength testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strength testing can include resisted motion in both flexion and extension across each joint.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resisted flexion and extension &ndash; Resisted flexion and extension of an individual joint (eg, MCP or PIP) while maintaining the other digits extended will aid in the evaluation of the function of the tendons. A complete inability to flex across one joint is more likely related to a mechanical failure of one tendon (ie, mallet finger with extensor tendon rupture) but may also occur from neurologic causes, particularly if multiple tendons in a characteristic distribution are involved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grip strength &ndash; Gripping provides an objective measurement of the integrity and strength of the intrinsic muscles of the hand and of the forearm muscles. Grip strength can be crudely estimated by manual gripping of the examiner&rsquo;s fingers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80580\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80580 \">picture 10</a>). Physical measurement using a dynamometer is more accurate and reproducible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56541\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56541 \">picture 11</a>). The differential diagnosis of reduced grip strength is quite broad and includes essentially all conditions producing pain in the hand. Therefore, reduced grip strength is only useful as a global measure of function. It is only diagnostically useful in conjunction with the rest of the clinical picture.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Special tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional maneuvers can be performed depending on the initial history and physical examination findings. We describe a few common maneuvers below. Additional maneuvers can be found in separate topic reviews.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Confirming the presence of finger triggering</strong> &ndash; The mechanical function of the affected finger is assessed in patients with suspected trigger finger to document the presence of triggering (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F63023\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63023 \">picture 12</a>). Locking or clicking with movement should be demonstrated when the patient is asked to fully open and close the hand. The locking does not have to occur with every repetition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trigger finger (stenosing flexor tenosynovitis)&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cyst transillumination </strong>&ndash; The presence of some ganglion cysts of the hand can be strongly supported by using a small penlight or laser pointer. The light is seen to travel through the cyst, illuminating it in a distinctly different way than the surrounding tissue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganglion-cysts-of-the-wrist-and-hand#H469840515\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ganglion cysts of the wrist and hand&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Provocative maneuvers for carpal tunnel syndrome</strong> &ndash; Provocative maneuvers for carpal tunnel syndrome include the Phalen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F68440\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68440 \">picture 13</a>), Tinel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F58010\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58010 \">picture 14</a>), and manual carpal compression. While these tests can be helpful when interpreted in the appropriate clinical context, their sensitivity and specificity is moderate at best. These maneuvers are described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Provocative maneuvers'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depending on the history and physical examination findings, additional studies may help identify or confirm the underlying diagnosis. Patients with persistent or chronic symptoms despite these measures or those who have systemic symptoms or more severe initial symptoms such as palpable swelling, nodularity, synovial thickening, or early joint contracture should have a more comprehensive examination for specific conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain film radiography of the hand is generally indicated in patients with joint pain and inflammation, a history of trauma, or the presence of a deformity. As examples, the diagnosis of osteoarthritis (OA) of the hands rarely requires plain radiographs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F55802\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55802 \">image 3</a>), but is indicated when the patient presents with evidence of joint swelling or synovial thickening suggestive of the presence of an inflammatory arthritis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H1598951\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Plain film radiography'</a>). In the case of a mallet finger deformity, plain radiographs may confirm avulsion fracture of the distal phalanx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64713\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64713 \">image 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extensor-tendon-injury-of-the-distal-interphalangeal-joint-mallet-finger#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extensor tendon injury of the distal interphalangeal joint (mallet finger)&quot;, section on 'Radiographic findings'</a>.)</p><p>If further detail of the bony anatomy is required, computed tomography (CT) may be considered. If detailed imaging of soft tissue anatomy is required, advanced imaging with ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indicated. However, advanced imaging is rarely needed for the vast majority of patients and typically only helpful in confirming a diagnosis based on a thorough history and physical examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H384705\"><span class=\"h2\">Injections and aspirations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aspirations and injections of the hand joints can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. Like most joints, aspiration can yield important diagnostic information; however, given their small size, there are some technical limitations to joint aspiration in the fingers and hand, and the volume of fluid obtained is likely to be very small. If joint infection is suspected, the synovial fluid should be sent for Gram stain, cell count, and culture. Diagnoses such as gout and pseudogout can be confirmed by crystal analysis with polarized microscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synovial-fluid-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synovial fluid analysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganglion-cysts-of-the-wrist-and-hand#H258351960\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ganglion cysts of the wrist and hand&quot;, section on 'Ganglion cyst aspiration'</a>.)</p><p>Ganglia and retinacular cysts can sometimes be treated with simple aspiration with varying degrees of recurrence (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganglion-cysts-of-the-wrist-and-hand\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ganglion cysts of the wrist and hand&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganglion-cysts-of-the-wrist-and-hand#H258351960\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ganglion cysts of the wrist and hand&quot;, section on 'Ganglion cyst aspiration'</a>). Patients with persistent or severe symptoms from trigger finger may benefit for a local glucocorticoid injection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigger-finger-stenosing-flexor-tenosynovitis#H376420295\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trigger finger (stenosing flexor tenosynovitis)&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoid injection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute phase reactants, particularly the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), are relatively nonspecific tests that should be limited to patients with suspected inflammatory arthritis or infection. Many patients with inflammatory arthritis will have elevated levels, although such findings lack diagnostic specificity. Acute phase reactants may also be elevated in the setting of concurrent non-rheumatologic inflammatory conditions. Normal results of acute phase reactants may occur early in the course of inflammatory rheumatic disease, especially if only a modest degree of inflammation is present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-phase-reactants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute phase reactants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with suspected rheumatoid arthritis (RA), rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody should be obtained. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H205867167\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Serology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H384712\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrodiagnostic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurodiagnostic testing includes nerve conduction studies and electromyography which should be obtained in selected patients with symptoms or signs suggestive of a neurologic disorder of the hand or upper extremity. This testing is most commonly indicated in patients with a failure to respond to initial treatment measures (eg, splinting for carpal tunnel syndrome) or for severe disease (eg, evidence of atrophy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carpal-tunnel-syndrome-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carpal tunnel syndrome: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Electrodiagnostic testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.
