Another term for secondhand smoke is &quot;environmental tobacco smoke.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287369067\"><span class=\"h1\">Does secondhand smoke cause health problems in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Studies have shown that secondhand smoke from people smoking in the home can cause health problems in children. These problems are worse if both parents smoke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287369082\"><span class=\"h1\">What health problems can secondhand smoke cause in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondhand smoke increases the chance of children having the following health problems:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing symptoms, such as coughing, coughing up mucus, or wheezing (noisy breathing)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung infections, such as bronchitis and pneumonia &ndash; These infections can be especially serious in babies and young children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asthma &ndash; Asthma is a lung condition that makes it hard to breathe. It doesn't cause symptoms all the time. But when symptoms flare up, children wheeze, cough, or get a tight feeling in their chest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lungs not growing normally during childhood</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ear infections</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hearing loss (later in childhood)</p><p/><p>Later on as adults, children who grew up with secondhand smoke are more likely to get:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asthma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other types of cancers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart disease</p><p/><p>Also, children who grow up with parents who smoke are more likely to take up smoking themselves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287369097\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child already has asthma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child already has asthma, secondhand smoke can make his or her symptoms worse or severe. Also, secondhand smoke causes children with asthma to need their asthma medicines or go to the hospital more often.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287369112\"><span class=\"h1\">Can secondhand smoke affect an unborn baby?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If a woman (who doesn't smoke) lives in a home with secondhand smoke, her baby has a higher chance of weighing less than normal at birth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287369127\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can happen if a woman smokes during pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who smoke during pregnancy have a higher chance of having a miscarriage, which is when a pregnancy ends on its own before the baby can live outside the womb.</p><p>When a woman smokes during pregnancy, her baby has a higher chance of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being born too early</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not growing as much as normal in the uterus (womb)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being born with a birth defect</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dying from sudden infant death syndrome (called &quot;SIDS&quot;) later on &ndash; SIDS is when a baby dies suddenly during sleep for no known reason.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287369142\"><span class=\"h1\">Is it enough to just make a smoke-free room in my home?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. If you want to help your child's health, you need to make your whole home smoke-free. You also need to make your car smoke-free. It will not help enough to make a smoke-free room or to smoke at home only when your child is not there. Also, using an air cleaner will not help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287369157\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do if I want to quit smoking?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to quit smoking, think of the letters in the word &quot;START.&quot; They can help you remember the steps to take:</p><p>S = Set a quit date.</p><p>T = Tell family, friends, and the people around you that you plan to quit.</p><p>A = Anticipate or plan ahead for the tough times you'll face while quitting.</p><p>R = Remove cigarettes and other tobacco products from your home, car, and work.</p><p>T = Talk to your doctor or nurse about getting help to quit.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse can help you in different ways. He or she can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put you in touch with a counselor &ndash; A counselor can help you figure out what triggers your smoking and what you can do instead.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prescribe medicines to help you quit smoking &ndash; Some medicines reduce your craving for cigarettes. Others reduce unpleasant symptoms (called &quot;withdrawal symptoms') that happen when you stop smoking.</p><p/><p>You can also get help from a free phone line (1-800-QUIT-NOW) or the website <a href=\"http://www.smokefree.gov/&amp;token=QKIBSNX8g6AhU0aUawfvSwz/fATci3Tb0gogNY35g6DdWFW7z/4PEn14RDdsVp+n&amp;TOPIC_ID=86148\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.smokefree.gov</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287369172\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-plan-and-prepare-for-a-healthy-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to plan and prepare for a healthy pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumonia in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bronchitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acute bronchitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-infections-otitis-media-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ear infections (otitis media) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-infant-death-syndrome-sids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=smoking-in-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Smoking in pregnancy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ear-infections-otitis-media-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ear infections (otitis media) in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-symptoms-and-diagnosis-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Asthma symptoms and diagnosis in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-infant-death-syndrome-sids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
