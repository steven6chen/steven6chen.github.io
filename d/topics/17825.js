Iron deficiency is a common reversible cause of anemia among peritoneal dialysis patients.</p><p>This topic reviews screening for and treatment of iron deficiency among peritoneal dialysis patients. Iron deficiency in hemodialysis patients and in nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients is discussed elsewhere.

In the United States, among 17,842 patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis in 2011, 36.5 percent received intravenous (IV) iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. By comparison, iron deficiency is present in 1 to 12 percent of individuals worldwide and in the United States. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults#H2260407746\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Iron deficiency is less common among peritoneal dialysis patients compared with hemodialysis patients. In the Medicare study cited above, 36.6 percent of peritoneal dialysis patients received IV iron compared with 74.5 percent of hemodialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Similar to hemodialysis patients, the major cause of iron deficiency in peritoneal dialysis patients is blood loss. Peritoneal dialysis patients lose approximately 1 gram of iron per year due to gastrointestinal blood loss, diagnostic phlebotomy, and procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Hemodialysis patients lose comparatively more blood through the hemodialysis procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3056345130\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gold standard for the diagnosis of iron deficiency is a bone marrow biopsy showing a lack of stainable iron in erythroid precursors and marrow macrophages. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>However, bone marrow biopsies to assess iron stores are rarely done in peritoneal dialysis patients. Instead, an estimation of iron stores is made by measurement of the serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), and ferritin and calculation of the percent transferrin saturation (TSAT), or by determination of the percentage of hypochromic red blood cells (RBCs), or by determination of the reticulocyte hemoglobin (Hb) content. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We use the serum iron, TIBC, and ferritin and calculation of the percent TSAT to estimate iron stores. Other methods are not widely available in the United States but may be more widely used in Europe.</p><p>The laboratory criteria that are used to diagnose iron deficiency are different from those in patients with relatively normal renal function. Laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of absolute and functional iron deficiency in dialysis and nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are discussed elsewhere.

The initial evaluation of anemia is generally the same for peritoneal dialysis patients as in the general population. The evaluation should include complete blood count, red blood cell (RBC) indices, reticulocyte count, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), percent transferrin saturation (TSAT), serum ferritin, serum folate and vitamin B12 levels, and testing for occult blood in stool.

Screening tests for iron deficiency include the percent TSAT, which is the plasma iron divided by TIBC x 100, and the serum ferritin concentration. The frequency of screening is discussed elsewhere.

Although most peritoneal dialysis patients with TSAT of 20 to 30 percent and ferritin 200 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> will have normal iron stores on bone marrow biopsy, many will respond to IV iron with an increase in Hb or decrease in erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/7-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of patients with mild anemia (Hb 10 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> in the absence of absolute iron deficiency (defined as TSAT &le;20 percent and ferritin &le;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL)</span> is controversial. Some clinicians treat such patients with IV iron, providing TSAT is &le;30 and ferritin is &le;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span>.

An exception may be among patients who have limited IV access and who require preservation of sites for hemodialysis access; among such patients, we may try oral iron first. This approach is consistent with the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As noted above, some clinicians also give oral iron to patients with mild anemia and a transferrin saturation (TSAT) 20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. (See <a href=\"#H3668955727\" class=\"local\">'Indications for treatment'</a> above.)</p><p>Small studies have suggested that IV iron is more effective than oral iron among peritoneal dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. In one randomized, controlled, single-center trial, 46 peritoneal dialysis patients received either IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-sucrose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iron sucrose</a> (200 mg iron), once per week for four weeks followed by once every other week for four weeks, or oral ferrous succinate, 200 mg three times per day, for eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. After four and eight weeks of treatment, the mean hemoglobin (Hb), ferritin, and TSAT were higher, and the mean ESA dose was lower in the IV compared with the oral group.</p><p>A meta-analysis that included 11 studies including 3187 patients (818 dialysis patients) showed greater efficacy (defined as Hb response &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> of IV compared with oral iron (relative risk [RR] 2.14, 95% CI 1.68-2.72) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-iron-deficiency-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].
