In a person who has CGD, some of the cells that normally fight infection do not work correctly. This makes the person likely to get many infections. These infections can be very serious. Sometimes, they even cause death.</p><p>CGD is a rare disease. It runs in families. Because CGD causes so many infections, doctors usually find it when the person with CGD is a child. CGD is more common in boys, but girls can also get it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9359498\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of CGD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumonia &ndash; This is a lung infection that causes coughing, fever, and trouble breathing. People with CGD can get pneumonia many times.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin infections &ndash; These include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cellulitis, a skin infection that causes redness, pain, and swelling</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Impetigo, a skin infection that causes red bumps on the skin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swollen lymph nodes &ndash; These are bean-shaped organs that are part of the body's infection-fighting system. There are lymph nodes behind the ears, in the neck, and in many other areas of the body. If a person is sick, lymph nodes can swell up and hurt.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abscesses &ndash; These are swollen, red, and painful areas on the skin. A common place to get these is around the rectum and anus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Digestive problems &ndash; These might include belly pain, diarrhea, or a blockage in the intestine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth problems &ndash; A child with CGD might be smaller than other children the same age.</p><p/><p>People with CGD might not have symptoms, such as a fever, even if they have severe infections. They often have infections that come back again and again. For example, a child with CGD might get pneumonia several times. Or he or she might have many skin infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9359513\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for CGD?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will ask about your child's symptoms and do an exam. He or she will order blood tests. The tests can show:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with the body's infection-fighting system &ndash; This is also called the &quot;immune system.&quot; In people who have CGD, some of the cells in the immune system do not work correctly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal genes &ndash; People with CGD have abnormal genes. A type of blood test called a &quot;genetic test&quot; can show if the genes are abnormal. If they are, this is good proof of CGD.</p><p/><p>If someone in your family had CGD, your child should have a blood test soon after he or she is born. If you are pregnant and know someone in your family had CGD, you can have tests before your baby is born. These tests can show if the baby has CGD. If doctors find CGD before a baby is born, they can make plans to prevent infections and treat the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9359528\"><span class=\"h1\">How is CGD treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; These can:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Help prevent infection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Treat any infections that happen</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow transplant (also called &quot;stem cell transplant&quot;) &ndash; This treatment can cure CGD. A bone marrow transplant is a procedure that replaces abnormal or missing cells in the bone marrow with healthy cells. The bone marrow is the tissue in the center of certain bones. Bone marrow makes blood cells.</p><p/><p>If a person with CGD gets a transplant of healthy bone marrow, this can help his or her body make new blood cells. The new blood cells from the transplant include normal infection-fighting cells. If a bone marrow transplant works, a person who had CGD can fight off infections like a healthy person.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9359543\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-marrow-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone marrow transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumonia in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellulitis-and-erysipelas-skin-infections-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cellulitis and erysipelas (skin infections) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-prevention-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pneumonia prevention in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-bone-marrow-transplantation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (bone marrow transplantation) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-and-soft-tissue-infection-cellulitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Skin and soft tissue infection (cellulitis) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
