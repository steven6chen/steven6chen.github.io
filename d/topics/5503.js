In addition to heparins and vitamin K antagonists, anticoagulants that directly target the enzymatic activity of thrombin and factor Xa have been developed. Appropriate use of these agents requires knowledge of their individual characteristics, risks, and benefits.</p><p>This topic review discusses practical aspects of the use of direct thrombin inhibitors (oral and parenteral) and oral direct factor Xa inhibitors, along with a brief mention of other anticoagulants in development. Indications and efficacy of these agents in specific clinical settings are presented in separate topic reviews on the relevant conditions.

These include platelet activation, generation of fibrin by activated coagulation factors, inhibition of procoagulant factors to prevent excessive clot propagation, and fibrinolysis to dissolve the fibrin clot as the endothelial surface is repaired (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69920\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69920 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90873\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90873 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Although these processes are often described separately, there are multiple points of overlap and crosstalk between platelets, procoagulant factors, endogenous anticoagulant and fibrinolytic factors, and the endothelium, to promote an appropriate level of hemostasis and limit clot formation to sites of vessel injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The direct thrombin inhibitors and direct factor Xa inhibitors block major procoagulant activities involved in the generation of a fibrin clot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F94856\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94856 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thrombin</strong> &ndash; Thrombin (factor IIa) is the final enzyme of the clotting cascade that produces fibrin; it is formed by the proteolytic cleavage of prothrombin by factor Xa. Thrombin has a central role in coagulation: it cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin; activates other procoagulant factors including factors V, VIII, XI, and XIII; and activates platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-oral-anticoagulants-and-parenteral-direct-thrombin-inhibitors-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The active site of the thrombin enzyme is buried deep in a groove on one side of the molecule (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97057\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97057 \">figure 4</a>); this deep groove and surrounding amino acids enhance the specificity of the enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-oral-anticoagulants-and-parenteral-direct-thrombin-inhibitors-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Exosite I is also the site of interaction of many physiologic thrombin substrates, including fibrinogen, factor V, protein C, thrombomodulin (a thrombin receptor on endothelial cells), and thrombin receptors (PAR1 and PAR4) on platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-oral-anticoagulants-and-parenteral-direct-thrombin-inhibitors-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thrombin is active in both circulating and clot-bound forms. Direct thrombin inhibitors are able to block the action of both forms of thrombin because their site of binding to thrombin is not masked by fibrin (or binding is not obstructed). In contrast, heparins are only able to inactivate thrombin in the fluid phase, via antithrombin (previously called antithrombin III) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-oral-anticoagulants-and-parenteral-direct-thrombin-inhibitors-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Factor Xa</strong> &ndash; Factor Xa acts immediately upstream of thrombin in the clotting cascade, at the convergence point of the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69920\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69920 \">figure 1</a>); it is formed by the proteolytic cleavage of factor X by one of two X-ase (ten-ase) complexes, which are made up of other procoagulant factors. Inhibition of factor Xa can prevent amplified thrombin generation because one molecule of factor Xa can cleave over 1000 molecules of prothrombin to thrombin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-oral-anticoagulants-and-parenteral-direct-thrombin-inhibitors-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Thus, advantages and disadvantages of each agent must be individualized to the patient and clinical setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F91199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91199 \">table 1</a>). Recommendations for each agent are based largely on the efficacy and safety in the specific patient population and clinical indications.</p><p>However, there are settings in which efficacy and safety of long-term oral administration are similar for vitamin K antagonists and DOACs. In such cases it may be worth considering some additional advantages and disadvantages of each class of drugs in decision making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-oral-anticoagulants-and-parenteral-direct-thrombin-inhibitors-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H829944185\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinician familiarity with dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dabigatran</a> was the first of the DOACs to become clinically available (approved in 2010 in the United States). The direct factor Xa inhibitors became available in subsequent years. However, many clinicians remain unfamiliar with the appropriate dosing of these drugs.</p><p>The lack of clinician familiarity with recommended dosing was illustrated in a 2017 report involving over 1500 patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) who were treated with a DOAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-oral-anticoagulants-and-parenteral-direct-thrombin-inhibitors-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. For initial therapy, use of a dose or dosing frequency that differed from the product labeling was common (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a>: 287 of 1591 patients [18 percent]; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apixaban</a>: 22 of 44 patients [50 percent]). There were similar degrees of deviation from the recommended doses in patients receiving long-term DOAC therapy (rivaroxaban: 14 percent; apixaban: 36 percent; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a>: 46 percent). Deviations from recommended dosing typically involved a dose or dosing frequency that was lower than recommended (eg, once-daily dosing instead of twice-daily dosing), and these deviations from recommended dosing correlated with higher rates of VTE recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 10.5). Rates of bleeding and death were not different from patients who received the correct dose.</p><p>It is often stated that clinicians should become familiar with one of the DOACs and use that drug when a DOAC is indicated. However, differences among these drugs, as described below, as well as institutional or pharmacy preferences, may make a different drug a better choice for a given patient. Thus, it is important to develop familiarity with key aspects of prescribing different agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3209078\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug adherence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug adherence appears to be relatively similar in large populations, although these may differ in some individuals or clinical settings. A set of strategies to maximize drug adherence and minimize bleeding have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-oral-anticoagulants-and-parenteral-direct-thrombin-inhibitors-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These emphasize useful ways to ask about compliance, reminders about medication storage, counseling about missed doses, planning for surgical procedures, avoidance of prescribed and nonprescription medications that interfere with platelet function (unless medially indicated), monitoring of renal function, aggressive management of hypertension, and approaches to minimizing the risk of falls.</p><p>The similar adherence to DOACs versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> was demonstrated in a meta-analysis of randomized trials (18 trials, 101,801 patients) that evaluated drug discontinuation rates in patients with VTE or atrial fibrillation (AF), who were treated for more than 12 weeks with a DOAC or a pharmacologically active comparator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-oral-anticoagulants-and-parenteral-direct-thrombin-inhibitors-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Individuals receiving a DOAC had similar rates of drug discontinuation to those receiving a vitamin K antagonist, both for VTE (13 versus 14 percent; relative risk [RR] 0.91; 95% CI 0.74-1.13) and for AF (22 percent for both types of agent; RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.87-1.17).</p><p>A review of 4863 patients who were prescribed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a> for atrial fibrillation found a median adherence rate of 74 percent (interquartile range, 66 to 80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-oral-anticoagulants-and-parenteral-direct-thrombin-inhibitors-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Adherence was higher at institutions that preselected patients for the ability to adhere to twice-daily medication and at those that provided pharmacist-based patient education and greater communication regarding medication use. Lower adherence rates could be improved by instituting these measures.</p><p>Importantly, patients prescribed a DOAC who do not or cannot take the medication as prescribed may have a greater amount of time during which they are not therapeutically anticoagulated compared with patients who miss occasional doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>. The ability to monitor the degree of nonadherence is lost when a DOAC is substituted for warfarin. As noted below, a single missed dose of a DOAC has greater potential to result in inadequate anticoagulation than a single missed dose of warfarin. (See <a href=\"#H1641059\" class=\"local\">'Settings in which a heparin or vitamin K antagonist may be preferable'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1641052\"><span class=\"h2\">Advantages over heparin and warfarin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The DOACs differ significantly from vitamin K antagonists in their onset of action, half-life, drug-drug interactions, need for monitoring, ability to monitor should this be called into question, as well as availability of antidotes in the case of excessive bleeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F91199\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91199 \">table 1</a>). In some cases, these differences may translate into similar efficacy with greater ease of administration and lower bleeding risk. However, as noted above, the efficacy and bleeding risk depend on patient variables such as compliance and interacting medications, and all decisions must be individualized to take these factors into account.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lower bleeding risk</strong> &ndash; Overall, all-cause mortality from DOACs appears to be lower than that from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, driven primarily by a decrease in fatal intracranial bleeding risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-oral-anticoagulants-and-parenteral-direct-thrombin-inhibitors-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, direct comparison of bleeding risk with different agents is challenging because risks appear to vary in different patient populations and clinical settings, and meta-analysis often combines different doses of the same anticoagulant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-oral-anticoagulants-and-parenteral-direct-thrombin-inhibitors-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This issue is discussed in detail separately.

Dose may be affected by differing bioavailability, diet, and acute medical illnesses. In contrast, the DOACs are generally used without a requirement for monitoring of drug levels or coagulation (clotting) times. This may be an advantage for patients for whom frequent monitoring is a greater burden. It remains to be determined whether laboratory monitoring of any of the DOACs can further improve their efficacy or safety. (See <a href=\"#H89174283\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing and monitoring (dabigatran)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pharmacokinetics</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Warfarin</a> pharmacokinetics is affected by the level of vitamin K intake and production in the gastrointestinal tract, as well as induction of hepatic cytochromes. Thus, warfarin effect can be altered by changes in diet, administration of other medications, gastrointestinal disorders, and reduced oral intake. Patients with difficulty controlling the prothrombin <span class=\"nowrap\">time/international</span> normalized ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">(PT/INR)</span> may benefit from a DOAC because these agents have less variability in drug effect for a given dose than vitamin K antagonists. Affected patients may include those with unavoidable drug-drug interactions (such as frequent need for antibiotics or a large number of concomitant and variable medications) or unexplained poor warfarin control. However, it is important to determine that the INR instability with a vitamin K antagonist is not due to poor compliance, which may be easier to monitor for vitamin K antagonists than for the target-specific agents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Biology</strong> &ndash; The biology of the parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bivalirudin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bivalirudin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=argatroban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">argatroban</a>) may give them advantages over heparins in certain clinical settings such as percutaneous cardiac interventions, where inhibition of clot-bound thrombin might be important; and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), where induction of an aggressive hypercoagulable state (due to anti-heparin-PF4 antibodies) must be avoided (see <a href=\"#H1640976\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> below). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dabigatran</a> was associated with a lower risk of osteoporotic fractures than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (0.7 versus 1.1 per 100 person-years) in a retrospective study of individuals with new-onset atrial fibrillation; it is not clear whether this reflects a difference in the biology of these anticoagulants or other patient factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/direct-oral-anticoagulants-and-parenteral-direct-thrombin-inhibitors-dosing-and-adverse-effects/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1641059\"><span class=\"h2\">Settings in which a heparin or vitamin K antagonist may be preferable</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several settings in which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> may be preferable to one of the DOACs, or in which a DOAC is contraindicated (eg, prosthetic heart valve, pregnancy). In addition, patients who are receiving warfarin with excellent stable INR control and minimal bleeding side effects may have little to gain by switching to a different agent. In many inpatient settings, heparins are preferable because of similar efficacy to parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors, availability of an antidote, and substantially lower costs.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prosthetic heart valves</strong> &ndash; The direct thrombin inhibitors and direct factor Xa inhibitors are <strong>not</strong> used in patients with prosthetic heart valves, due to greater risk of valve thrombosis, which may be fatal.

These drugs inactivate both circulating and clot-bound activated coagulation factors, and they do not induce antiplatelet antibodies, features that may have advantages in specific clinical settings. A major advantage of these agents is the lack of a requirement for monitoring, due to less variability in drug effect for a given dose. While the overall risks of bleeding are similar to vitamin K antagonists, the risks for intracranial bleeding are less with the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). However, the DOACs are expensive, and compliance is more difficult to monitor than vitamin K antagonists. (See <a href=\"#H1637554\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of action and terminology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1637547\" class=\"local\">'Comparison with heparin and warfarin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical indications for these agents are discussed in detail in separate topic reviews, which are listed above. Their use is not appropriate in patients with severe renal insufficiency, pregnancy, or prosthetic heart valves. (See <a href=\"#H1640976\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bivalirudin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bivalirudin</a> (Angiomax) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=argatroban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">argatroban</a> (Argatra, Novastan, Arganova, Exembol). These agents have very short half-lives and specific clinical indications such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). There are no parenteral direct factor Xa inhibitors. (See <a href=\"#H1642807\" class=\"local\">'Parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The oral direct thrombin inhibitor or oral direct factor Xa inhibitors are generally administered at fixed doses without laboratory monitoring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F112514\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112514 \">table 4</a>). Laboratory testing prior to administration of these agents should include prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), to assess and document coagulation status before anticoagulation; and measurement of serum creatinine, as a baseline and for potential dose adjustment in the event of renal insufficiency. Patients with impaired renal function should have appropriate dose reduction or drug avoidance depending on the creatinine clearance. These agents generally should be avoided in individuals with a body mass index (BMI) &gt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> or weight &gt;120 kg. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Dabigatran'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Direct factor Xa inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dabigatran</a> (Pradaxa) is the only orally active DTI available for clinical use. It must be stored in the original blister pack with desiccant and not crushed. Dosing differs in the United States versus Europe. Dose reductions are used in renal insufficiency and with concomitant P-glycoprotein inducers or inhibitors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F112756\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112756 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73326\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73326 \">table 6</a>). Risks include bleeding, thrombosis upon discontinuation, and dyspepsia. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Dabigatran'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Several orally active direct factor Xa inhibitors are available, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a> (Xarelto), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apixaban</a> (Eliquis), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edoxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edoxaban</a> (Lixiana, Savaysa), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betrixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betrixaban</a> (Bevyxxa). Rivaroxaban is administered once daily and apixaban twice daily; they interact with drugs that are potent inhibitors of both CYP-3A4 and P-glycoprotein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F112756\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef112756 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76992 \">table 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73326\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73326 \">table 6</a>). Edoxaban and betrixaban are administered once daily; these are renally excreted and are substrates for P-glycoprotein. Risks of these agents include bleeding and thrombosis upon discontinuation. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Direct factor Xa inhibitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal when transitioning between anticoagulants is to maintain stable anticoagulation. When transitioning between DOACs and a vitamin K antagonist (VKA; eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>), it is important to keep in mind that the full effect of the VKA does not occur for the first few days, and when transitioning from a VKA to a DOAC, it is important to keep in mind that the resolution of VKA effect may take several days. Specific combinations of anticoagulants are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H3776109419\" class=\"local\">'Transitioning between anticoagulants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticoagulants that inhibit other procoagulant factors are in development.
