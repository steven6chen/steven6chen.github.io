The challenge for the clinician is to identify patients with abdominal pain who may have the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious, potentially life-threatening conditions, such as an acute abdomen from appendicitis or bowel obstruction (as can occur from volvulus, intussusception, or adhesions); acute manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, hepatitis or intra-abdominal mass.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extra-abdominal infections that require specific treatment (such as streptococcal pharyngitis, urinary tract infection, or pneumonia)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unusual manifestations of less common diseases (such as Hirschsprung disease or primary bacterial peritonitis with nephrotic syndrome)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetic ketoacidosis </p><p/><p>In observational series describing children with abdominal pain evaluated in outpatient clinics or emergency departments, 22 percent had diagnoses that required surgery or treatment with antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-evaluation-of-the-child-with-acute-abdominal-pain/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Clinical experience suggests that in most outpatient settings, the proportion of children with serious conditions is lower.</p><p>Developmental considerations that must be recognized when evaluating infants and children with acute abdominal pain include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conditions that cause abdominal pain may occur more commonly at specific ages (such as volvulus among neonates and intussusception among older infants and toddlers) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65488\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65488 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants and young children often cannot describe or localize their symptoms. In addition, they may be anxious about interactions in the healthcare setting, making identification of important physical findings challenging.</p><p/><p>For most children, the etiology of abdominal pain can be identified with a careful history, either single or repeated physical examinations, and (in some cases) selective ancillary testing. Unavoidably, a small number of patients who may present early in the course of an illness (such as appendicitis) or with subtle <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> atypical signs do not receive the definitive diagnosis on the initial evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-evaluation-of-the-child-with-acute-abdominal-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Consequently, repeat examination and reliable follow-up are essential components of the evaluation and management of children with acute abdominal pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of acute abdominal pain in children are summarized here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65488\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65488 \">table 1</a>).

Typical mechanisms include motor vehicle crashes, falls, and child abuse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstruction and peritoneal irritation - These clinical features are associated with serious intraabdominal conditions that require prompt diagnosis and treatment. Conditions that cause obstruction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/</span> or peritonitis include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For neonates presenting with bilious vomiting, volvulus (as a complication of malrotation) and necrotizing enterocolitis should be considered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intussusception (invagination of a part of the intestine into itself, causing obstruction) usually occurs among children two months to two years of age. Colicky abdominal pain, usually with vomiting, is a typical feature of intussusception.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among children of all ages, appendicitis can cause peritoneal irritation and focal tenderness. It occurs most commonly in children &gt;5 years of age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Less commonly, obstruction caused by adhesions from previous surgery or inflammation, complications of Hirschsprung disease, perforated ulcer, or primary bacterial peritonitis (usually as a complication of nephrotic syndrome) may present with abdominal pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incarcerated inguinal hernia is an extraabdominal cause of abdominal pain that can be life-threatening. Myocarditis and pericarditis are rare extraabdominal causes of abdominal pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic life-threatening conditions that can be associated with abdominal pain include diabetic ketoacidosis and hemolytic uremic syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among postmenarchal females, life-threatening conditions within the reproductive tract that can cause abdominal pain include pelvic inflammatory disease with tubo-ovarian abscess and ruptured ectopic pregnancy.</p><p/><p>Common conditions that are associated with acute abdominal pain include viral gastroenteritis, systemic viral illness, streptococcal pharyngitis, lobar pneumonia, and urinary tract infections. Frequent causes of chronic or recurrent abdominal pain include colic (among neonates) and constipation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute abdominal pain in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Common causes'</a>.)</p><p>Other causes of abdominal pain include gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal conditions.

These include immunoglobulin A vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura) (usually with a distinctive purpuric rash over the lower extremities and buttock), vasoocclusive crisis with sickle cell syndromes, urolithiasis (typically with colicky pain and flank tenderness), some tumors, and toxic ingestions (such as lead or iron). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ovarian and testicular torsion, similar to volvulus and intussusception, present with pain from ischemia, often with vomiting and are genitourinary causes of abdominal pain.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first goal of the evaluation of children with abdominal pain is to identify life-threatening conditions that require emergent interventions. Once this has been accomplished, other causes of abdominal pain can often be identified through deliberate evaluation with careful attention to the clinical features of the illness (such as the child's age and gender, history of trauma, pattern of the pain, related symptoms, physical findings, and selected diagnostic studies) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57204\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef57204 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69041\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef69041 \">algorithm 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Key historical variables that may assist in identifying a specific cause of abdominal pain include history of trauma, prior abdominal surgery, fever, vomiting, location of the abdominal pain, and the pattern of symptoms. A gynecologic history (including last menstrual period and sexual activity) should be obtained for pubertal girls.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal trauma (typically sustained in motor vehicle crashes, auto-pedestrian collisions, or falls) can cause life-threatening injuries (such as solid organ injury or perforated viscus). A history of trauma may not be forthcoming for infants and children who have sustained inflicted injuries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of blunt abdominal trauma in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition#H706482351\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;, section on 'Visceral injuries'</a>.)</p><p>Although symptoms of abdominal injury typically occur immediately, they may be delayed with some injuries (such as left shoulder pain from a slowly expanding splenic hematoma, vomiting from obstruction as the result of a duodenal hematoma, or bowel perforation associated with a lap seatbelt injury). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of blunt abdominal trauma in children&quot;, section on 'Specific injuries'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Characteristics of abdominal pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants and children younger than two years of age with abdominal pain usually cannot describe or localize pain. This limitation leads to both over and under attribution of symptoms to &quot;abdominal pain.&quot; Parents may infer that the child has abdominal pain from symptoms such as drawing the legs up or inconsolability. The preschool child may be able to describe pain and other symptoms, although descriptions may not be consistently reliable. Above five years of age, children can typically characterize the onset, frequency, duration, and location of their symptoms.</p><p>Specific diagnoses may be associated with the following characteristic patterns of pain:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appendicitis &ndash; Periumbilical, migrating to the right lower abdomen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appendiceal rupture (early), ovarian torsion &ndash; Acute, severe, focal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intussusception &ndash; Intermittent, colicky</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastroenteritis &ndash; Diffuse or vague</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis and cholecystitis &ndash; Right upper quadrant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastritis, gastric ulcer disease &ndash; Epigastric</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pancreatitis &ndash; Steady periumbilical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subxiphoid pain, often radiating to the back</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal stone &ndash; Flank pain radiating to mid to lower lateral abdomen</p><p/><p>For children with localized peritoneal irritation (as with advanced appendicitis), pain can be aggravated by movement (such as, coughing, hopping, traveling in the car or walking). In comparison, patients with visceral pain may writhe with discomfort. Improvement in pain after a bout of emesis may occur with conditions localized to the small bowel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-evaluation-of-the-child-with-acute-abdominal-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].
