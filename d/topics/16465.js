This topic review will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of accelerated immunotherapy schedules and the indications for their use and will provide several specific examples of protocols that have been used successfully for aeroallergen SCIT. There are few data addressing how frequently accelerated schedules are used by allergy specialists in different areas of the world. Traditional SCIT schedules and accelerated schedules for Hymenoptera SCIT are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scit-standard-schedules-administration-techniques-and-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;SCIT: Standard schedules, administration techniques, and monitoring&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rush and ultra-rush venom immunotherapy for Hymenoptera allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11674182\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SCIT is divided into two phases: build-up and maintenance. Accelerated schedules of immunotherapy involve shortening the length of the build-up phase, while the maintenance phase remains the same.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The build-up phase involves serial injections of increasing amounts of allergen. During this phase, tolerance to the allergen is gradually induced, and the patient's immune response to the allergen is modified from a T helper type 2 (Th2) phenotype to a T helper type 1 (Th1) phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-aeroallergen-immunotherapy-accelerated-schedules-cluster-and-rush/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In conventional SCIT schedules, the build-up phase involves one or two injections per week and lasts three to six months. Conservative and moderate examples of conventional SCIT schedules are shown (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60803\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60803 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72555\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72555 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The maintenance phase of SCIT involves ongoing injections of an immunizing dose of allergen, usually at intervals of three to six weeks. During the maintenance phase, the immune transformation becomes complete. This phase is usually extended for a period of three to five years because shorter durations of treatment are associated with an increased likelihood of symptomatic relapse once therapy is discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-aeroallergen-immunotherapy-accelerated-schedules-cluster-and-rush/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p>The length of the build-up phase depends upon the frequency of the injections and the incremental dose increase between consecutive injections. Thus, accelerated schedules involve administering more injections per visit, increasing the dose more between consecutive injections, or both.</p><p>Accelerated schedules generally fall into one of two categories:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11675165\"><span class=\"h2\">Cluster schedules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cluster schedules involve the administration of several injections (two to three) of increasing dose at 30-minute intervals in one day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F69088\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69088 \">table 3</a>). The patient typically returns on one or more <strong>nonconsecutive</strong> days, several days per week. Two days per week is a common approach, although up to four days per week (ie, every other day) is also possible. Maintenance is achieved in four to eight weeks, depending upon the spacing of the visits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11675181\"><span class=\"h2\">Rush schedules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rush schedules involve administering injections of increasing dose at 15- to 60-minute intervals over one to three consecutive days until a target dose (usually slightly less than the maintenance dose) is achieved. The remainder of the build-up phase proceeds using a traditional schedule until maintenance is achieved, usually in less than eight weeks.</p><p>Ultra-rush immunotherapy is an even more rapid dosing schedule for immunotherapy, in which an effective maintenance dose is reached within one day. Ultra-rush is usually applied to Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy. Accelerated forms of venom immunotherapy are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rush and ultra-rush venom immunotherapy for Hymenoptera allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H712008851\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVANTAGES OVER CONVENTIONAL IMMUNOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Predictable advantages of accelerated schedules include increased patient convenience and more rapid induction of clinical benefit:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Greater convenience</strong> &ndash; Inconvenience is the most common reason patients discontinue conventional immunotherapy. Accelerated schedules involve fewer office visits and usually result in improved compliance with therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>More rapid onset of clinical benefit</strong> &ndash; Accelerated schedules induce the immunologic changes that occur during the build-up phase more rapidly than conventional schedules. Thus, patients experience clinical benefit sooner.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reduced risk of dosing errors</strong> &ndash; Dosing errors are one of the leading causes of systemic allergic reactions during SCIT. Rush schedules involve fewer doses overall during the build-up phase, and these doses are administered over a more concentrated time period, so dosing errors are reduced.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reduced cost </strong>&ndash; Rush schedules (although not cluster) involve fewer total injections and so can be less costly.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2636983603\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for SCIT (of any type) are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous immunotherapy for allergic disease: Indications and efficacy&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p>The indications for <strong>accelerated</strong> SCIT specifically are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A desire by the patient to increase convenience of the immunotherapy process, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A desire by the patient to experience clinical benefit sooner than would be possible with a conventional schedule</p><p/><p>Multiple studies have demonstrated that clinically significant reduction in allergic symptoms is apparent shortly after reaching maintenance in patients receiving accelerated immunotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-aeroallergen-immunotherapy-accelerated-schedules-cluster-and-rush/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3564496976\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accelerated forms of immunotherapy should not be recommended to patients who are at increased risk for developing systemic allergic reactions in response to the injections or who have comorbid medical conditions that would reduce their chances of surviving anaphylaxis. Accelerated protocols are not appropriate for patients with any of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Poorly controlled asthma</strong> &ndash; Poorly controlled asthma is one of the leading risk factors for developing a systemic allergic reaction during immunotherapy. Patients whose forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) &le;70 percent of predicted should not undergo accelerated immunotherapy, and studies have demonstrated that exclusion of these patients reduces the rate of systemic allergic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-aeroallergen-immunotherapy-accelerated-schedules-cluster-and-rush/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Clinical discretion is required in deciding to treat patients with FEV<sub>1</sub> values of 70 to 80 percent of predicted, as data are limited about this group, whereas those with an FEV<sub>1</sub> &ge;80 percent may safely be included.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Increased sensitivity to the allergens to be administered</strong> &ndash; A careful clinical history is probably the best way to detect patients with extreme sensitivity. Most studies have not found a correlation between the size of reaction on skin testing and likelihood of systemic allergic reactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medical conditions, other than asthma, which would impair the patient's ability to survive anaphylaxis or treatment for anaphylaxis</strong> &ndash; These conditions include cardiovascular disease and other pulmonary diseases.</p><p/><p>Accelerated immunotherapy is also avoided in young children (under the age of five years) because higher rates of systemic allergic reactions were reported in this age group in at least one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-aeroallergen-immunotherapy-accelerated-schedules-cluster-and-rush/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26044984\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF SYSTEMIC ALLERGIC REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary disadvantage of accelerated immunotherapy schedules with aeroallergens is the increased risk of systemic allergic reactions during the condensed build-up phase. There are no convincing data that one type of aeroallergen is better tolerated than another (eg, perennial allergens versus pollens) in accelerated protocols.</p><p>Accelerated schedules for aeroallergen SCIT are associated with higher rates of systemic allergic reactions compared with conventional schedules, although most reactions are mild. The use of premedications can significantly reduce the incidence of systemic allergic reactions, but even with premedication and the fact that low-risk patients are generally chosen for accelerated protocols, systemic allergic reaction rates are higher than those of conventional schedules. In general, the most accelerated protocols have the highest rates of systemic allergic reactions.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic allergic reactions occur in up to one-third of patients treated with rush protocols, even with premedication and careful patient selection, although most are mild. Specific protocols and reaction rates are reviewed below. (See <a href=\"#H26045151\" class=\"local\">'Specific protocols (including premedications and safety)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic allergic reactions occur in up to 6 percent of patients in most studies of cluster protocols. This rate is similar to that seen with most conventional SCIT protocols using traditional weekly build-up schedules and multiple allergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-aeroallergen-immunotherapy-accelerated-schedules-cluster-and-rush/abstract/8-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-14</a>]. Systemic allergic reactions induced by SCIT using conventional schedules and risk factors for these reactions are reviewed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-induced-by-subcutaneous-allergen-immunotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis induced by subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>With both accelerated and conventional schedules of SCIT, the risk of systemic allergic reactions is greatest during the build-up phase. The vulnerability seen during this initial phase has been attributed to the fact that the patient is exposed to even more of the allergen than at baseline because he or she is receiving it through the immunotherapy in addition to natural exposure before immunologic protection has been achieved. Therefore, shortening the build-up phase would be desirable in theory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-aeroallergen-immunotherapy-accelerated-schedules-cluster-and-rush/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, giving the same amount of allergen in a shorter period of time necessitates a more intense exposure, and patients are variable in their ability to tolerate this.</p><p>Systemic allergic reactions with accelerated protocols are uncommon following the first few injections. Instead, they tend to occur in the final doses of the 1:10 volume per volume <span class=\"nowrap\">(v/v)</span> strength or in the 1:1 <span class=\"nowrap\">v/v</span> strength (if the protocol extends into this strength).</p><p>A 2016 retrospective review of 11,982 patients compared systemic allergic reaction rates over five years for 9229 patients in a private allergy practice who received weekly build-up, 2576 who received nine-visit cluster, and 177 who were given two-day rush [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-aeroallergen-immunotherapy-accelerated-schedules-cluster-and-rush/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The cluster patients were premedicated with 20 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, H1 antihistamine (dose not specified), and 10 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">montelukast</a>. The two-day rush patients were premedicated with 40 mg prednisone, H1 and H2 antihistamine (dose not specified), and 20 mg of montelukast. With the weekly, cluster, and two-day rush protocols, systemic allergic reactions occurred in 2.8, 2.5, and 12 percent of patients, respectively, and 0.01, 0.06, and 0.33 percent of injections, respectively.</p><p>A large prospective study of 1152 patients (ages 3 to 63 years) compared the rates of systemic allergic reactions with a three-day rush schedule to those of a cluster schedule (ie, nine injections administered in six visits over two weeks) using a lyophilized dust mite extract. In addition, the impact of premedication, exclusion of patients with reduced forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), and adjustment for large local reactions were examined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-aeroallergen-immunotherapy-accelerated-schedules-cluster-and-rush/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Subjects were premedicated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>, long-acting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketotifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketotifen</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a>. Among patients receiving dust mite extract, 36 percent had a systemic allergic reaction using a three-day rush schedule without premedication compared with 16 percent in the premedicated group. Systemic allergic reactions decreased to 7.3 percent when patients with FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;70 percent of predicted were excluded and when the protocol was modified for large local reactions (&gt;10 cm). Systemic allergic reactions occurred in 5.4 percent of those receiving the cluster schedule. Children under five years of age experienced greater rates of systemic allergic reactions than older patients, leading the authors to conclude that accelerated immunotherapy is not appropriate in this age group. (See <a href=\"#H3564496976\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p>Additional studies are reviewed below within the discussion of each type of accelerated schedule. (See <a href=\"#H26045151\" class=\"local\">'Specific protocols (including premedications and safety)'</a> below.)</p><p>When comparing different studies, it is important to realize that each protocol has several variables: the number of allergens administered, the type of accelerated protocol, the target dose (how close to maintenance the schedule aims to achieve), the premedication regimen, and the way in which systemic allergic reactions were measured. These details are reviewed with each study below. (See <a href=\"#H26045151\" class=\"local\">'Specific protocols (including premedications and safety)'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17982574\"><span class=\"h2\">Interventions to reduce risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interventions to reduce the risk of systemic allergic reactions during accelerated immunotherapy include careful selection of patients, the use of premedications, and avoidance of initiation during peak pollen seasons in patients being treated with pollen allergens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1031688708\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest accelerated immunotherapy only to patients who are at relatively low risk for developing systemic allergic reactions to immunotherapy. We exclude patients who are unusually sensitive to one or more of the indicated allergens, have uncontrolled asthma, or have other comorbidities that would put them at risk for a poor outcome if a systemic allergic reaction were to develop. Contraindications to accelerated immunotherapy are discussed above.

We suggest the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients undergoing <strong>cluster</strong> immunotherapy should receive an H1 antihistamine prior to each injection visit. Many studies have used <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loratadine</a> administered anywhere from 15 minutes to 2 hours prior to injections (peak serum concentrations of loratadine are achieved 60 to 90 minutes after dosing). (See <a href=\"#H16818310\" class=\"local\">'Cluster schedules'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to starting a patient on rush immunotherapy (RIT), it is widespread practice to administer a glucocorticoid, in addition to an H1 and H2 antihistamine. Some protocols additionally call for antileukotriene agents. Different regimens have not been compared head-to-head. Premedications are usually administered for three days prior to the start of the protocol. Specific regimens that have been used successfully with certain protocols are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H26045159\" class=\"local\">'Rush schedules'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10034566\"><span class=\"h4\">H1 antihistamines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a randomized trial designed specifically to study the impact of premedication with an H1 antihistamine on the safety of cluster SCIT, 45 adults were treated with either birch or Timothy grass aluminum hydroxide (slow-release) extracts, using a seven-week cluster protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-aeroallergen-immunotherapy-accelerated-schedules-cluster-and-rush/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. All patients had seasonal allergic rhinitis, and about 10 percent also had asthma. Subjects received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loratadine</a> (10 mg orally) or placebo two hours before each visit. Findings included the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were significantly more systemic allergic reactions in the placebo group (79 versus 33 percent of patients).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The systemic allergic reactions in the placebo group were more severe (28 versus 6 percent of reactions were grade 3, which consisted of urticaria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> asthma), although there were no life-threatening systemic allergic reactions in any of the patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were significantly more dose reductions due to systemic allergic reactions in the placebo group compared with the premedication group (25 versus 9 reductions).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were no differences between the two groups in the time to onset of systemic allergic reactions, suggesting that premedication did not delay the appearance of symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More patients in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loratadine</a> group reached the maintenance dose (95 versus 71 percent).</p><p/><p>There is some evidence that H1 antihistamines may enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-aeroallergen-immunotherapy-accelerated-schedules-cluster-and-rush/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A proposed mechanism is that reduction of systemic histamine levels secondarily decreases levels of other immune modulators and shifts the immune response away from an allergic response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10034600\"><span class=\"h4\">Combination regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small randomized trial evaluated the impact of premedication with a combination of agents or with placebo alone on 22 children undergoing a two-day rush protocol with different aeroallergens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-aeroallergen-immunotherapy-accelerated-schedules-cluster-and-rush/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients in both groups received an average of 26 to 28 allergens in their immunotherapy solutions. Premedications were administered for three days, beginning one day prior to the two treatment days. Premedication consisted of astemizole (an H1 antihistamine that is no longer available), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> (H2 antihistamine), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>. Children &ge;12 years of age received 15 mg astemizole twice daily for one day, followed by 10 mg twice daily the next day, and 5 mg twice daily on the third day. They also received prednisone (30 mg twice daily) and ranitidine (150 mg twice daily) on all three days. Younger children received age- and weight-adjusted doses. Seventy-three percent of children in the placebo group experienced systemic allergic reactions, compared with 22 percent in the premedication group, and the reactions were more severe, although all responded to treatment. The systemic allergic reactions began between 30 and 120 minutes after the injections, and the most common eliciting dose was 0.3 mL of 1:10 <span class=\"nowrap\">v/v</span>. The incidence of local reactions was also reduced by premedication.</p><p>Following this study, most subsequent studies of rush protocols have used combinations of H1 antihistamines and glucocorticoids for premedication. Some also include H2 antihistamines and antileukotriene agents. The authors use a combination of H1 and H2 antihistamines and oral glucocorticoids. Different combination regimens have not been formally compared.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10034607\"><span class=\"h4\">Omalizumab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Omalizumab</a> has also been studied as a premedication for RIT, although this clinical application is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the agent is costly. A randomized trial of 159 patients examined the impact of omalizumab treatment (for 9 weeks before and 12 weeks after) on a one-day rush protocol with ragweed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/subcutaneous-aeroallergen-immunotherapy-accelerated-schedules-cluster-and-rush/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. All patients also received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fexofenadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fexofenadine</a>. On the day of RIT, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> was required to treat systemic allergic reactions in 14 percent of patients receiving omalizumab and immunotherapy, compared with 21 percent in the group receiving immunotherapy alone.

For that reason, we do not recommend initiating accelerated SCIT during a pollen season if the patient is to receive injections for that specific pollen, because during this season, the patient is exposed to pollen in the air in addition to the doses of immunotherapy, resulting in an increased total cumulative dose of pollen exposure and an increased risk for systemic allergic reactions. Given that immunotherapy is a nonurgent procedure, all steps should be taken to perform accelerated SCIT during a time that is most convenient and safe for both the patient and the clinician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3603745069\"><span class=\"h2\">Setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accelerated SCIT schedules were designed to be performed in the outpatient setting under the supervision of an experienced allergist and nursing staff. There are no data to suggest that patients should be routinely hospitalized to undergo accelerated immunotherapy safely. However, patients should be screened appropriately to exclude patients who are at increased risk.

In a report of 893 patients treated with this approach, 2 percent (18 of 893 patients) experienced systemic allergic reactions (which were not graded), although one-half of these reactions occurred during the conventional build-up phase, after the rush portion. One patient had anaphylactic shock and required <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> and hospitalization.

Other approaches have not been reported.</p><p>As with conventional immunotherapy, patients who develop systemic allergic reactions should be treated for anaphylaxis and observed for a period of time once symptoms have resolved. Patients with mild-to-moderate systemic allergic reactions who respond promptly and completely to treatment can usually be observed in the clinic for two hours and discharged to home. However, it may be more appropriate to hospitalize a patient with a more severe reaction or with symptoms that do not respond promptly to treatment. Likewise, patients who live far from medical care or have little home support may be better served by hospitalization. There is a risk of biphasic reactions with anaphylaxis from any cause, and the risk factors for recurrent symptoms are unclear, although these have rarely been reported in the RIT literature. Deciding on the best immediate aftercare for a patient with a systemic allergic reaction obviously requires clinical judgement.

(See <a href=\"#H712008851\" class=\"local\">'Advantages over conventional immunotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with traditional aeroallergen SCIT schedules, accelerated schedules carry an increased risk of systemic allergic reactions. (See <a href=\"#H26044984\" class=\"local\">'Risk of systemic allergic reactions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accelerated aeroallergen SCIT should not be offered to patients who are at increased risk for developing systemic allergic reactions in response to the injections or who have comorbid medical conditions that would reduce their chances of surviving anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H3564496976\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To reduce the incidence of systemic allergic reactions, we recommend premedication for all patients undergoing accelerated forms of immunotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients undergoing cluster immunotherapy, we suggest an H1 antihistamine (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). This is usually given 15 minutes to 2 hours before each visit. (See <a href=\"#H17982582\" class=\"local\">'Premedication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients undergoing rush immunotherapy (RIT), we suggest a more extensive regimen of premedication that includes an H1 antihistamine and a glucocorticoid, starting at least one day before the day of injections (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Most protocols administer a combination of an oral glucocorticoid and H1 and H2 antihistamines, with or without an antileukotriene agent. (See <a href=\"#H17982582\" class=\"local\">'Premedication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergen extracts for use in accelerated immunotherapy are mixed similarly to those used in conventional immunotherapy, although the number of different solutions needed should be minimized. (See <a href=\"#H1500782\" class=\"local\">'Allergen extract preparation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Different protocols for cluster immunotherapy have been published, and a representative schedule is shown (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F69088\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69088 \">table 3</a>). Studies evaluating the tolerability of cluster immunotherapy with multiple aeroallergens are lacking. (See <a href=\"#H16818310\" class=\"local\">'Cluster schedules'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Various protocols for RIT have been published. One protocol has been studied for use with multiple aeroallergens and is relatively well-characterized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F55823\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55823 \">table 5</a>). The authors use a similar approach in their clinic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F64328\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64328 \">table 6</a>). (See <a href=\"#H26045159\" class=\"local\">'Rush schedules'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients who develop systemic allergic reactions during accelerated immunotherapy be converted to a conventional schedule (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
