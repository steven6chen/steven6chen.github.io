However, approximately 40 percent of carefully selected patients with stage 1 hypertension who withdraw medications can remain normotensive 12 months or longer off of medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-syndromes-with-antihypertensive-drug-therapy/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Concurrent institution of comprehensive lifestyle modifications (weight reduction, salt restriction, and avoidance of excess alcohol intake) can delay or even prevent recurrent hypertension in such individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-syndromes-with-antihypertensive-drug-therapy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Successful withdrawal of antihypertensive drug therapy is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=can-drug-therapy-be-discontinued-in-well-controlled-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Can drug therapy be discontinued in well-controlled hypertension?&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hypertension-in-adults#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Nonpharmacologic therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WITHDRAWAL SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Withdrawal syndromes have been reported most frequently with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> (but can also be seen with transdermal clonidine) and are thought to reflect a rapid return of catecholamine secretion or receptor sensitivity that had been suppressed during therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-syndromes-with-antihypertensive-drug-therapy/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Clonidine should be weaned slowly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-syndromes-with-antihypertensive-drug-therapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], if possible, and beta blockers, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-syndromes-with-antihypertensive-drug-therapy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], can be used to antagonize the rebound hypertension that can occur.</p><p>Abrupt withdrawal of beta blockers may also lead to a withdrawal syndrome, presumably due to increased sympathetic activity related to adrenergic receptor upregulation during the period of sympathetic blockade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-syndromes-with-antihypertensive-drug-therapy/abstract/6,7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,12</a>].</p><p>The extent of sympathetic overactivity depends upon the relationship between the rate at which the antihypertensive agent wears off and the rate at which the receptors downregulate; these receptors have half-lives of 24 to 36 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-syndromes-with-antihypertensive-drug-therapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Thus, a hyperadrenergic state is most likely with short-acting drugs (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>) since receptor upregulation will persist after the antihypertensive effect has disappeared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-syndromes-with-antihypertensive-drug-therapy/abstract/6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13</a>]. By comparison, withdrawal syndromes are relatively unusual with longer-acting agents (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guanfacine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">guanfacine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nadolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nadolol</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-syndromes-with-antihypertensive-drug-therapy/abstract/6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> and beta blocker withdrawal are somewhat different:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary clinical manifestation following abrupt cessation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> therapy is acute rebound hypertension above the pretreatment level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-syndromes-with-antihypertensive-drug-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Rebound hypertension usually occurs after abrupt cessation of fairly large oral doses but has also been noted with transdermal clonidine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-syndromes-with-antihypertensive-drug-therapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to a rise in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate, beta blocker withdrawal in patients with underlying coronary disease can lead to angina, myocardial infarction, or sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-syndromes-with-antihypertensive-drug-therapy/abstract/6,7,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,14-16</a>]. This can occur even in patients who have no previous history of coronary symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-syndromes-with-antihypertensive-drug-therapy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To prevent withdrawal symptoms, these drugs should be slowly discontinued over a 6-to-10-day interval, cutting the dose by one-half every two to three days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-syndromes-with-antihypertensive-drug-therapy/abstract/6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,16</a>]. However, the protection is not absolute since rebound hypertension has occurred after gradual withdrawal of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/withdrawal-syndromes-with-antihypertensive-drug-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. If such withdrawal symptoms occur, reinstitution of clonidine will usually provide nearly immediate relief.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101254469\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abrupt discontinuation of antihypertensive therapy can occasionally result in a withdrawal syndrome, characterized by rebound of blood pressure (BP) with symptoms and signs of sympathetic overactivity.
