In a study of women who underwent prenatal HSV serological testing at an urban medical center, HSV-1 seroprevalence was stable at 65 to 69 percent between 1989 and 2010, whereas HSV-2 seroprevalence decreased from 30 percent to 16 percent during this period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Concurrently, others have reported that the incidence of neonatal HSV infection has remained stable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Although HSV-2 caused the majority of virologically confirmed genital HSV infections in the past, HSV-1 has been associated with an increasing proportion of cases, especially among young women. This may explain why the rate of neonatal HSV infection has not decreased along with the decrease in maternal HSV-2 prevalence.

Clinical findings are similar in pregnant and nonpregnant women, and are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection&quot;, section on 'Primary infection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection&quot;, section on 'Nonprimary infection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection&quot;, section on 'Recurrent infection'</a>.)</p><p>Briefly, the initial presentation of primary genital infection can be severe, with painful genital ulcers, pruritus, dysuria, fever, tender inguinal lymphadenopathy, and headache. However, most patients have only mild symptoms or remain asymptomatic. In a prospective study of pregnant women who were initially HSV seronegative, only one-third of those who seroconverted had symptoms consistent with genital HSV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>The initial presentation of nonprimary first-episode genital infection tends to be milder than in primary infection, but the classification cannot be established on clinical grounds and requires both virologic and serologic tests. </p><p>Recurrent infections may be preceded by prodromal symptoms, such as pruritus, burning, or pain, before lesions are visible. Recurrent infections tend to have mild symptoms and few lesions, or no symptoms at all. The lesions may be nontender or atypical in appearance (eg, fissure, vulvar irritation). The duration of lesions and viral shedding are shorter than during a primary episode. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14706735\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is generally made by the finding of vesicular or ulcerated lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58485\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58485 \">picture 1</a>) but should be always confirmed with laboratory testing. Diagnostic tests for HSV infection include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), viral culture, direct fluorescent antibody testing, and type-specific serologic tests. The approach to diagnosis of genital HSV during pregnancy depends on the clinical presentation: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women without a history of genital HSV who present with an active genital ulcer during pregnancy, we perform a direct viral test on the lesion and type-specific serologic testing. The vesicle can be unroofed and a swab of the vesicular fluid and ulcer base sent for PCR or culture. PCR is more sensitive than culture and is becoming the preferred test for diagnostic testing in symptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Direct fluorescent antibody testing can be used when these tests are unavailable. Diagnostic techniques for HSV testing are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Genital HSV infection is diagnosed by a positive viral test. Type-specific HSV serology at the time of initial presentation is necessary for classifying maternal infection as primary, nonprimary, or recurrent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80693\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80693 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Classification of genital HSV infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For women with genital ulcers and a high clinical suspicion for HSV infection but a negative viral test, we repeat serologic testing three to four weeks later. If this repeat testing demonstrates seroconversion of either type-specific antibody, the diagnosis of primary infection (or nonprimary first-episode, if the other type-specific antibody was positive at baseline) can be made. If there is no seroconversion, the genital ulcers are unlikely to represent HSV infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who have a history of laboratory confirmed genital HSV do not warrant further testing. However, if a woman with a history of genital ulcers without prior laboratory diagnosis presents with an active genital ulcer during pregnancy, we perform a direct viral test on the lesion to confirm the recurrent HSV diagnosis, recognizing that culture, in particular, may be less sensitive in the setting of a recurrent versus primary infection. Thus, if the clinical history is suggestive of HSV infection, a negative viral test does not rule out the diagnosis of HSV infection. If a definitive diagnosis is desired in this situation, serology can be performed to confirm HSV infection.</p><p/><p>We do not perform rapid HSV PCR testing to identify women with asymptomatic genital shedding at the time of delivery. It is unclear whether using this information to decide upon the route of delivery can reduce the risk of neonatal HSV infection.</p><p>Diagnostic testing is discussed in detail elsewhere.

The significantly lower frequency of neonatal infection in recurrent infection is probably related to a protective role of HSV-specific maternal antibodies and lower concentration and duration of genital tract viral shedding during reactivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Women with a primary infection or nonprimary first-episode genital infection early in pregnancy who develop type-specific HSV antibodies before the onset of labor appear to be at a similar low risk of neonatal transmission as women with recurrent infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viral shedding can occur in the absence of maternal symptoms and lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/abstract/13,15,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,18,19</a>]. As an example, in a study of nonpregnant individuals with antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), rates of subclinical viral shedding, as measured by daily HSV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on genital swabs, were 13 and 9 percent among individuals with a history of symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

However, neither intervention fully eliminates the risk of neonatal herpes infection. Our approach to antiviral therapy for pregnant women with herpes simplex virus (HSV) considers the classification of infection (ie, primary genital, nonprimary first genital episode, recurrent), severity of symptoms, and the timing of infection relative to delivery. This approach is consistent with that of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60455893\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of antiviral therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3062124129\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment of primary or nonprimary first-episode genital infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women without a history of genital HSV infection who present with a new genital ulcer during pregnancy, we recommend empiric antiviral therapy while awaiting viral studies. Although newly acquired genital HSV is self-limited, treatment can reduce the duration of active lesions, symptoms, and viral shedding, and can also decrease the risk of complicated primary infection (central nervous system disease, end-organ disease, disseminated HSV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. We use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> therapy (400 mg orally three times daily). Initial intravenous acyclovir is indicated for complicated infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14708874\" class=\"local\">'Drug choice, dose, and safety'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of genital herpes simplex virus infection&quot;, section on 'Complicated HSV'</a>.)</p><p>The duration of therapy is typically 7 to 10 days; treatment can be extended if healing is incomplete after 10 days. Subsequently, antiviral therapy is restarted at 36 weeks for suppression. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Suppressive therapy at 36 weeks'</a> below.)</p><p>However, for women who have a primary or nonprimary first-episode lesion during the third trimester, we discuss the possibility of continuing antiviral therapy without interruption from the time of treatment initiation through delivery. Although there are no data to support a strong recommendation for this approach, the rationale is the possibility in any pregnancy of preterm delivery prior to 36 weeks, the potential for prolonged viral shedding with a first-episode HSV infection, and the high relative risk of HSV transmission with preterm labor and rupture of membranes. The decision should be individualized. Although we suggest cesarean delivery for women with a primary or nonprimary first-episode genital infection acquired during the latter weeks of pregnancy, this approach may be particularly attractive to women who prioritize having a vaginal delivery, since antiviral therapy reduces the risk of lesions at the time of delivery.

In the absence of obstetric indications for cesarean delivery, the decision depends heavily on the woman's preferences and values.

(See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Vertical transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classification of genital HSV infection includes: primary, nonprimary first-episode genital, and recurrent infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80693\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80693 \">table 1</a>). Clinical findings of HSV infection are similar in pregnant and nonpregnant women. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Classification of genital HSV infections'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection is generally made by the finding of vesicular or ulcerated genital lesions and should be confirmed with laboratory testing. The approach to diagnosis of genital HSV during pregnancy depends on the clinical presentation. For women without a history of genital HSV who present with an active genital ulcer during pregnancy, we perform a direct viral test on the lesion and type-specific serologic testing. Genital HSV infection is diagnosed by a positive viral test, and concurrent serologic testing is used to classify maternal infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80693\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80693 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14706735\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transmission of HSV to neonates usually occurs during labor and delivery as a result of direct contact with virus shed from infected sites (vulva, vagina, cervix, perianal area). Viral shedding can occur when maternal symptoms and lesions are absent. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Vertical transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The highest risk for neonatal infection occurs in women with a newly acquired (primary or nonprimary first-episode) genital HSV infection near the time of delivery. The risk of neonatal infection is substantially lower in women with recurrent HSV infection. Other predictors of neonatal infection in women with viral shedding during labor include invasive fetal monitoring and premature delivery. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Vertical transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women without a history of genital HSV who present with a new genital ulcer during pregnancy, we recommend empiric antiviral therapy while awaiting viral studies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> 400 mg orally three times daily for 7 to 10 days (treatment can be extended if healing is incomplete after 10 days). Antiviral therapy can lessen the duration of lesions and viral shedding and decrease the risk of complications in the pregnant women. Most recurrent episodes are short-lived and do not require intervention for symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H3062124129\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of primary or nonprimary first-episode genital infection'</a> above and <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of recurrent infection'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all women who present with a genital HSV lesion anytime during pregnancy, whether with a primary, nonprimary first-episode, or recurrent infection, we recommend suppressive therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> (400 mg orally three times daily) at 36 weeks of gestation until the onset of labor rather than no therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Suppressive therapy reduces the risk of clinical recurrence of HSV delivery, and thus the need for cesarean delivery. However, the clinical impact on neonatal HSV is unknown. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Suppressive therapy at 36 weeks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> during pregnancy appears to be safe for the fetus at all stages of pregnancy. Data are more limited but reassuring regarding the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a>. (See <a href=\"#H14708874\" class=\"local\">'Drug choice, dose, and safety'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cesarean delivery can decrease but not eliminate the risk of neonatal HSV infection. For women with a history of HSV and genital HSV lesions or prodromal HSV symptoms at the time of labor, we recommend cesarean delivery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For women who had a primary or nonprimary first-episode genital infection during the latter weeks of pregnancy (eg, within six weeks of delivery) but have no active lesions at the time of labor, we suggest cesarean delivery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, optimal management in such cases is unclear, and after discussion of the uncertain risks of transmission, some women may reasonably choose to forgo cesarean. (See <a href=\"#H14710206\" class=\"local\">'Route of delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical decision-making for patients with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and active HSV infection requires weighing the risks associated with prematurity versus the risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> HSV infection. The risks associated with prematurity depend on the week of gestation; the risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> HSV infection is difficult to estimate and depends, in part, on whether the woman's clinical episode represents primary or recurrent infection. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Preterm premature rupture of membranes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In women with PPROM and recurrent HSV infection, we suggest expectant management remote from term (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We prescribe a course of glucocorticoids for fetal lung maturation and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every 8 hours) to shorten the duration of active lesions in the mother and to decrease viral burden. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Preterm premature rupture of membranes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There are no clinical trials evaluating the optimum management of women with PPROM and primary or first-episode genital nonprimary HSV infection. Before 28 to 32 weeks, the risks of prematurity are high and may outweigh the risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> infection with expectant management. Remote from term, we give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> to the mother to shorten the duration of lesions and reduce viral shedding; there are no data showing prevention of neonatal infection. We also give antenatal glucocorticoids to reduce the morbidity and mortality related to preterm birth. Closer to term, immediate cesarean delivery is preferable because of the overall high risk of <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/neonatal</span> transmission associated with first-episode genital HSV infection. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Preterm premature rupture of membranes'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-and-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Hensleigh PA, Andrews WW, Brown Z, et al.
