Soon thereafter, researchers described the use of mouth-to-mouth ventilation and external chest compressions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Other important advances in the management of SCA include primary prevention, increased availability of skilled rescuers and equipment, particularly automatic defibrillators, and development of treatment protocols, namely advanced cardiac life support (ACLS).</p><p>In 2010, the American Heart Association (AHA) published its latest guidelines for emergency cardiovascular care (2010 ACLS Guidelines), and these were updated in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. These guidelines focus on the interventions most likely to improve survival from SCA, as determined by an extensive evidence-based review process.</p><p>Although some treatments are well-supported by evidence and widely recommended, controversies in the management of SCA remain. Those controversies related to the techniques and medications used in the performance of basic and advanced life support are discussed here. The performance of basic and advanced life support and the evidence supporting ACLS are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-life-support-bls-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic life support (BLS) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supportive-data-for-advanced-cardiac-life-support-in-adults-with-sudden-cardiac-arrest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supportive data for advanced cardiac life support in adults with sudden cardiac arrest&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INSPIRATORY IMPEDANCE THRESHOLD DEVICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An inspiratory impedance threshold device (ITD) is designed to modulate intrathoracic pressures during passive inspiration after positive pressure ventilation in order to enhance return of blood to the heart during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The device is a plastic appliance with a silicone diaphragm placed between the airway and the bag ventilator.</p><p>The generation of negative intrathoracic pressure during passive or active decompression of the chest wall during chest compressions increases venous return to the heart (ie, preload). Without an ITD, passive airflow into the patient's airways during either active or passive decompression of the chest wall during CPR mitigates the generation of negative intrathoracic pressures, resulting in decreased venous return (preload) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Decreased venous return results in lower systolic blood pressures generated with active chest compressions.</p><p>The ITD permits positive pressure ventilation and exhalation but prevents the flow of air into the patient's airway during chest wall relaxation. Employing an ITD during active or passive decompression of the chest with CPR augments negative intrathoracic pressures and improves both preload and myocardial perfusion.</p><p>Most studies of ITDs have been done with active compression-decompression CPR and therefore cannot be directly extrapolated to all types of CPR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Nevertheless, ITDs are likely to augment all types of CPR and should not affect standard CPR guidelines, such as the compression to ventilation ratio (30 to 2). </p><p>The ITD is effective at enhancing the generation of negative intrathoracic pressures in patients ventilated using a bag-mask, but correlation with improved clinical outcomes in these patients remains unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. When the ITD is used as part of bag-mask ventilation, it is crucial to maintain a good mask seal, and for this reason a two-person ventilation technique is recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinical trials of ITDs have reported mixed results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter trial in which 400 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients received treatment with active compression-decompression CPR and were randomly assigned to ventilation incorporating either an active ITD or a sham device, survival at 24 hours (primary endpoint) was achieved in 32 percent of patients in the ITD group and 22 percent in the sham group (odds ratio [OR] 1.64; 95% CI 1.07-2.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Among patients who survived to hospital discharge, 6 of 10 in the ITD group had normal neurologic function compared with 1 of 8 in the sham group, but this outcome did not reach statistical significance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 230 cardiac arrest patients, 25 percent of those randomly assigned to resuscitation incorporating an ITD survived to ICU admission versus 17 percent of patients whose treatment involved a sham device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Planned post-hoc analyses based on arrhythmias found that among patients with pulseless electrical activity (PEA) at any time during resuscitation, those treated with an ITD had higher ICU admission and 24 hour survival rates (41 and 27 percent) compared with patients not treated with an ITD (20 and 11 percent) (OR for ICU admission 2.82; 95% CI 1.19-6.67) (OR for 24 hour survival 3.01; 95% CI 1.07-8.96).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conversely, in a multicenter prospective trial of 8718 cardiac arrest patients given CPR and randomly assigned to treatment with an ITD or a sham device, no significant difference was found in neurologically satisfactory (modified Rankin score &lt;3) survival (254 [5.8 percent] survivors in the active ITD group versus 260 [6 percent] survivors in the sham ITD group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, there was no difference between groups in adverse events or in secondary outcomes, including return of spontaneous circulation on arrival or survival to hospital discharge.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ACLS Guidelines state that routine use of ITDs during conventional CPR is not recommended. However, it remains to be determined whether ITDs may benefit particular subgroups of cardiac arrest patients (eg, those treated with active compression-decompression CPR), and therefore, further research with ITDs is justified. The large negative study described above demonstrated equipoise between the ITD and control groups, and therefore we believe it is reasonable for an emergency medical system to use ITDs as part of a well-designed study to better determine their clinical efficacy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">AUTOMATIC COMPRESSION DEVICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Researchers have developed automated devices that perform chest compressions and generate artificial circulation in much the same way as manually performed chest compressions. Two types of devices exist. One type uses a load-distributing band wrapped around the chest that rhythmically squeezes the chest circumferentially. A second type employs a piston placed on the sternum that compresses the chest in the anteroposterior (ie, sagittal) plane. Both devices deliver closed chest compressions automatically, enabling rescuers to perform other interventions, minimizing interruptions in the performance of compressions, and eliminating the risk of decreased perfusion due to rescuer fatigue.</p><p>A meta-analysis of 12 studies (including three randomized trials) involving 6538 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, of whom 1842 experienced return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), reported higher rates of ROSC among patients managed with an automatic compression device compared to those treated with manual chest compressions (odds ratio [OR] 1.53, 95% CI 1.32-1.78) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Most studies were of limited quality (observational or retrospective) and therefore at risk of bias, and only one trial reported on survival to discharge with good neurologic function. </p><p>Reviews limited to randomized trials have reported different conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. A systematic review limited to randomized and quasi-randomized trials involving 1166 cardiac arrest patients found the overall quality of available studies to be poor and the data presented insufficient to determine whether automatic compression devices are beneficial or harmful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A systematic review limited to five randomized trials failed to demonstrate improved survival, with or without good neurologic outcome, among patients managed with a mechanical chest compression device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Three major randomized trials of these devices have been performed: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multi-center randomized trial reported no statistically significant difference among patients resuscitated with a piston-type mechanical chest compression device (n = 1300) compared to manual CPR (n = 1289) in survival at four hours (307 [23.6 percent] versus 305 [23.7 percent]) or survival with good neurologic outcome at six months (98 [7.5 percent] versus 82 [6.4 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Two issues that complicate the interpretation of the study results are the atypical resuscitation protocol used in the intervention arm and the additional training provided to participants. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multi-center randomized trial involving 4231 cardiac arrest patients compared the effectiveness of a load-distributing band mechanical compression device to manual CPR and reported no statistically significant difference in survival to hospital admission or discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial involving 4471 cardiac arrest patients reported no significant difference in 30 day survival between patients treated with a piston-type mechanical chest compression device and patients managed with manual CPR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p/><p>Several methodologic limitations make it difficult to interpret the studies of these devices. As an example, the performance of CPR in control groups is likely superior to real-world performance, complicating any comparisons. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ACLS Guidelines state that available evidence does not demonstrate a benefit from automatic compression devices. However, in particular settings where it may be difficult or dangerous to perform high quality chest compressions (eg, few rescuers, prolonged CPR, CPR during transport, CPR during cardiac catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]), these devices may be useful. </p><p>Additional well-performed randomized trials may be needed to determine whether automatic compression devices are beneficial in particular clinical circumstances or patient populations, but widespread adoption of such devices for routine rescue does not appear to be justified based on available evidence. Pending the results of future trials, we feel that it is reasonable to employ these devices within a program that ensures rapid initiation and careful oversight. The author has found that when properly employed these devices can be effective and reduce the chaos associated with having multiple people performing chest compressions during a resuscitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PERFORMANCE OF INTERPOSED ABDOMINAL COMPRESSION CPR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interposed abdominal compression cardiopulmonary resuscitation (IAC-CPR) refers to the application of external chest compressions with interposed midabdominal compressions performed by a second rescuer during the upstroke of the chest compression. Multiple animal studies have shown that IAC-CPR can increase systolic and diastolic BP, myocardial blood flow, and cerebral blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis identified 38 peer-reviewed studies of IAC-CPR (25 were animal or mechanical model studies), of which 34 found significant benefit over standard CPR (S-CPR) based primarily on return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) (a problematic endpoint), two found no difference in outcome, and two found IAC-CPR to be inferior to S-CPR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The studies reported a single adverse event of likely traumatic pancreatitis in a single patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Of four prospective randomized trials included in the meta-analysis, three were in-hospital studies, all of which found an increased rate of ROSC in the IAC-CPR arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], with one study reporting improved survival to discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The lone prehospital study found no significant difference in ROSC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preliminary data suggests that IAC-CPR when used in the in-hospital setting and performed by trained rescuers may be effective, and the ACLS Guidelines state that the technique may be used in this setting. However, the effectiveness of IAC-CPR for achieving improved survival without significant neurologic deficits remains unproven and further study is needed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ACTIVE COMPRESSION-DECOMPRESSION CPR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Active compression-decompression CPR (ACD-CPR) is a method of chest compression that uses a suction device to convert the passive recoil of the chest wall into active expansion, thereby enhancing venous return.</p><p>Although preliminary studies in swine and humans using this method reported increased cerebral and myocardial perfusion and improved stroke volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>], the results of subsequent clinical trials have been mixed. A meta-analysis of 10 randomized and quasi-randomized trials (most involving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest) found no significant benefit from ACD-CPR compared to standard CPR in any patient-important outcome, including immediate mortality, survival to hospital discharge, and neurologic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In addition, the meta-analysis found no significant difference in major complications (eg, rib or sternal fractures, hemothorax, pneumothorax), although skin trauma and ecchymosis were more common in the ACD-CPR group.</p><p>One multicenter randomized trial of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, not included in the meta-analysis described above, reported that 75 of 849 patients (9 percent) treated with both ACD-CPR and an impedance threshold device survived to hospital discharge compared to 47 of 813 patients (6 percent) treated with standard CPR (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.07-2.36) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The trial was stopped early because of enrollment and funding difficulties. Other challenges with this trial include the difficulty of determining the impact of the device&rsquo;s metronome and force gauge, used only in the intervention arm, on the quality of CPR independent of ACD-CPR, and the inability to control for the contribution of the ITD to the outcome. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to the ACLS Guidelines there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of ACD-CPR.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">USE OF TRANSCUTANEOUS PACING IN ASYSTOLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transcutaneous pacing (TCP) is the delivery of a rhythmic electrical current to induce electrical conduction and mechanical activity in the heart. The current is conducted between two electrodes placed on the skin in a manner that ensures the heart lies between them.</p><p>Multiple studies of TCP performed in the late 1980s found no significant survival benefit among patients in cardiac arrest from asystole and bradyasystole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/37-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-41</a>]. A larger, subsequent randomized trial of TCP in out-of-hospital asystolic cardiac arrest also found no benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. A systematic review found no evidence to support the use of TCP for out-of-hospital bradyasystolic arrest, but found insufficient evidence to determine its role with symptomatic bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/therapies-of-uncertain-benefit-in-basic-and-advanced-cardiac-life-support/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Recommendation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TCP is not recommended for management of asystole or pulseless electrical activity in the ACLS Guidelines.

Venous blood is then circulated using a mechanical pump through an oxygenator and then back to the patient's arterial circulation. ECMO and cardiopulmonary bypass are two types of extracorporeal oxygenation used as temporizing measures that allow treatments for reversible conditions to be initiated.
