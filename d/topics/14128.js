Two years later, the same investigators described a group of HIV-infected women with invasive cervical cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The series was remarkable because of the young age of the patients and because of the severity of the disease: the youngest was a 16 year-old girl with stage IIIB disease. Cervical cancer persisted or recurred in all of the HIV-infected patients despite therapy, but in only 37 percent of HIV-negative women. All of the HIV-infected patients died of cervical cancer, with a mean survival of only 10 months.</p><p>As a result of these and other observations, in 1993 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) designated moderate and severe cervical intraepithelial neoplasia as conditions defining a stage of early symptomatic HIV infection (category B), and invasive cervical cancer as an acquired immunodeficiency (AIDS)-defining condition (category C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Over 30 months follow-up, biopsy confirmed CIN was significantly more likely to develop in HIV-infected compared with HIV-negative women (20 versus 5 percent); most lesions were low grade, and no invasive cancers were noted. Of note, only 54 percent of these women took one or more antiretroviral medications, none were on protease inhibitors, and the mean CD4 cell count for the HIV-infected women was 429 X <span class=\"nowrap\">10(6)/L</span>.</p><p>The risk of cervical cancer among HIV-infected women is five- to eightfold the risk for HIV-negative women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection of the female genital tract with human papillomavirus (HPV) is generally felt to be necessary but not sufficient for the development of cervical cancer. Additional factors are critical in pathogenesis of cervical abnormalities since only a small percentage of young women infected with HPV develop cervical cancer. The most important of these factors are viral subtype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76394\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76394 \">table 1</a>) and persistence of infection. An overview of the role of HPV in the pathogenesis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-terminology-incidence-pathogenesis-and-prevention#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Terminology, incidence, pathogenesis, and prevention&quot;, section on 'Role of human papillomavirus'</a>.)</p><p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women are at risk of immune system impairment. Immunosuppression is an important risk factor for development of CIN, probably because the weakened response of the immune system allows HPV to persist. The contribution of the impaired immune status of these women to the pathogenesis of cervical abnormalities is supported by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with low CD4+ cell counts (eg, CD4 count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;200/mcL</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;500/mcL)</span> have the highest prevalence of HPV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with low CD4+ cell counts more commonly harbor high-risk HPV types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with low CD4+ cell counts are at high risk for persistence of cervical HPV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Some data suggest that HPV infection is likely to recur after a latent phase in HIV-infected women, which is rarely seen in other women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p>The degree of immunosuppression in HIV-infected women predicts the occurrence and severity of cervical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. For example, a multicenter series of 485 HIV-infected women found that those with CD4 counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;200/mcL</span> had a twofold increase in CIN and a lower rate of regression of untreated low-grade disease compared to women with CD4 counts above <span class=\"nowrap\">500/mcL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, a case-control series of HIV-infected women observed that those diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer had lower median CD4 counts and higher median viral loads than those without cervical cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>HIV infection may directly promote HPV-associated oncogenesis at the molecular level. In vitro studies have suggested that the HIV-encoded Tat protein can enhance expression of viral oncogenes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6383371\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women for the prevention of cervical neoplasia is uncertain. However, HPV vaccination is recommended by government organizations for this patient population.</p><p>Most HIV-infected women were exposed to the virus via heterosexual transmission. Thus, many women in this population may already be infected with HPV. HIV-infected women who were exposed to the virus by nonsexual routes (contaminated blood transfusion, congenital) and who are not sexually active are less likely to have coexistent HPV infection. However, for women and girls who are candidates for HPV vaccination, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends vaccination regardless of abnormal cervical cancer screening tests or genital warts because vaccination can provide protection against infection with HPV vaccine types not already acquired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

It is unknown if the immune response to HPV vaccination in HIV-infected women is similar to that in non-infected women. The CDC recommends HPV vaccination for immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) through age 26 years who did not get any or all doses when they were younger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

One study suggests that up to 30 percent of HIV-infected women with no previous history of abnormal Pap smears who underwent hysterectomy then developed vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, a long-term follow-up study of HIV-infected women treated for CIN with hysterectomy showed no difference in cancer incidence or mortality compared to the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>Based on the available data, no formal recommendation regarding Pap smear screening after hysterectomy in HIV-infected women can be made. In our practice, for HIV-infected women who have undergone hysterectomy for a reason other than cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or invasive cancer, and are medically stable, we do not do routine Pap smear screening. However, if the patient&rsquo;s HIV-related disease begins to progress, as measured by rising viral load, falling CD4 level, opportunistic infection, or they are noncompliant with antiretroviral therapy, we do a Pap test and pelvic examination at that point, as well as annual screening from then on.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION OF ABNORMAL CYTOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormal cervical cytology is more common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected than HIV-uninfected women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Colposcopy is performed for evaluation of all abnormal cytological screening, except atypical cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), which is evaluated as in HIV-negative women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

In one study with a four-year follow-up, progression to high-grade disease occurred in 47 of 391 (12 percent) HIV-infected women with atypical squamous <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/low-grade</span> squamous intraepithelial lesion <span class=\"nowrap\">(ASC/LSIL)</span> plus negative colposcopy versus 4 of 103 (4 percent) of HIV-negative controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, most of the excess risk of progression could be attributed to a higher prevalence of oncogenic HPV types in the HIV-infected women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The appropriate management of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), including optimal ablative therapy, role of postablative treatment with topical agents, and timing and method of follow-up, is still largely unknown. Close follow-up by a provider with experience in HIV-related cervical disease is essential.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Low-grade lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative women, regression of low-grade lesions is common (&gt;70 percent); therefore, many of these women are monitored at 6- to 12-month intervals without ablative or excisional treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-management-of-low-grade-and-high-grade-lesions#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Management of low-grade and high-grade lesions&quot;, section on 'Low-grade lesions: CIN 1'</a>.)</p><p>An understanding of the natural history of low-grade lesions in HIV-infected women is necessary in order to determine whether this approach is also appropriate in these women. It appears that at least one-third of HIV-positive women with a histologic diagnosis of CIN I show regression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/18,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,28</a>]; however, the risk of progression is less clear. Two studies reported progression in 4 to 7 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>], while others reported higher rates of progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>], which could occur rapidly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Given this uncertainty and lack of data to define subgroups of women who may be at higher or lower risk of progression, we recommend following American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) consensus guidelines for expectant management of women with biopsy-confirmed CIN I and satisfactory colposcopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-management-of-low-grade-and-high-grade-lesions#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Management of low-grade and high-grade lesions&quot;, section on 'Low-grade lesions: CIN 1'</a>.)</p><p>A lesion that persists after one to two years or any progression during the follow-up period should generally be treated. However, follow-up of HIV-negative women with CIN I beyond 24 months has shown an overall reduction in disease persistence, although a few women had progression of CIN during the extended follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There are no data to suggest that it is unsafe, even in HIV-infected women, to continue close clinical follow-up (cytology, colposcopy) of a compliant patient with persistent CIN I, with treatment planned if there is evidence of disease progression.</p><p>The use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been associated with increased rates of regression and decreased rates of recurrence in HIV-infected women. Based on this, HIV-infected women using ART with low viral loads and stable CD4 levels may be managed similarly to non-HIV infected women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/34,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Excision or ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ablation and excision are both acceptable treatment modalities for HIV-infected women with satisfactory colposcopic examinations and biopsy-proven CIN <span class=\"nowrap\">II/III</span> or persistent CIN I. Endocervical sampling is recommended before ablation.</p><p>If colposcopy is not satisfactory, then ablative treatment is unacceptable because histopathological examination of the nonvisualized tissue is required to exclude the presence of occult cancer. A diagnostic and therapeutic excisional procedure should be performed in these cases. Excision is also recommended for patients with recurrent disease after ablation.</p><p>Therapeutic techniques include cryosurgery, loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), excision, and cone biopsy. The success rate for these approaches in HIV-negative women is over 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Persistence and recurrence of CIN after treatment is more common in these patients, as illustrated by the following representative studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one series of 19 women with CIN I who were followed for one year, <span class=\"nowrap\">recurrent/persistent</span> disease developed in three of six who underwent excision, compared with 7 of 13 who were observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. No cases of invasive cancer developed in either group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another series compared 44 HIV-positive women to 125 HIV-negative women, all of whom were treated for CIN with cryotherapy, laser therapy, or cone biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Biopsy-proven recurrence was more common in the HIV-infected patients (39 versus 9 percent). A similar difference in recurrence rate was noted in a series of 114 women treated with LEEP (56 versus 10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third study including 127 HIV-infected women treated for CIN of all grades reported recurrence in 62 percent after one treatment, 42 percent (14 of 33) after two treatments, and 50 percent (three of six) after three treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another series of 136 HIV-infected women who underwent excisional treatment reported a recurrence rate of 51 to 55 percent. Risk factors for recurrence were positive margins (sixfold increased risk) and LEEP (compared with cold knife conization; 1.7-fold increased risk) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p>One factor that contributes to the poorer treatment outcome in HIV-infected women is incomplete excision or ablation of CIN. As an example, in two studies of LEEP, CIN was at the margins in all (11 of 11) tissue specimens of HIV-positive patients but in only 32 percent (86 of 265) of tissue specimens from HIV-negative women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. It is not known why positive margins occurred more often among HIV positive women. In both groups of patients with disease remaining at the margins, recurrence was more likely in HIV-infected compared to HIV-negative women. This suggests that in addition to margin status, other factors, such as immunosuppression, are important in disease recurrence. In two of the reports described above, recurrence in the HIV group was more common in patients with a CD4 count below <span class=\"nowrap\">500/mcL</span> (45 versus 18 percent and 61 versus 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since results of standard excisional therapy are better in HIV-negative than in HIV-infected women, use of primary or adjuvant medical therapy to improve treatment outcomes has been investigated.

This indirectly suggests that ART may reduce the incidence and recurrence of CIN in HIV-infected women.</p><p>ART appears to be associated with regression of CIN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This would also suggest that these therapeutic regimens decrease the risk of developing cervical cancer in HIV-infected women; however, there are insufficient data regarding this question.</p><p>Initially, studies of the effect of ART on CIN were limited and conflicting because of small numbers of study participants and differences in study design [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/18,34,36,52-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,34,36,52-57</a>].</p><p>The highest quality information on the effect of ART on CIN in HIV-infected women comes from a large, multicenter prospective cohort study by the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In HIV-infected women receiving ART, the rates of regression of incident CIN (299 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [LSIL], 13 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion [HSIL]) were compared before and after the initiating therapy. Major findings from this study were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No incident CIN lesions regressed pre-ART; the overall rate of regression was 12.5 percent per year post-ART.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the 312 women, 141 (45 percent) had lesions that regressed to normal cytology, with a median time to regression of 2.7 years. The incidence of regression increased over time after ART was introduced. Prior to ART, the regression rate was 0 percent; after ART, the regression rate increased to 12.5 percent. By comparison, regression to normal cytology occurred in 16 of 27 (59 percent) of HIV-negative women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A higher rate of regression in HIV-infected women taking ART was observed in women with higher CD4+ counts and low grade incident CIN.</p><p/><p>This study suggests that the benefit of ART is due, at least in part, to improvement in CD4+ counts. It also lends support to the recommendation that CIN is a relative indication for ART.</p><p>These results were supported by a subsequent prospective cohort study (n = 537) that compared HIV-positive women who did or did not take ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Women on ART were more likely to have CIN regression, although this approached, but did not reach, statistical significance. Also, women with CIN who did versus did not take ART were more likely to show clearance of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection (high and low risk subtypes); this effect was not seen in women with normal or atypical cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) cervical cytology.</p><p>Another study suggested that adherence to and effectiveness of ART regimens is associated with a reduced burden of HPV infection and squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL). In this report, 286 HIV-infected women were prescribed ART and followed prospectively. Those who used ART appropriately greater than 95 percent of the time and those who had effective suppression of HIV replication had significantly decreased prevalence of new HPV infections, as well as increased clearance of existing SIL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Future directions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaccines have been demonstrated to be effective in the prevention of HPV infections, the necessary precursor to cervical cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. A quadrivalent vaccine has been approved in the United States for prophylaxis of HPV infection and prevention of cervical cancer.</p><p>Several factors may affect the use of HPV vaccines in HIV-infected women. The distribution of HPV subtypes seen in HIV-infected women is typically different from that seen in HIV-negative women, so vaccines designed for the HIV-negative population may be less useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Also, the effect of HIV-induced immunosuppression on vaccine response is unknown. Finally, since the most common source of HIV infection in women is via sexual contact, nearly all HIV-infected women are likely to already be infected with HPV as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Minimal objective information on the use of HPV vaccines in HIV-infected women is available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) should be advised that recurrence is more frequent than in the general population and the risk of recurrence correlates with the degree of immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/39-41,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41,63</a>]. Recurrence rates are as high as 56 percent, and up to 87 percent in severely immunocompromised (CD4 lymphocyte count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/4,41,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,41,64</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, cancer can develop rapidly in HIV-infected women. A large study matching acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and cancer registries found that the average interval between diagnosis of CIN and development of invasive disease was considerably shorter in HIV-infected than in HIV-negative women (3.2 versus 15.7 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, these data were largely obtained before widespread use of antiviral therapy. Therefore, these women require close monitoring after treatment. Hysterectomy is an option for recurrent CIN in women not desirous of fertility.</p><p>We recommend monitoring with both cervical cytology and colposcopy, with liberal use of biopsy, with at least three-month intervals for an indefinite period of time. There are no long-term data on the progression of CIN after therapy in HIV-infected women. When such data are available, it may be possible to determine criteria for women who can be followed safely with less frequent surveillance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF INVASIVE CANCER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although preinvasive cervical disease is asymptomatic, women with invasive squamous cell carcinoma often have symptoms. The most frequent presenting complaint is irregular vaginal bleeding; postcoital bleeding is the classic symptom of cervical cancer, but is relatively uncommon. Vaginal discharge also can occur. Biopsy of a visible cervical lesion is required to confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cervical-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cervical cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cervical-cancer-staging-and-evaluation-of-lymph-nodes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cervical cancer: Staging and evaluation of lymph nodes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cervical carcinoma in HIV-infected women tends to be more advanced at diagnosis, and patients are frequently more debilitated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. The cancer spreads locally by extension to the corpus, parametria, and vagina. Metastases are common and occur at unexpected sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. Some patients with cervical cancer are diagnosed while hospitalized for other manifestations of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Since some symptoms of AIDS are similar to those of advanced cancer (eg, weight loss, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy), the presence of cervical cancer may be masked.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT OF INVASIVE CANCER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The standard therapy for invasive cervical cancer consists of surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-early-stage-cervical-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of early-stage cervical cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of locally advanced cervical cancer&quot;</a>). Surgical excision is most appropriate for early-stage disease, while radiation therapy is beneficial in almost all stages. Chemotherapy improves the outcome of patients treated with radiation therapy (ie, chemoradiotherapy), while chemotherapy alone has generally been reserved for palliation.</p><p>Therapy of invasive cervical cancer in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women must take into consideration several additional factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with HIV-associated cervical cancer are usually younger than HIV-negative women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most women (26 of 28 in one report), invasive cervical cancer is the initial acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV-infected women with cervical cancer tend to be less immunosuppressed (as assessed by the CD4 count) than HIV-infected patients with other AIDS-defining illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast to CIN and some other malignancies associated with HIV infection (eg, Kaposi's sarcoma, central nervous system non-Hodgkin lymphoma), the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has not decreased the incidence of invasive cervical cancer in infected women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. This is because cervical cancer, unlike Kaposi's sarcoma, was not a rare disease prior to the AIDS era and the vast majority of American women with cervical cancer are not HIV-infected. Therefore, any reduction in risk of cervical neoplasia in HIV-infected women has a minimal impact on the overall incidence of cervical cancer (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-infection-and-malignancy-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HIV infection and malignancy: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a>). However, ART may have a positive impact on prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p/><p>Based upon these observations, aggressive therapy should be offered to most HIV-infected women with cervical cancer. The patient should be informed that the prognosis in general is worse than in HIV-negative women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64747\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64747 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113542\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113542 \">table 3</a>), although this information is derived largely from women not on ART, and that prognosis associated with concomitant antiviral therapy is not known. Some women will be unwilling to tolerate the side effects associated with aggressive therapy if there is only a small chance of survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is typically reserved for stage I tumors. The choice of procedure varies with the clinical setting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local excision by cold knife conization or loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) may be adequate for microinvasive lesions (&lt;3 mm depth of invasion) in women who wish to maintain fertility. If future fertility is not an issue, simple hysterectomy is preferred. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Procedures for cervical conization&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radical hysterectomy is appropriate for grossly visible tumors that are confined to the cervix (up to and including stage IIA). Advantages of surgery over radiation in such women include preservation of the ovaries and of vaginal function. Although there is an increase in early morbidity with surgery (eg, anesthesia, blood loss, infection), overall morbidity from elective gynecology surgery does not appear to be increased in otherwise asymptomatic HIV-infected women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. The addition of postoperative chemoradiotherapy should be considered for women at increased risk of recurrent or persistent disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-early-stage-cervical-cancer#H546745501\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of early-stage cervical cancer&quot;, section on 'Adjuvant therapy indications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemoradiation with curative intent is applicable to most stages of cervical cancer, except stage IVB disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-locally-advanced-cervical-cancer#H10523862\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of locally advanced cervical cancer&quot;, section on 'Radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p>The major advantage of radiation compared to surgical therapy for cervical cancer is less immediate morbidity. However, pelvic chemoradiation in HIV-infected women is not without adverse effects. Recovery from myelosuppression may be slower than in HIV-negative women; depending upon its severity, temporary cessation of therapy may be required. It is not known if pelvic chemoradiation therapy can potentiate the immunosuppressive effects of HIV infection. However, one study suggests that the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> to radiotherapy does not enhance radiation-induced immunosuppression, at least in HIV-negative women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>Radiation proctitis is a potential complication of pelvic radiation that may be exacerbated by concomitant chemotherapy. It is usually treated symptomatically and, if available, topical butyrate enemas may accelerate healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preinvasive-and-invasive-cervical-neoplasia-in-hiv-infected-women/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. If this is ineffective, radiation and chemotherapy should be withheld until the diarrhea resolves (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of radiation proctitis&quot;</a>). The diarrhea must be distinguished from other forms of diarrhea associated with HIV infection (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-patient-with-diarrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the HIV-infected patient with diarrhea&quot;</a>). Late complications of pelvic chemoradiotherapy, such as bowel obstruction and bowel and bladder fistulas, are uncommon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chemotherapy alone can provide palliative benefit for women with cervical cancer.

Although cervical neoplasia appears to be more aggressive in HIV-infected patients, there is no consensus on appropriate management. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV testing should be recommended to women with abnormal cervical cytology. This is of particular importance to young women from high seroprevalence areas. HIV testing should also be recommended to women with newly diagnosed cervical cancer under age 50, particularly in women under age 30 or with widely advanced disease or unusual sites of metastases. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the high frequency of development of CIN in HIV-infected women, these women should, at a minimum, undergo a thorough annual examination including visual inspection of the anus, vulva, and vagina, as well as cervical cytology and colposcopy. More frequent evaluation may be appropriate in patients with CD4 counts below <span class=\"nowrap\">500/mcL</span> and is necessary in those with abnormalities on cervical cytology, biopsy, or colposcopy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform cervical cancer screening twice in the first year after diagnosis of HIV infection and then annually, provided the test results are normal. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected women is associated with a lower risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Antiretroviral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary treatment of CIN in HIV-infected women is generally similar to the approach used in HIV-negative women. Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) of the cervix appears to be most appropriate for patients with CIN II or CIN III or persistent CIN I, and topical vaginal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU) cream is recommended as adjunctive therapy in this setting. The patient should be counseled that recurrence is more frequent than in the general population. As a result, monitoring with cervical cytology, colposcopy, and liberal use of biopsy should be performed at three month intervals or less. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of invasive cervical cancer in HIV-infected women is also generally based upon the approach used in HIV-negative women. Treatment should not be withheld because of concern for comorbidity, since these patients are more likely to die from the cervical cancer than from other acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related illnesses. Elective gynecologic surgery may be undertaken in the otherwise asymptomatic HIV-infected woman with no increase in risk.
