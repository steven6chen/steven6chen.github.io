Although medication-induced esophagitis has a higher prevalence in women, this may be due to a higher likelihood of women being treated with culprit medications rather than an underlying difference in susceptibility to medication-induced esophageal injury. Medication-induced esophagitis usually occurs at anatomical sites of esophageal narrowing. Of these, the most common site is near the level of the aortic arch (76 percent) due to extrinsic compression and physiologic reduction in the amplitude of the esophageal peristaltic wave [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-induced-esophagitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H105736283\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medications that cause direct esophageal mucosal injury include the following.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H174813534\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tetracycline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> have been associated with esophagitis due to their direct irritant effect.

This was illustrated in a study that evaluated esophageal transit of six commonly used medications in 121 healthy volunteers. When the subject was in the supine position when medications were swallowed, esophageal transit delay was much more likely to occur when they were taken with 25 mL of water as compared with 100 mL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-induced-esophagitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. For subjects swallowing medications while in the upright position, the quantity of water was not a significant factor with the smaller preparations, but delay in esophageal transit occurred when larger tablets were swallowed with small quantities of water. Ingestion of a pill immediately prior to sleep is also associated with an increased risk of medication-induced esophagitis as both salivation and swallowing frequency are markedly reduced during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-induced-esophagitis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altered esophageal anatomy may also be a risk factor for medication-induced esophagitis by increasing esophageal transit time. This is supported by the observation of a higher incidence of medication-induced esophagitis in patients with left atrial enlargement and following thoracic surgery. However, it is unclear if this observation is due to altered anatomy alone or if these patients are older and are therefore more likely to be taking medications associated with esophagitis. (See <a href=\"#H105736283\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing age has been implicated as a risk factor for medication-induced esophagitis. However, this may be due to higher medication use, decreased saliva production, or a higher prevalence of anatomic abnormalities or motility disorders of the esophagus rather than physiologic changes in motility with aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-induced-esophagitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suggested mechanisms for the development of medication-induced esophagitis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Direct irritant effect</strong> &ndash; It is hypothesized that, in patients with risk factors for delayed esophageal transit, medication-induced esophagitis is caused by prolonged contact of the medication with the esophageal mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-induced-esophagitis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H259723010\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This hypothesis is supported by the typical esophageal lesion showing a small, punched-out ulcer in a limited area that was conceivably in contact with a high concentration of medication released from a dissolving pill. In addition, the site of injury is frequently in areas in which the esophageal lumen is compromised by the aortic arch, the esophagogastric junction, or an enlarged left atrium. The proposed mechanisms of direct injury include the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Local acid burn</strong> &ndash; Medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>, ascorbic acid, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferrous sulfate</a>, and emepronium can cause local caustic injury as they have a pH less than 3 when dissolved in distilled water or saliva [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-induced-esophagitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Local hyperosmolality</strong> &ndash; Hyperosmotic solutions (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a>) can cause esophagitis by tissue destruction and vascular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-induced-esophagitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disruption of the cytoprotective barrier</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may cause esophagitis by disrupting the normal cytoprotective prostaglandin barrier in the stomach and esophagus.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with medication-induced esophagitis usually present with retrosternal pain or heartburn (60 percent), odynophagia (50 percent), and dysphagia (40 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medication-induced-esophagitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Ulcers may be single or multiple and may be surrounded by mild local inflammatory changes.

Remnants of the offending pill may occasionally be identified at the site of injury.
